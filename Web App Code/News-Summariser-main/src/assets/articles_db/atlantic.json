Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . It\u2019s not perfect, but sometimes I think about the computer and internet revolution as an analogy for the energy transition . Each shift required electrifying huge parts of society. Each saw the need for crucial minerals increase and changed the geopolitical balance of power. And each sped up productivity while putting many people\u2014secretaries, bank tellers, and human computers\u2014out of work. Even among the ranks of tech billionaires, John Doerr can claim to have had an unusually front-row view of that IT upheaval. Doerr began his career in 1975 selling semiconductors for a small and growing hardware start-up based in Santa Clara, California, called Intel. Five years later, he became a venture capitalist at the now-legendary firm Kleiner Perkins, where, over the next several decades, he provided early funding to Netscape, Amazon, and Google. He remains on Google\u2019s board today, and he is a major Democratic donor. Like many others in Silicon Valley, he has recently refocused his attention on climate change. He has just published an interesting and unusual new book about it\u2014 Speed and Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now. (Much of the book is free to read on its website .) Where other climate books are exhortative or doom-laden, Doerr\u2019s is straightforward. It is an airport business book about climate change in the form of a global checklist for climate action. It ticks through five top-line objectives that humanity must satisfy in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These objectives are clear and deceptively simple\u2014they include \"Decarbonize the power grid,\u201d \u201cFix food,\u201d and \u201cClean up industry.\u201d Then the book lists four accelerants that will help humanity speed up its completion of those goals. These are deceptively simpler. They include \u201cWin politics and policy,\u201d \u201cTurn movements into action,\u201d and \u201cInvest!\u201d That exclamation point appears in the book, too. It\u2019s no surprise that Doerr, who has capitalist in his job title, sees a prominent role for capitalism in the transition. That can give him unusual perspective and a strange myopia: His decades at Kleiner Perkins have led him to see investment flows as part of a system of power to be manipulated and not, as many climate activists approach them, as an obstacle to be overcome. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we solve this problem without harnessing the forces of capitalism,\u201d he told me in an interview last month. \u201cThe best analogy I have in the book is what happened in World War II. The U.S. and Great Britain stopped manufacturing cars and appliances and for four years turned that capacity over to making, I think it was, 268,000 fighters and 20,000 battleships and a bazillion rounds of ammunition. We have to similarly make the right thing to do the profitable thing to do, so it becomes the probable outcome.\u201d This is the second time Doerr has sought to lead on climate change. In 2006, he held a private screening of An Inconvenient Truth for his family and friends. Afterward, at dinner, \u201cwe went round the table and some of my Republican friends said, \u2018Looks like global warming is real, but I'm not sure it's man-made,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen it came to [my daughter] Mary, she looked straight at me and she said, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m scared and I\u2019m angry. Your generation created this problem. You better fix it.\u2019\u201d That call to action became Doerr\u2019s calling card. He cited it in his 2007 TED Talk, in which he declared green technology to be \u201cbigger than the internet \u2026 It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\u201d He plowed $1 billion into the space, supporting more than 70 companies\u2014many of which immediately proceeded to fail. Half a decade later, those clean-tech revolutionaries had been dwarfed by the very internet companies that Doerr had imagined they could overtake. Solar companies were hit particularly hard\u2014Doerr supported eight of them, and seven went bankrupt\u2014because China\u2019s ability to manufacture low-quality solar panels at scale obviated demand for the more efficient but more expensive next-generation panels that the California start-ups had championed. Today, his original climate-tech investments are worth $3 billion, a minor recoupment. (They would have been worth far more had he backed Tesla and not the now-defunct electric-vehicle start-up Fisker, which he called \u201cprobably the worst investment decision of my life.\u201d) The recent surge in concern for the climate seems to have inspired him to return to the issue. Although his top-line goals are extremely broad, if not simplistic\u2014 ah yes, all we have to do is fix food \u2014that is by design: Doerr finds inspiration in Intel\u2019s storied management culture, which set a broad objective for a business unit and then laid out the measurements-based key results needed to bring about that objective. And the book\u2019s appeal lies in the directness of these goals\u2014and in the research that Doerr and a small team led by his adviser, Ryan Panchadsaram, did in compiling them. (That team included the political strategist Alix Burns and the former New York Times reporter Justin Gillis. I should add that I know Panchadsaram; he was an adviser to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, which I co-founded.) So each of Doerr\u2019s objectives is meant to eliminate a certain amount of emissions: The transportation sector is responsible for eight gigatons of climate pollution a year today, he says, but that number must shrink to two gigatons by 2050. This is essentially a more user-friendly version of the kind of economic-pathway modeling that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change runs in its reports. Each objective is then associated with several \u201ckey results\u201d: To electrify transportation, EVs must achieve price parity with combustion-engine cars in the United States by 2024, and in China and India by 2030. (In Doerr\u2019s parlance, that is Key Result 1.1.) Then half of new cars purchased worldwide must be EVs by 2030 (Key Result 1.2), and all new buses worldwide must be electric by 2025 (Key Result 1.3). The regimented language of tech companies has suffused American workplaces, but now Doerr has applied it to a global political problem. And that is the book\u2019s success and its mistake. Doerr and Panchadsaram have created a unified way of talking about solving climate change\u2014for themselves, if no one else. Both will reference individual to-do items, such as \u201cKR 4.2\u201d or \u201cKR 6.1,\u201d in conversation. But the world is not a firm. Humanity cannot pursue initiatives single-mindedly like a company can, and Doerr\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d\u2014the actor that is supposed to achieve EV price parity and ensure that all buses are electric by a certain year\u2014does not actually exist.  It could exist, of course\u2014that is an open political question. The book proposes several ways around this without describing the problem outright. One is the aforementioned \u201cInvest!\u201d: VC into private companies should swell from $13 billion a year to more than $50 billion a year, the book says. Its further idea to free up blocked policy routes is to elect more pro-climate officials (KR 8.2) and make the climate crisis a \u201ctop-two voting issue in the 20 top-emitting countries by 2025\u201d (KR 8.1). And while the book cites encouraging case studies about how to achieve these political goals, the underlying issue\u2014who is the political actor doing all this stuff?\u2014isn\u2019t a quibble; it is the central challenge of climate change. If we knew who the historical actor was, if we even had a \u201cwe\u201d to solve the problem, then addressing climate change would be far more straightforward. So Doerr and his colleagues support a carbon tax . \u201c\u200b\u200bWe have failed in our capitalistic system to put a price on externalities that are real and that are measurable,\u201d he said. Their plan for fighting political opposition \u201cis Key Result 7.2: End direct and indirect subsidy to fossil-fuel companies and for harmful agricultural practices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe independent International Energy Agency said we\u2019re going to have to end the use of fossil fuels. Period. Stop them\u2014coal, natural gas, done.\u201d What if fossil-fuel companies protest their own demise? Then \u201cwe defeat them in the marketplace; we defeat them in the legislature; we defeat them in the boardroom.\u201d The successful campaign to install activist investors on the board of ExxonMobil, he added, shows that it can be done. I mean, that is the plan: constant negotiation and political battle with opponents of decarbonization until the task is through. It\u2019s not like I have a better idea how to do that\u2014or who the \u201cwe\u201d is either. And the book remains a useful guide: a systematic, holistic approach to thinking through the engineering problem of battling climate change, and a set of upgrades that should be achieved in order for us\u2014whoever we are\u2014to flourish.","headline":"A Legendary VC Has a Plan for Solving Climate Change","article_name":620928.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/12\/legendary-vc-has-plan-solving-climate-change\/620928\/","date_published":"2021-12-08 11:00:00","article_length":9133,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:26.782371","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/12\/legendary-vc-has-plan-solving-climate-change\/620928\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"For the first time in 41 years, researchers have provided a new answer to one of the thorniest\u2014and most fundamental\u2014questions in Earth science. The project began, in one telling, five years ago, in a castle that overlooks the Bavarian Alps, where three dozen of the world\u2019s most successful and rivalrous earth scientists came together for a week of cloistered meetings. They gathered, in part, out of embarrassment. For the past four decades, their field\u2014the study of Earth\u2019s natural phenomena, including its land, ocean, and climate\u2014had boomed. Generations of young researchers who once would have become nuclear physicists or oil geologists instead pursued careers in glaciology and paleoclimatology. Governments, hoping to understand the dangers of global warming, had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into climate science. And the work was good. It gave humans a new way of seeing Earth: We learned to map the flow of the oceans, to chart the growth of continent-spanning glaciers, and to read the evidence left behind in lake mud and caves by ancient rainstorms, droughts, and hurricanes. Which is, you know, nice. It\u2019s fun to play weatherman for people who lived 1,000 years ago. Yet for all the immeasurable wonder and glory, and for all those millions of National Science Foundation dollars spent, there was one fundamental question on which climate scientists had not really made progress. It is among the field\u2019s oldest and most purely scientific questions\u2014it was first investigated in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius, a Nobel laureate\u2014yet central to understanding modern, human-caused climate change. But for all that importance, climate scientists would have answered the question the same way five years ago as they would have in 1979. It is this trouble that brought the empiricists to Bavaria. They wanted a better answer to the question, which is: If you greatly increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, how hot will the planet get? Read: This land is the only land there is This week, a team of 25 researchers\u2014drawn from across the earth sciences and descended from the Bavaria effort\u2014published the first new answer in 41 years . Their estimate of this value, called \u201cclimate sensitivity,\u201d significantly reduces the amount of uncertainty involved in forecasting climate change. \u201cIt helps us answer this fundamental question, which is: How warm is it gonna get?\u201d Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA and an author of the paper, told me. Since Arrhenius first tried to calculate climate sensitivity, scientists have talked about it by estimating how much temperatures would rise if CO\u2082 doubled. The new paper finds that doubling carbon dioxide will likely increase Earth\u2019s average temperature by 2.6 to 3.9 degrees Celsius (about 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit). That\u2019s much narrower than the old estimate, which said that a doubling of CO\u2082 would raise temperatures by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (about 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit). The biggest change in the new study is on the lower end: It zeroes out any chance that Earth isn\u2019t sensitive to carbon emissions. There\u2019s no way to double the planet\u2019s carbon-dioxide content and avoid fewer than 2.3 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the authors found. But they have also reduced their estimate of the chance of a major overshoot, with a doubling of CO\u2082 leading to 6 degrees Celsius (about 10 degrees Fahrenheit) or more of global warming. \u201cWe\u2019ve ruled out \u2018We\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 and we don\u2019t think \u2018doom\u2019 is very likely,\u201d Marvel said. Read: This is your life on climate change The paper is considered a landmark by other researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important study,\u201d Bjorn Stevens, an atmospheric scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, told me. In a 2015 paper, he laid out a method for how climate-sensitivity might be refined, and he helped organize the gathering at the castle, but he is not an author of the new study. \u201cIt tells us we understand the Earth system better than we thought we did.\u201d \u201cThis study probably shouldn\u2019t do much to affect our baseline view of climate change,\u201d Joseph Majkut, a climate scientist and the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a nonpartisan think tank, told me by email. \u201cDespite the controversy about the possible bounds of warming, the central estimates for climate sensitivity have been pretty consistent (around 3 [degrees Celsius] for doubling CO2). This study doesn\u2019t find different, but shows that basically any way you cut the evidence, expected warming is pretty similar.\u201d One group that the refined result does not bode well for is \u201cself-styled lukewarmers,\u201d Majkut said, \u201cwho claim that global warming is real but not too much of a problem.\u201d The paper undercuts their claims, he said, by showing that \u201cwhen you carefully calibrate your estimate and confront it with other pieces of evidence in a rigorous way, very low climate sensitivity appears really unlikely.\u201d After Arrhenius first mused about climate sensitivity in 1896, the concept was revisited a few times. For most of the early 20th century, scientists did not put much stock into the warming effects of carbon dioxide, because water vapor was seen as a more potent greenhouse gas. It wasn\u2019t until Guy Callendar, a British chemist, revisited the concept in the late 1940s that it was revived. In 1964, Charles Keeling, an American climatologist, showed that carbon dioxide was already warming the planet in a manner predicted by Callendar\u2019s and Arrhenius\u2019s work. Read: Are we living through climate change\u2019s worst-case scenario? Fifteen more years passed before Jule Charney, an American meteorologist, produced the first modern estimate of climate sensitivity with a team of climate modelers and experts. Charney\u2019s paper found that climate sensitivity was in a range of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. \u201cThe really frustrating thing about this number is that the first time they did this exercise, they got a range of 1.5 C to 4.5 C. The next time they did it, with more sophisticated models, they got a range 1.5 C to 4.5 C,\u201d Marvel said. The range proved stubborn. About a decade after Charney and his colleagues first reached their estimate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2014a global panel of scientists led by the United Nations\u2014considered the planet\u2019s climate sensitivity anew. In 1991, in its first synthesis report on the evidence for and dangers of climate change, the IPCC said that climate sensitivity was somewhere from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. In 1995, in its second report, it reached the same conclusion. It found the same range again in 2001, in its third report ; in 2007, in its fourth ; and in 2014, in its fifth and most recent assessment . \u201cPeople say, \u2018What the hell, climate scientists? You had one job,\u2019\u201d Marvel said. Climate sensitivity is something of a technical idea, meant to answer a scientific question that doesn\u2019t fully capture the planet in all its specificity. Sensitivity is meant to describe the relationship between atmospheric CO\u2082 and the planet\u2019s temperature\u2014and nothing else. The new paper\u2014which, at more than 150 pages long, is unusually lengthy for a scientific paper\u2014looks at computer models, but also the climate record left behind in earlier eras and evidence from the past century and a half of global weather observation. The authors wanted to know what would happen, in essence, if the amount of CO\u2082 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere doubled instantaneously. (Spoiler: The stratosphere would heat up in a few seconds, while the deepest oceans would take centuries to warm.) This scenario differs from the real world in at least two important ways. First, the amount of atmospheric CO\u2082 hasn\u2019t skyrocketed overnight, but has slowly risen over the course of a century and a half. Second, climate change could launch unpleasant feedback loops, causing more carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere. For instance, if runaway wildfires were to torch millions of square miles of forest, then the carbon once stored in those trees would enter the atmosphere. But climate sensitivity isn\u2019t meant to measure that feedback. The new work may represent the end of the era for this vein of climate science, Stevens said. At this point, policy makers have all the information about climate sensitivity they should need to act, he said. While it\u2019s not always clear what a change in the global mean temperature means for local climates, it is clear now that\u2014with virtually no uncertainty\u2014any doubling of atmospheric CO\u2082 would be a significant event. \u201cI think science has done a good job of putting its foot forward on the global mean,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThis could be the end.\u201d","headline":"A New Solution to Climate Science\u2019s Biggest Mystery","article_name":614581.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/07\/a-new-solution-to-climate-sciences-biggest-mystery-sensitivity\/614581\/","date_published":"2020-07-24 18:08:09","article_length":8632,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:29.539721","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/07\/a-new-solution-to-climate-sciences-biggest-mystery-sensitivity\/614581\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Steve Bullock just wasn\u2019t right. Amid the fireworks of Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate, there was a moderately interesting exchange about the inherently political task of dealing with climate change. It happened among the not-so-killer B\u2019s: the moderates Steve Bullock, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg. Bullock, the governor of Montana, began by addressing Senator Bernie Sanders, asking, \u201cAre we going to actually address climate change? \u2026 Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life?\u201d Bullock then added: \u201cYou can do both.\u201d (This insight did not come as a surprise to Sanders, no matter what you think of his politics. The Vermont senator has endorsed the Green New Deal, which deliberately ties climate policy to several allegedly life-bettering policies, including universal health care and a job guarantee.) Then Bullock attempted to depoliticize climate change: to make it a purely technical issue best left to professionals. \u201cLet\u2019s actually have the scientists drive this,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can\u2019t even get a Republican to acknowledge that the climate is changing.\u201d Read: Trump slightly revises his views on climate change Bullock is likely correct on the second point: Republicans in Washington, at least, aren\u2019t likely to do anything on climate change soon. But he is wrong to suggest that scientists will solve it. Scientists can only study climate change; they can\u2019t solve it. Engineers, technologists, and energy-system designers will solve it, if anyone can. Perhaps that\u2019s too nitpicky a point, and Bullock isn\u2019t alone among progressives in leaning too hard on the prized status of science. But climate change will be fought in part by building stuff: new train lines, a new power grid, wind turbines, and solar farms. And as any local zoning-board official will tell you, the construction of something new is always unavoidably, inherently political. The moderators then called on O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, who replied to this point in a somewhat garbled way. \u201cI listen to scientists on this, and they are very clear. We don\u2019t have more than 10 years to get this right,\u201d he said, before pivoting: \u201cAnd we won\u2019t meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We\u2019ve got to bring everyone in.\u201d Then he listed a number of archetypes of Americans\u2014Texans and residents of Flint, Michigan, and college students in New Mexico\u2014who needed to be brought into the climate solution. Maybe this wasn\u2019t his point\u2014and it wasn\u2019t much of a point in the first place\u2014but Beto seemed to suggest that the scientists can tell us only the scale of the climate problem. They can\u2019t actually marshal resources to address it. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change Then Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, echoed Bullock\u2019s point that virtually any Democrat will do more for the climate than the current president. \u201cWe have all put out highly similar visions on climate,\u201d Buttigieg said. (I would dispute this, for what it\u2019s worth: Senator Michael Bennet has a more detailed plan than Buttigieg does right now .) \u201cIt is all theoretical. We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump.\u201d Then Buttigieg, who so often cites his young age (and exposure to climate risk) as a major reason for his candidacy, started talking about Trump\u2019s alleged bone spurs. For all the lip service that some politicians pay to climate change, lots of them just don\u2019t know that much about it.","headline":"Climate Change Can\u2019t Be Left to the Scientists","article_name":595144.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/bullock-beto-and-buttigiegs-fight-climate-change\/595144\/","date_published":"2019-07-31 10:00:00","article_length":3606,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:30.583686","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/bullock-beto-and-buttigiegs-fight-climate-change\/595144\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"William T. Vollmann\u2019s latest opus is brilliant, but it offers no comfort to its readers. A uthors like to flatter themselves by imagining for their work an \u201cideal reader,\u201d a cherubic presence endowed with bottomless generosity, the sympathy of a parent, and the wisdom of, well, the authors themselves. In Carbon Ideologies , William T. Vollmann imagines for himself the opposite: a murderously hostile reader who sneers at his arguments, ridicules his feeblemindedness, scorns his pathetic attempts at ingratiation. Vollmann can\u2019t blame this reader, whom he addresses regularly throughout Carbon Ideologies , because she lives in the future, under radically different circumstances\u2014inhabiting a \u201chotter, more dangerous and biologically diminished planet.\u201d He envisions her turning the pages of his climate-change opus within the darkened recesses of an underground cave in which she has sought shelter from the unendurable heat; the plagues, droughts, and floods; the methane fireballs racing across boiling oceans. Because the soil is radioactive, she subsists on insects and recycled urine, and regards with implacable contempt her ancestors, who, as Vollmann tells her, \u201cenjoyed the world we possessed, and deserved the world we left you.\u201d Carbon Ideologies is a single work published in two parts, No Immediate Danger and No Good Alternative , the bifurcation due to the insistence of Vollmann\u2019s weary publisher and the limitations of modern bookbinding. Of all the writers working today, Vollmann must be the most free : He writes fiction, essays, monographs, criticism, memoir, and history, usually merging several forms at once, taking on subjects as diverse as Japanese Noh theater , train hopping , and the Nez Perce War, all the while dilating to whatever length suits him. (After 25 books, his career word count now rivals Zane Grey\u2019s.) As is often the case with Vollmann, his decades-long war of attrition with his editors spills over into the pages of the finished book. Carbon Ideologies begins with the confession that the original manuscript was \u201cseveral times longer than its contractually stipulated maximum\u201d; after \u201canxious negotiations,\u201d his publisher \u201cfinally agreed to indulge me once more.\u201d Not, mind you, his nonfiction publisher\u2014which he walked away from after it proposed an advance that was less than the amount of money he had already spent on research\u2014but his fiction publisher. (\u201cI sincerely hope that someday all this will be worth it to you,\u201d he writes in a loving acknowledgment.) Viking did hold the line when it came to the endnotes, which run to 129,000 words and can be examined online or in Vollmann\u2019s archive at Ohio State University . The 1,268 pages that remain are as gloriously and maddeningly unclassifiable as most of Vollmann\u2019s work. The closest analogue is Rising Up and Rising Down , his seven-volume, 3,300-page treatise on violence, which Vollmann calls a companion text. Carbon Ideologies is about another kind of violence, the violence inflicted by the production of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy. The victims of these carbon ideologies are not only the species of fauna and flora that are going extinct, the fragile ecosystems that will collapse, and the future generations of humans who will have to subsist on insects. The victims are us\u2014we who are now living and who deny, to varying extents, the degree of damage we are inflicting upon ourselves. Carbon Ideologies is a chronicle of self-harm. It is also an almanac of global energy use. The initial volume opens with a 200-page primer busy with tables, lists, and data (\u201cI assure you that there will be no harm in skipping to page 217\u201d) and concludes with 80 pages of definitions, units, and conversions (\u201cReaders should feel free to skip this section\u201d). It is a travelogue to natural landscapes riven by energy production, most prominently Fukushima (nuclear), West Virginia (coal), Colorado (natural gas), and the United Arab Emirates (oil). It is a work of oral history, containing dozens of interviews with laborers who toil in or live beside nuclear reactors, caves, and oil refineries, paired with Vollmann\u2019s own snapshots. And it is a compassionate work of anthropology that tries to make sense of man\u2019s inability to weigh future cataclysm against short-term comfort. Carbon Ideologies is most fascinating, however, for what it is not: a polemic. N early every book about climate change that has been written for a general audience contains within it a message of hope, and often a prod toward action . Vollmann declares from the outset that he will not offer any solutions, because he does not believe any are possible: \u201cNothing can be done to save [the world as we know it]; therefore, nothing need be done.\u201d This makes Carbon Ideologies , for all its merits and flaws, one of the most honest books yet written on climate change. Vollmann\u2019s undertaking is in the vanguard of the coming second wave of climate literature, books written not to diagnose or solve the problem, but to grapple with its moral consequences. It is also a deeply idiosyncratic project: Vollmann\u2019s idiolect is obsessive, punctilious, twitchy, hyperobservational, and proudly amateurish. The data he presents are at times revelatory. A homeless person in America uses twice as much energy as the average global citizen; 61 percent of the energy generated in the United States in 2012 \u201caccomplished no useful work whatsoever\u201d; from 1980 to 2011, global energy use nearly tripled. Elsewhere the data are impossibly arcane (\u201cPower Wastage by Group-Driven Machine Tools, ca. 1945 [Deducting Idle Machines]\u201d) or defiantly unscientific (\u201cI am sorry that I could not make my table simple, complete or accurate\u201d). His insatiable appetite for detail yields both irrelevant trivia (\u201cEmbarking on the Super Limited Hitachi Express, which was also known as the Super Hitachi 23 Limited Express\u201d) and magisterial portraits of landscapes befouled by poking and prodding and, in the case of West Virginia\u2019s mountains, decapitating. The Fukushima section is especially uncanny in its evocation of a sublime coastal landscape vibrating with gamma rays. Vollmann breathes a cool wind \u201cwhose degree of particulate contamination was of course unknown,\u201d hears on a silent street at night the grunting of a radioactive wild boar, and walks on broken glass through an abandoned clothing store advertising a 50 percent\u2013off sale and peopled by headless mannequins. Though nuclear fission does not produce greenhouse-gas emissions, its horrors come to stand for those of climate change, a vast terror invisible to those victimized by it\u2014at least in the short term. Though Vollmann refers to the Fukushima chapters when he writes that his project is sustained on \u201clittle more than blindness, uneasiness, helplessness and ignorance,\u201d he is describing all of Carbon Ideologies . These qualities reach their fullest expression in the statements made by government and industry officials against charges of environmental menace. In Fukushima, objects in the fallout zone are not radiated but \u201ccontaminated.\u201d In West Virginia, mountains do not have their summits chopped off but are granted \u201cremoval of overburden.\u201d Fracking \u201cis safer and has less environmental impact than driving a car,\u201d a marketing director from Shale Crescent USA claims, while coal miners, according to the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, \u201care the greatest practicing environmentalists in the world.\u201d Vollmann records such inanities alongside observations from figures such as Buddha (\u201cPeople are ignorant and selfish\u201d), Edmund Spenser (\u201cWorse is the danger hidden than descried\u201d), and Loren Eiseley (\u201cJust as instincts may fail an animal under some shift of environmental conditions, so man\u2019s cultural beliefs may prove inadequate to meet a new situation\u201d). Vollmann longs to prove Buddha, Spenser, and Eiseley wrong, and submits softball questions to every industry executive he encounters; but outside of Japan, almost nobody in a position of authority agrees to comment. Most of the extensive interviews that dominate Carbon Ideologies are thus conducted with men who work in caves or pits to produce the energy we waste. If \u201cnothing is more frightful than to see ignorance in action\u201d (Goethe), these encounters are a waking nightmare. Oil-refinery workers in Mexico, coal miners in Bangladesh, and fracking commissioners in Colorado are united in their shaky apprehension of the environmental damage they do, not to mention the basic facts of climate change and its ramifications. \u201cMostly their replies came out calm and bland,\u201d Vollmann reports, though this doesn\u2019t prevent him from recording them at length, nearly verbatim. On occasion his questions do elicit a gem of accidental lyricism, as when an Indian steelworker at a UAE oil company, asked for his views on climate change, replies, \u201cNow a little bit okay, but in future it\u2019s very danger.\u201d It\u2019s hard to improve on that. Vollmann doesn\u2019t blame the migrant steelworker for his complacency or ignorance, of course. He blames himself\u2014often and profusely. He takes special delight in quantifying, in painstaking detail, the energy he burns in such activities as writing a draft of Carbon Ideologies , walking around the corner from his Tokyo hotel to buy a tray of convenience-store tonkatsu , and making a milkshake for his daughter. These passages are as instructive as they are tedious. They dramatize not only the tenacity of our reliance on fossil fuels, but the impossibility of truly comprehending our own culpability in our planet\u2019s fate. How often do you pause to think about the amount of coal burned every time you take an elevator, charge your phone, or operate your blender? Even extravagant acts of self-denial are powerless in the face of such profligate consumption. Vollmann likens our most ambitious energy-conservation efforts to \u201ca dieter who keeps eating his daily fill of cheese, pastries and ice cream \u2026 despite the laudable fact that he put broccoli on his lunch plate last Thursday.\u201d The global hunger for pastries grows more ravenous each year. Whatever Good Samaritan savings we can make by improving infrastructure or bicycling to work will be dwarfed by the billions who will leap onto the grid in the coming decades. About a third of the human population cooks meals over biomass\u2014wood, charcoal, farm scraps, and animal dung. Nearly 1 billion people have no access to electricity. It will not take all of India\u2019s adopting \u201cthe American way of life\u201d to trigger gargantuan increases in global emissions. India\u2019s ascending to the Namibian way of life will be enough. T he demand problem, the growth problem, the complexity problem, the cost-benefit problem, the industry problem, the political problem, the generational-delay problem, the denial problem\u2014Vollmann scrupulously catalogs all the major unsolved problems that contribute to the colossus of climate change. \u201cWhatever \u2018solution\u2019 I could have proposed in 2017,\u201d he writes, \u201cwould have been found wanting before the oceans rose even one more inch!\u201d (The title of a late chapter, \u201cA Ray of Hope,\u201d is to be read sarcastically.) Nor have his six years of traveling the world, tabulating data, and interviewing experts changed his mind about any major aspect of the issue. The reader who begins Carbon Ideologies hopeless will finish it hopeless. So will the hopeful reader. But there exist other kinds of readers\u2014those who do not read for advice or encouragement or comfort. Those who are sick of dishonesty crusading as optimism. Those who seek to understand human nature, and themselves. Because human nature is Vollmann\u2019s true subject\u2014as it must be. The story of climate change hangs on human behavior, not geophysics. Vollmann seeks to understand how \u201cwe could not only sustain, but accelerate the rise of atmospheric carbon levels, all the while expressing confusion, powerlessness and resentment.\u201d Why did we take such insane risks? Could we have behaved any other way? Can we behave any other way? If not, what conclusions must we draw about our lives and our futures? Vollmann admits that even he has shied away from fully comprehending the damage we\u2019ve done. \u201cI had never loathed myself sufficiently to craft the punishment of full understanding,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow could I? No one person could.\u201d He\u2019s right, though books like Carbon Ideologies will bring us closer. The planet\u2019s atmosphere will change but human nature won\u2019t. Vollmann\u2019s meager wish is for future readers to appreciate that they would have made the same mistakes we have. This might seem a humble ambition for a project of this scope, but only if you mistake Carbon Ideologies for a work of activism. Vollmann\u2019s project is nothing so conventional. His \u201cletter to the future\u201d is a suicide note. He does not seek an intervention\u2014only acceptance. If not forgiveness, then at least acceptance.

{"id":null,"body":"I have been meaning to write something about this ever since Jim Manzi linked to Indur Goklany's Cato paper climate change a couple weeks ago and wrote that \"before anybody gets on a high horse about how CO2-laden economic development is such a threat to the poor of the developing world, he really ought to have a response to this analysis.\" So, in the interest of scrambling back atop the high horse, let me say a couple of things about Goklany's analysis ( PDF ). The Goklany paper makes two basic arguments. The first is that we are not net necessarily better off with a cooler and poorer world than a richer and warmer world. Our money might be better spent adapting to the changing climate and sustaining growth, rather than changing mitigating the effects of climate change and reducing growth. The second argument is that the problems that global warming creates for the developing world pale in comparison the problems created by more predictable issues, like basic population growth. If that's true, why devote scarce resources to a comparatively small problem? The paper is worth a read, no doubt about it. But I have four issues with it: (1) Goklany's analysis does not extend beyond the 21st century. This is a problem for two reasons. First, climate change has no plans to close shop in 2100. Even if you believe GDP will be higher in 2100 with unfettered global warming than without, it's not obvious that GDP would be higher in the year 2200 or 2300 or 3758. (This depends crucially on the rate of technological progress, and as Goklany's paper acknowledges, that's difficult to model.) Second, the possibility of \"catastrophic\" climate change events -- those with low probability but extremely high cost -- becomes real after 2100. (2) Goklany's estimates are based on global aggregates that hide the unequal distribution of the climate change burden. Yes yes, I know Manzi will say that's not decisive: As long as global GDP is higher, we can redistribute our way out of the problem more effectively tomorrow than we can today. I would be more comfortable with that debate if I thought vast international restributions ofincome in the name of global equity were more likely tomorrow than they are today. (3) Along those lines, I'm suspicious of the ethical calculus that says we should not focus on one large global problem because larger global problems might exist. That kind of moral math rarely corresponds to the political reality. (Do you think the average congressperson opposed to Waxman-Markey has trouble sleeping at night over new cases of malaria or global hunger?) Nor does it correspond to the historical responsibility: Industrialized nations are more responsible for the global problems created by climate change than the problems of population growth. (4) I think Goklany is a bit picky and choosey with the evidence. I always feel uncomfortable making this kind of argument, since empirical disagreements tend to make important differences of worldview look like abstruse technical quibbles. I also like the Goklany paper a lot. But in this case it's hard to resist. To take one example (of several), Goklany's hunger estimates rely heavily on those published by Global Environmental Change (GEC), which he uses to make the argument that \"the world will be better off in 2085 with respect to hunger than it was in 1990 despite any increase in population.\" But the GEC produced two estimates of hunger and climate change -- one that assumes the benefits of co2 fertilization and one that does not. Goklany picks the former estimate (I have no idea why), despite the fact the GEC says the effects of climate change \"will fall somewhere between\" the two. That probably looks like an abstruse technical quibble, but it isn't, and I've got a chart to prove it: Right then, back on the high horse: if you embrace anything other than the most Pollyanish co2 fertilization estimate -- the one that Goklany uses in his Cato paper -- we will be living in a world in which climate change puts tens of millions of additional people at risk of starvation by 2085.

I love the idea that we, too, can carry within us an orchard to soothe our minds during times of crisis. In this heavy moment, Lee\u2019s words remind me that days of sweetness, of joy, and of community still exist, and will one day bloom again. \u2014 Morgan Ome , assistant editor \u201cLANDLESS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\u201d BY NATE MARSHALL What is a homeland for me? maybe a boat? certainly not a country , writes Nate Marshall in \u201clandless acknowledgement,\u201d which is also the opening poem of his new book, FINNA . I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about lineage lately, about the stories we have that tell us who we are and where we come from. And I\u2019ve been thinking about the limitations of tracing those stories for Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved. I love how Marshall reimagines the idea of a homeland in this poem, such as when he writes, closest i got to a homeland is not never calling the police. closest i got to a homeland is my daddy\u2019s laugh in a spades game . We\u2019re in a moment that demands taking a history of violence and building something new, and that\u2019s what Marshall does so beautifully in this poem. \u2014 Clint Smith , author of the poetry collection Counting Descent and incoming Atlantic staff writer \u201cHELIOCENTRIC\u201d BY KEITH S. WILSON Keith S. Wilson\u2019s poem \u201cHeliocentric\u201d is ostensibly a love letter from an astronaut to someone back on Earth.

Put differently, I think of her poems when I\u2019m confronted by the mundane responsibility and the immense gift of being alive. \u201cElegy,\u201d like much of Girmay\u2019s work, collapses the barriers between reader and poet, human and animal, land and sky, briefly creating its own kingdom of touching . \u2014 Hannah Giorgis , staff writer covering culture \u201cIN BLACKWATER WOODS\u201d BY MARY OLIVER When we were 19, my best friend from college sent me the first poem I memorized by choice, outside of school assignments. Now a high-school English teacher, he calls certain poems and poets gateways, and this was mine. In middle age, it\u2019s like an old shell I keep in my pocket, edges smoothed from the surf. Its well-worn lines serve as a talisman or a prayer for when grief, ineluctable as the tide, comes for us all. \u2014 Jennifer Adams , associate director of production \u201cMOSES SUPPOSES HIS TOESES ARE ROSES\u201d  I\u2019ve become completely obsessed with Linda Gregg\u2019s work since she died last year.

Audre declares that we were never meant to survive , which is not meant to be morbid, but rather releases us from the need for validation or security from the powers that be.

How could a serious poet\u2014let alone a superb one, such as Mahon\u2014offer an honest defense of this indefensible phrase? But when I read the poem, one astonishing line after another, I realized the title was sincere. ( Sincerus : clean; pure.)

{"id":null,"body":"How certain are scientists that climate change is caused by human activity? As Friday's release of a key climate report suggests: as certain as they are that cigarettes cause cancer. So why do we keep smoking? How certain are scientists that climate change is caused by human activity? As the Friday release of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests: as certain as they are that cigarettes cause cancer. So why do we keep smoking? The report, the fifth issued by the body over the course of several decades, offers new depth and a new level of certainty, but of the kind you might have when you're checking to see if you have your wallet. You tap your pocket, it's there, but you give a peek anyway just to make sure. We knew climate change was happening as the result of human activity, as we have since the first report in 1990 . But we keep taking more detailed peeks, with more and more evidence. Photos of the wallet in your pocket, sworn testimony from 18 Jesuit priests affirming it's there, wearing pants with see-through pockets. That's the stage we're at now on climate change. One reporter for the Associated Press described the existing certainty \u00a0as follows: So how is America responding to this new report? Here is a good example, picking on CNN's enthusiastic \"New Day\" program. (To be fair, it's on-air coverage was better.) Do you believe global warming is a man-made problem? See new evidence in #Friday 's #5Things to Know for Your #NewDay . http:\/\/t.co\/mrAaiZQ26J First of all, this isn't \"new evidence.\" Quite the opposite: it's a collation of the existing scientific data, reviewed and compiled by other experts. It is old evidence, the World Book encyclopedia of the evidence that's out there. But the aggravating part of the tweet is the first part. \"Do you believe global warming is a man-made problem?\" the show asks, as we do with regularity . \"Scientists who studied for years and hew to rigorous methodology and systematically identifying and eliminating doubt before making assumptions have determined with enormous certainty that climate change is real. Fine \u2014 but do you agree, morning television viewer?\" If you're curious how they respond, take a look at the replies to that tweet. That response has been cultivated, carefully and deliberately for years, by those who would rather that the world not undertake the steps needed to address climate change \u2014\u00a0reducing the production and burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. And it is here that the analogy between climate change and smoking grows ever stronger. Do you believe smoking causes cancer? Of course you do. It has been demonstrated repeatedly. We don't poll on that because it is established science. But it took decades to get to that point, thanks to tobacco companies. The University of California at San Francisco has an archive of documents from tobacco companies and advocacy organizations spanning the middle of the 20th century \u2014\u00a0a period in which science had proven that smoking caused cancer, but the companies that sold cigarettes still denied it. Compare these two documents, one from an industry advocacy group in July 1960 , the other from a tobacco company in March 1961 . Tobacco companies knew that cigarettes killed. They discussed how to reduce the cancer-causing agents, even as they and their allies did their best to assure the public that there was nothing to fear. The priority was the fiscal bottom-line. Once the truth came out, smoking declined and restrictions were put in place \u2014\u00a0and public health improved . Now, that's assumed fact. What's really amazing once you extend that analogy to climate change, though, is that fossil fuel companies acknowledge their role in climate change publicly. Here, for example, ExxonMobil's statement on the issue. \"Our strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is focused on increasing energy efficiency in the short term, implementing proven emission-reducing technologies in the near and medium term, and developing breakthrough, game-changing technologies for the long term.\" That's how ExxonMobil wants to reduce climate change. This is like the company that produced the second document above sending out a mailer explaining how it would reduce the cancer-causing agents in its cigarettes and fund anti-smoking campaigns. Granted, Exxon keeps selling gasoline (and isn't eager to stop or raise its prices) but at least it\u00a0 admits it. Despite science and fossil fuel companies agreeing that climate change 1) is a problem 2) caused by fossil fuel consumption that 3) needs to be addressed, the public \u2014\u00a0and Congress \u2014 is obstinate about inaction. Earlier this year, we looked at the trend in polls asking about \"belief\" in climate change over time. Here's what the trend in responses looks like since 2008. Asked if climate change is happening, the blue trend line is people who say \"yes;\" the red line, \"no.\" That article considered opinion in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, a storm whose worst effects \u2014\u00a0the deaths and massive power outage \u2014 were linked directly to climate change-fueled sea level rise. But because the winter was pretty cold, people's \"belief\" in the fact of climate change had waned. And without broad public pressure, Congress hasn't acted. As part of its report, the IPCC created a \"summary for policymakers,\" recognizing that it was those who could create the carbon markets or emissions-reduction policies that it needed to convince at this point. Again, tobacco is instructive: people still smoke, but we've improved public health by substantially reducing the number of smokers. Stop checking your pockets.\u00a0Your wallet is right there in your pocket, we promise. Now do something. Photo: A man cleaning his Sandy-damaged home stops for a cigarette break.

{"id":null,"body":"Pledges to battle global warming are piling up around this week's United Nations meeting, but assessing the final results may take awhile. A parade of more than 120 heads of state\u2014including President Obama\u2014will pledge their commitment to tackling rising greenhouse emissions at Tuesday's United Nations climate-change summit. But the impact of the giant meeting will be tough to measure\u2014and it might take awhile. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon designed the summit largely as a very public launchpad for the final stages of formal diplomatic efforts to forge a meaningful new global climate pact in Paris in December 2015. Peter Ogden, a former climate-policy aide in Obama's White House and the State Department, said the summit can provide momentum for the intricate talks unfolding over the next 15 months. \"I think what success looks like at this meeting is if you have not only political leaders but leaders from business, the faith community, and civil society all interacting together and demonstrating that there is a real alignment of interest and effort in combating climate change,\" said Ogden, now the director of international energy and climate policy with the liberal Center for American Progress. The summit is part of a constellation of climate events in New York this week. Already, a march that organizers said drew more than 300,000 people wound through Manhattan on Sunday to call for aggressive steps to confront global warming, with participants that included the U.N. chief, Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Gore, and several lawmakers. Summit side-events have featured new climate pledges from corporations, investors, and nations, with more to come. Ogden points to the suite of climate announcements emerging ahead of the summit, such as the recent White House effort with several big companies to cut emissions from strong greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons used in refrigeration and air conditioning. \"At the end of the day, without being about the negotiations per se for a new climate agreement, all of this is very much wind at the back for countries and negotiators who have to ... begin the final sprint over the next year,\" Ogden said. Between the march and various other events, the full spectrum of the climate movement is out in force. Activities range from the confrontational\u2014such as fresh pledges by philanthropies to dump holdings in fossil fuel companies and a Wall Street sit-in \u2014to corporate initiatives on green energy that include major companies like Ikea and insurance giant Swiss Re. On Monday, the World Bank touted the growth in the number of businesses and national and regional governments supporting some form of carbon pricing, which is typically accomplished through an emissions-trading program or carbon tax. According to the World Bank, there's support for some kind of pricing from 73 national and 22 state, regional, and local governments that jointly comprise 54 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. There is also support from more than 1,000 companies, such as Lego, Dupont, Nestle, and Shell Oil. On a call with reporters last week, Obama administration officials said there will be a new partnership with six oil companies to cut emissions of methane, a major greenhouse gas. Paul Bledsoe, a senior fellow on climate at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said this week's events in New York show that the United Nations has learned that it needs to rally public support to make the diplomatic process work. \"Clearly a major goal of the summit is to rally public attention to the need for near-term climate action leading to a global agreement,\" he said. Galvanizing a popular movement is something that Bledsoe says the U.N. has done a lousy job of in the past, but he calls the U.N. leader's decision to take part in environmentalists' big march on Sunday a noteworthy change. \"Ban Ki-moon's participation in the march is a clear recognition of the need for popular support,\" said Bledsoe, who was a climate-policy aide in Bill Clinton's White House. Tuesday's summit will unfold against fresh evidence of the failure of global leaders thus far to stem soaring greenhouse gas-emissions. The research group called the Global Carbon Project released findings Sunday showing that worldwide carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels grew 2.3 percent to reach a new record in 2013, with 2.5 percent growth projected this year. Bill McKibben, whose 350.org group was a major organizer of Sunday's march, said ahead of the event that it could push global political leaders to move beyond the speechifying that will mark Tuesday's U.N. gathering. He told The New Yorker that he's not expecting \"immediate results\" in New York. \"This is all a warm-up for a big negotiating session in Paris in 2015. To the extent that we can build a large movement, we can help push these countries some,\" he said. Obama administration officials say the president will use his speech to tout U.S. domestic actions and announce plans to help boost nations' resilience to the dangers of climate change that are unavoidable. But a bigger announcement will come in the months after the summit, when U.S. officials offer the U.N. climate pact negotiations the country's post-2020 emissions-reduction pledge. The existing U.S. commitment is to cut its emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. John Podesta, a top White House adviser on climate change, told reporters that Obama will use this week's summit to push other countries ahead of the final rounds of U.N. negotiations. \"You can expect the U.S. to make public by the first quarter of 2015 a strong national target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in the post-2020 time frame. The president will use his speech at the climate summit to call on other leaders to keep their ambition high and to work toward a strong global framework to cut emissions,\" he told reporters on a conference call late last week.","headline":"How to Measure Success at the Climate-Change Summit","article_name":446940.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/how-to-measure-success-at-the-climate-change-summit\/446940\/","date_published":"2014-09-22 12:09:22","article_length":5930,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:35.774985","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/how-to-measure-success-at-the-climate-change-summit\/446940\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A virus has brought the world\u2019s most powerful country to its knees. Image above : A masked worker cleans a New York City subway entrance. Updated at 1:12 p.m. ET on August 4, 2020. H ow did it come to this? A virus a thousand times smaller than a dust mote has humbled and humiliated the planet\u2019s most powerful nation. America has failed to protect its people, leaving them with illness and financial ruin. It has lost its status as a global leader. It has careened between inaction and ineptitude. The breadth and magnitude of its errors are difficult, in the moment, to truly fathom. In the first half of 2020, SARS\u2011CoV\u20112\u2014the new coronavirus behind the disease COVID\u201119\u2014infected 10 million people around the world and killed about half a million. But few countries have been as severely hit as the United States, which has just 4 percent of the world\u2019s population but a quarter of its confirmed COVID\u201119 cases and deaths. These numbers are estimates. The actual toll, though undoubtedly higher, is unknown, because the richest country in the world still lacks sufficient testing to accurately count its sick citizens. Despite ample warning, the U.S. squandered every possible opportunity to control the coronavirus. And despite its considerable advantages\u2014immense resources, biomedical might, scientific expertise\u2014it floundered. While countries as different as South Korea, Thailand, Iceland, Slovakia, and Australia acted decisively to bend the curve of infections downward, the U.S. achieved merely a plateau in the spring, which changed to an appalling upward slope in the summer. \u201cThe U.S. fundamentally failed in ways that were worse than I ever could have imagined,\u201d Julia Marcus, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School, told me. Since the pandemic began, I have spoken with more than 100 experts in a variety of fields. I\u2019ve learned that almost everything that went wrong with America\u2019s response to the pandemic was predictable and preventable. A sluggish response by a government denuded of expertise allowed the coronavirus to gain a foothold. Chronic underfunding of public health neutered the nation\u2019s ability to prevent the pathogen\u2019s spread. A bloated, inefficient health-care system left hospitals ill-prepared for the ensuing wave of sickness. Racist policies that have endured since the days of colonization and slavery left Indigenous and Black Americans especially vulnerable to COVID\u201119. The decades-long process of shredding the nation\u2019s social safety net forced millions of essential workers in low-paying jobs to risk their life for their livelihood. The same social-media platforms that sowed partisanship and misinformation during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa and the 2016 U.S. election became vectors for conspiracy theories during the 2020 pandemic. The U.S. has little excuse for its inattention. In recent decades, epidemics of SARS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1 flu, Zika, and monkeypox showed the havoc that new and reemergent pathogens could wreak. Health experts , business leaders, and even middle schoolers ran simulated exercises to game out the spread of new diseases. In 2018, I wrote an article for The Atlantic arguing that the U.S. was not ready for a pandemic , and sounded warnings about the fragility of the nation\u2019s health-care system and the slow process of creating a vaccine. But the COVID\u201119 debacle has also touched\u2014and implicated\u2014nearly every other facet of American society: its shortsighted leadership, its disregard for expertise, its racial inequities, its social-media culture, and its fealty to a dangerous strain of individualism. SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is something of an anti-Goldilocks virus: just bad enough in every way. Its symptoms can be severe enough to kill millions but are often mild enough to allow infections to move undetected through a population. It spreads quickly enough to overload hospitals, but slowly enough that statistics don\u2019t spike until too late. These traits made the virus harder to control, but they also softened the pandemic\u2019s punch. SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is neither as lethal as some other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, nor as contagious as measles. Deadlier pathogens almost certainly exist. Wild animals harbor an estimated 40,000 unknown viruses , a quarter of which could potentially jump into humans. How will the U.S. fare when \u201cwe can\u2019t even deal with a starter pandemic?,\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina and an Atlantic contributing writer, asked me. Despite its epochal effects, COVID\u201119 is merely a harbinger of worse plagues to come. The U.S. cannot prepare for these inevitable crises if it returns to normal, as many of its people ache to do. Normal led to this. Normal was a world ever more prone to a pandemic but ever less ready for one. To avert another catastrophe, the U.S. needs to grapple with all the ways normal failed us. It needs a full accounting of every recent misstep and foundational sin, every unattended weakness and unheeded warning, every festering wound and reopened scar. A pandemic can be prevented in two ways: Stop an infection from ever arising, or stop an infection from becoming thousands more. The first way is likely impossible. There are simply too many viruses and too many animals that harbor them. Bats alone could host thousands of unknown coronaviruses; in some Chinese caves, one out of every 20 bats is infected. Many people live near these caves, shelter in them, or collect guano from them for fertilizer. Thousands of bats also fly over these people\u2019s villages and roost in their homes, creating opportunities for the bats\u2019 viral stowaways to spill over into human hosts. Based on antibody testing in rural parts of China , Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that studies emerging diseases, estimates that such viruses infect a substantial number of people every year. \u201cMost infected people don\u2019t know about it, and most of the viruses aren\u2019t transmissible,\u201d Daszak says. But it takes just one transmissible virus to start a pandemic. Sometime in late 2019, the wrong virus left a bat and ended up, perhaps via an intermediate host, in a human\u2014and another, and another. Eventually it found its way to the Huanan seafood market, and jumped into dozens of new hosts in an explosive super-spreading event. The COVID\u201119 pandemic had begun. \u201cThere is no way to get spillover of everything to zero,\u201d Colin Carlson, an ecologist at Georgetown University, told me. Many conservationists jump on epidemics as opportunities to ban the wildlife trade or the eating of \u201cbush meat,\u201d an exoticized term for \u201cgame,\u201d but few diseases have emerged through either route. Carlson said the biggest factors behind spillovers are land-use change and climate change, both of which are hard to control. Our species has relentlessly expanded into previously wild spaces. Through intensive agriculture, habitat destruction, and rising temperatures, we have uprooted the planet\u2019s animals, forcing them into new and narrower ranges that are on our own doorsteps. Humanity has squeezed the world\u2019s wildlife in a crushing grip\u2014and viruses have come bursting out. Curtailing those viruses after they spill over is more feasible, but requires knowledge, transparency, and decisiveness that were lacking in 2020. Much about coronaviruses is still unknown. There are no surveillance networks for detecting them as there are for influenza. There are no approved treatments or vaccines. Coronaviruses were formerly a niche family, of mainly veterinary importance. Four decades ago, just 60 or so scientists attended the first international meeting on coronaviruses. Their ranks swelled after SARS swept the world in 2003, but quickly dwindled as a spike in funding vanished. The same thing happened after MERS emerged in 2012. This year, the world\u2019s coronavirus experts\u2014and there still aren\u2019t many\u2014had to postpone their triennial conference in the Netherlands because SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 made flying too risky. In the age of cheap air travel, an outbreak that begins on one continent can easily reach the others. SARS already demonstrated that in 2003, and more than twice as many people now travel by plane every year. To avert a pandemic, affected nations must alert their neighbors quickly. In 2003, China covered up the early spread of SARS, allowing the new disease to gain a foothold, and in 2020, history repeated itself. The Chinese government downplayed the possibility that SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 was spreading among humans, and only confirmed as much on January 20, after millions had traveled around the country for the lunar new year. Doctors who tried to raise the alarm were censured and threatened. One, Li Wenliang, later died of COVID\u201119. The World Health Organization initially parroted China\u2019s line and did not declare a public-health emergency of international concern until January 30. By then, an estimated 10,000 people in 20 countries had been infected, and the virus was spreading fast. The United States has correctly castigated China for its duplicity and the WHO for its laxity\u2014but the U.S. has also failed the international community. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has withdrawn from several international partnerships and antagonized its allies. It has a seat on the WHO\u2019s executive board, but left that position empty for more than two years, only filling it this May, when the pandemic was in full swing. Since 2017, Trump has pulled more than 30 staffers out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s office in China, who could have warned about the spreading coronavirus. Last July, he defunded an American epidemiologist embedded within China\u2019s CDC . America First was America oblivious. Even after warnings reached the U.S., they fell on the wrong ears. Since before his election, Trump has cavalierly dismissed expertise and evidence. He filled his administration with inexperienced newcomers, while depicting career civil servants as part of a \u201cdeep state.\u201d In 2018, he dismantled an office that had been assembled specifically to prepare for nascent pandemics. American intelligence agencies warned about the coronavirus threat in January , but Trump habitually disregards intelligence briefings. The secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, offered similar counsel, and was twice ignored . Being prepared means being ready to spring into action, \u201cso that when something like this happens, you\u2019re moving quickly,\u201d Ronald Klain, who coordinated the U.S. response to the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014, told me. \u201cBy early February, we should have triggered a series of actions, precisely zero of which were taken.\u201d Trump could have spent those crucial early weeks mass-producing tests to detect the virus, asking companies to manufacture protective equipment and ventilators, and otherwise steeling the nation for the worst. Instead, he focused on the border. On January 31, Trump announced that the U.S. would bar entry to foreigners who had recently been in China, and urged Americans to avoid going there. Travel bans make intuitive sense, because travel obviously enables the spread of a virus. But in practice, travel bans are woefully inefficient at restricting either travel or viruses . They prompt people to seek indirect routes via third-party countries, or to deliberately hide their symptoms. They are often porous: Trump\u2019s included numerous exceptions, and allowed tens of thousands of people to enter from China. Ironically, they create travel: When Trump later announced a ban on flights from continental Europe, a surge of travelers packed America\u2019s airports in a rush to beat the incoming restrictions. Travel bans may sometimes work for remote island nations, but in general they can only delay the spread of an epidemic \u2014not stop it. And they can create a harmful false confidence, so countries \u201crely on bans to the exclusion of the things they actually need to do\u2014testing, tracing, building up the health system,\u201d says Thomas Bollyky, a global-health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat sounds an awful lot like what happened in the U.S.\u201d This was predictable. A president who is fixated on an ineffectual border wall, and has portrayed asylum seekers as vectors of disease, was always going to reach for travel bans as a first resort. And Americans who bought into his rhetoric of xenophobia and isolationism were going to be especially susceptible to thinking that simple entry controls were a panacea. And so the U.S. wasted its best chance of restraining COVID\u201119. Although the disease first arrived in the U.S. in mid-January, genetic evidence shows that the specific viruses that triggered the first big outbreaks, in Washington State, didn\u2019t land until mid-February. The country could have used that time to prepare. Instead, Trump, who had spent his entire presidency learning that he could say whatever he wanted without consequence, assured Americans that \u201cthe coronavirus is very much under control,\u201d and \u201clike a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d With impunity, Trump lied. With impunity, the virus spread. On February 26, Trump asserted that cases were \u201cgoing to be down to close to zero.\u201d Over the next two months, at least 1 million Americans were infected. As the coronavirus established itself in the U.S., it found a nation through which it could spread easily, without being detected. For years, Pardis Sabeti, a virologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, has been trying to create a surveillance network that would allow hospitals in every major U.S. city to quickly track new viruses through genetic sequencing. Had that network existed, once Chinese scientists published SARS\u2011CoV\u20112\u2019s genome on January 11, every American hospital would have been able to develop its own diagnostic test in preparation for the virus\u2019s arrival. \u201cI spent a lot of time trying to convince many funders to fund it,\u201d Sabeti told me. \u201cI never got anywhere.\u201d The CDC developed and distributed its own diagnostic tests in late January. These proved useless because of a faulty chemical component. Tests were in such short supply, and the criteria for getting them were so laughably stringent, that by the end of February, tens of thousands of Americans had likely been infected but only hundreds had been tested. The official data were so clearly wrong that The Atlantic developed its own volunteer-led initiative\u2014 the COVID Tracking Project \u2014to count cases. Diagnostic tests are easy to make, so the U.S. failing to create one seemed inconceivable. Worse, it had no Plan B. Private labs were strangled by FDA bureaucracy. Meanwhile, Sabeti\u2019s lab developed a diagnostic test in mid-January and sent it to colleagues in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Senegal. \u201cWe had working diagnostics in those countries well before we did in any U.S. states,\u201d she told me. It\u2019s hard to overstate how thoroughly the testing debacle incapacitated the U.S. People with debilitating symptoms couldn\u2019t find out what was wrong with them. Health officials couldn\u2019t cut off chains of transmission by identifying people who were sick and asking them to isolate themselves. Read: How the coronavirus became an American catastrophe Water running along a pavement will readily seep into every crack; so, too, did the unchecked coronavirus seep into every fault line in the modern world. Consider our buildings. In response to the global energy crisis of the 1970s, architects made structures more energy-efficient by sealing them off from outdoor air, reducing ventilation rates. Pollutants and pathogens built up indoors, \u201cushering in the era of \u2018sick buildings,\u2019\u200a\u201d says Joseph Allen, who studies environmental health at Harvard\u2019s T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Energy efficiency is a pillar of modern climate policy, but there are ways to achieve it without sacrificing well-being. \u201cWe lost our way over the years and stopped designing buildings for people,\u201d Allen says. The indoor spaces in which Americans spend 87 percent of their time became staging grounds for super-spreading events. One study showed that the odds of catching the virus from an infected person are roughly 19 times higher indoors than in open air. Shielded from the elements and among crowds clustered in prolonged proximity, the coronavirus ran rampant in the conference rooms of a Boston hotel, the cabins of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and a church hall in Washington State where a choir practiced for just a few hours. The hardest-hit buildings were those that had been jammed with people for decades: prisons. Between harsher punishments doled out in the War on Drugs and a tough-on-crime mindset that prizes retribution over rehabilitation, America\u2019s incarcerated population has swelled sevenfold since the 1970s, to about 2.3 million. The U.S. imprisons five to 18 times more people per capita than other Western democracies . Many American prisons are packed beyond capacity, making social distancing impossible. Soap is often scarce. Inevitably, the coronavirus ran amok. By June, two American prisons each accounted for more cases than all of New Zealand. One, Marion Correctional Institution, in Ohio, had more than 2,000 cases among inmates despite having a capacity of 1,500 . Other densely packed facilities were also besieged. America\u2019s nursing homes and long-term-care facilities house less than 1 percent of its people, but as of mid-June, they accounted for 40 percent of its coronavirus deaths . More than 50,000 residents and staff have died. At least 250,000 more have been infected. These grim figures are a reflection not just of the greater harms that COVID\u201119 inflicts upon elderly physiology, but also of the care the elderly receive. Before the pandemic, three in four nursing homes were understaffed , and four in five had recently been cited for failures in infection control. The Trump administration\u2019s policies have exacerbated the problem by reducing the influx of immigrants, who make up a quarter of long-term caregivers . Read: Another coronavirus nursing-home disaster is coming Even though a Seattle nursing home was one of the first COVID\u201119 hot spots in the U.S., similar facilities weren\u2019t provided with tests and protective equipment. Rather than girding these facilities against the pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services paused nursing-home inspections in March, passing the buck to the states. Some nursing homes avoided the virus because their owners immediately stopped visitations, or paid caregivers to live on-site. But in others, staff stopped working, scared about infecting their charges or becoming infected themselves. In some cases, residents had to be evacuated because no one showed up to care for them. America\u2019s neglect of nursing homes and prisons, its sick buildings, and its botched deployment of tests are all indicative of its problematic attitude toward health: \u201cGet hospitals ready and wait for sick people to show,\u201d as Sheila Davis, the CEO of the nonprofit Partners in Health, puts it. \u201cEspecially in the beginning, we catered our entire [COVID\u201119] response to the 20 percent of people who required hospitalization, rather than preventing transmission in the community.\u201d The latter is the job of the public-health system, which prevents sickness in populations instead of merely treating it in individuals. That system pairs uneasily with a national temperament that views health as a matter of personal responsibility rather than a collective good. At the end of the 20th century, public-health improvements meant that Americans were living an average of 30 years longer than they were at the start of it. Maternal mortality had fallen by 99 percent; infant mortality by 90 percent. Fortified foods all but eliminated rickets and goiters. Vaccines eradicated smallpox and polio, and brought measles, diphtheria, and rubella to heel. These measures, coupled with antibiotics and better sanitation, curbed infectious diseases to such a degree that some scientists predicted they would soon pass into history. But instead, these achievements brought complacency. \u201cAs public health did its job, it became a target\u201d of budget cuts, says Lori Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Today, the U.S. spends just 2.5 percent of its gigantic health-care budget on public health . Underfunded health departments were already struggling to deal with opioid addiction, climbing obesity rates, contaminated water, and easily preventable diseases. Last year saw the most measles cases since 1992. In 2018, the U.S. had 115,000 cases of syphilis and 580,000 cases of gonorrhea \u2014numbers not seen in almost three decades. It has 1.7 million cases of chlamydia, the highest number ever recorded. Since the last recession, in 2009, chronically strapped local health departments have lost 55,000 jobs\u2014a quarter of their workforce . When COVID\u201119 arrived, the economic downturn forced overstretched departments to furlough more employees. When states needed battalions of public-health workers to find infected people and trace their contacts, they had to hire and train people from scratch . In May, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan asserted that his state would soon have enough people to trace 10,000 contacts every day. Last year, as Ebola tore through the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2014a country with a quarter of Maryland\u2019s wealth and an active war zone\u2014 local health workers and the WHO traced twice as many people . Ripping unimpeded through American communities, the coronavirus created thousands of sickly hosts that it then rode into America\u2019s hospitals. It should have found facilities armed with state-of-the-art medical technologies, detailed pandemic plans, and ample supplies of protective equipment and life-saving medicines. Instead, it found a brittle system in danger of collapse. Compared with the average wealthy nation, America spends nearly twice as much of its national wealth on health care, about a quarter of which is wasted on inefficient care, unnecessary treatments, and administrative chicanery. The U.S. gets little bang for its exorbitant buck . It has the lowest life-expectancy rate of comparable countries, the highest rates of chronic disease, and the fewest doctors per person. This profit-driven system has scant incentive to invest in spare beds, stockpiled supplies, peacetime drills, and layered contingency plans\u2014the essence of pandemic preparedness. America\u2019s hospitals have been pruned and stretched by market forces to run close to full capacity, with little ability to adapt in a crisis. When hospitals do create pandemic plans, they tend to fight the last war. After 2014, several centers created specialized treatment units designed for Ebola\u2014a highly lethal but not very contagious disease. These units were all but useless against a highly transmissible airborne virus like SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. Nor were hospitals ready for an outbreak to drag on for months. Emergency plans assumed that staff could endure a few days of exhausting conditions, that supplies would hold, and that hard-hit centers could be supported by unaffected neighbors. \u201cWe\u2019re designed for discrete disasters\u201d like mass shootings, traffic pileups, and hurricanes, says Esther Choo, an emergency physician at Oregon Health and Science University. The COVID\u201119 pandemic is not a discrete disaster. It is a 50-state catastrophe that will likely continue at least until a vaccine is ready. Wherever the coronavirus arrived, hospitals reeled. Several states asked medical students to graduate early, reenlisted retired doctors, and deployed dermatologists to emergency departments. Doctors and nurses endured grueling shifts, their faces chapped and bloody when they finally doffed their protective equipment. Soon, that equipment\u2014masks, respirators, gowns, gloves\u2014started running out. American hospitals operate on a just-in-time economy. They acquire the goods they need in the moment through labyrinthine supply chains that wrap around the world in tangled lines, from countries with cheap labor to richer nations like the U.S. The lines are invisible until they snap. About half of the world\u2019s face masks, for example, are made in China, some of them in Hubei province. When that region became the pandemic epicenter, the mask supply shriveled just as global demand spiked. The Trump administration turned to a larder of medical supplies called the Strategic National Stockpile, only to find that the 100 million respirators and masks that had been dispersed during the 2009 flu pandemic were never replaced . Just 13 million respirators were left. In April, four in five frontline nurses said they didn\u2019t have enough protective equipment . Some solicited donations from the public, or navigated a morass of back-alley deals and internet scams. Others fashioned their own surgical masks from bandannas and gowns from garbage bags. The supply of nasopharyngeal swabs that are used in every diagnostic test also ran low, because one of the largest manufacturers is based in Lombardy, Italy\u2014initially the COVID\u201119 capital of Europe. About 40 percent of critical-care drugs, including antibiotics and painkillers, became scarce because they depend on manufacturing lines that begin in China and India. Once a vaccine is ready, there might not be enough vials to put it in, because of the long-running global shortage of medical-grade glass \u2014literally, a bottle-neck bottleneck. The federal government could have mitigated those problems by buying supplies at economies of scale and distributing them according to need. Instead, in March, Trump told America\u2019s governors to \u201ctry getting it yourselves.\u201d As usual, health care was a matter of capitalism and connections. In New York, rich hospitals bought their way out of their protective-equipment shortfall , while neighbors in poorer, more diverse parts of the city rationed their supplies. While the president prevaricated, Americans acted. Businesses sent their employees home. People practiced social distancing, even before Trump finally declared a national emergency on March 13, and before governors and mayors subsequently issued formal stay-at-home orders, or closed schools, shops, and restaurants. A study showed that the U.S. could have averted 36,000 COVID\u201119 deaths if leaders had enacted social-distancing measures just a week earlier. But better late than never: By collectively reducing the spread of the virus, America flattened the curve. Ventilators didn\u2019t run out, as they had in parts of Italy. Hospitals had time to add extra beds. Social distancing worked. But the indiscriminate lockdown was necessary only because America\u2019s leaders wasted months of prep time. Deploying this blunt policy instrument came at enormous cost. Unemployment rose to 14.7 percent, the highest level since record-keeping began, in 1948. More than 26 million people lost their jobs, a catastrophe in a country that\u2014uniquely and absurdly\u2014ties health care to employment. Some COVID\u201119 survivors have been hit with seven-figure medical bills . In the middle of the greatest health and economic crises in generations, millions of Americans have found themselves disconnected from medical care and impoverished. They join the millions who have always lived that way. The coronavirus found, exploited, and widened every inequity that the U.S. had to offer. Elderly people, already pushed to the fringes of society, were treated as acceptable losses . Women were more likely to lose jobs than men, and also shouldered extra burdens of child care and domestic work, while facing rising rates of domestic violence. In half of the states, people with dementia and intellectual disabilities faced policies that threatened to deny them access to lifesaving ventilators . Thousands of people endured months of COVID\u201119 symptoms that resembled those of chronic postviral illnesses, only to be told that their devastating symptoms were in their head. Latinos were three times as likely to be infected as white people. Asian Americans faced racist abuse. Far from being a \u201cgreat equalizer,\u201d the pandemic fell unevenly upon the U.S., taking advantage of injustices that had been brewing throughout the nation\u2019s history. Read: COVID-19 can last for several months Of the 3.1 million Americans who still cannot afford health insurance in states where Medicaid has not been expanded, more than half are people of color, and 30 percent are Black . * This is no accident. In the decades after the Civil War, the white leaders of former slave states deliberately withheld health care from Black Americans, apportioning medicine more according to the logic of Jim Crow than Hippocrates . They built hospitals away from Black communities, segregated Black patients into separate wings, and blocked Black students from medical school. In the 20th century, they helped construct America\u2019s system of private, employer-based insurance, which has kept many Black people from receiving adequate medical treatment. They fought every attempt to improve Black people\u2019s access to health care , from the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in the \u201960s to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. A number of former slave states also have among the lowest investments in public health, the lowest quality of medical care, the highest proportions of Black citizens, and the greatest racial divides in health outcomes. As the COVID\u201119 pandemic wore on, they were among the quickest to lift social-distancing restrictions and reexpose their citizens to the coronavirus. The harms of these moves were unduly foisted upon the poor and the Black. As of early July, one in every 1,450 Black Americans had died from COVID\u201119\u2014a rate more than twice that of white Americans. That figure is both tragic and wholly expected given the mountain of medical disadvantages that Black people face. Compared with white people, they die three years younger. Three times as many Black mothers die during pregnancy . Black people have higher rates of chronic illnesses that predispose them to fatal cases of COVID\u201119. When they go to hospitals, they\u2019re less likely to be treated. The care they do receive tends to be poorer. Aware of these biases, Black people are hesitant to seek aid for COVID\u201119 symptoms and then show up at hospitals in sicker states . \u201cOne of my patients said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital, because they\u2019re not going to treat me well,\u2019\u200a\u201d says Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, an emergency physician and the founder of Advancing Health Equity, a nonprofit that fights bias and racism in health care. \u201cAnother whispered to me, \u2018I\u2019m so relieved you\u2019re Black. I just want to make sure I\u2019m listened to.\u2019\u200a\u201d Black people were both more worried about the pandemic and more likely to be infected by it. The dismantling of America\u2019s social safety net left Black people with less income and higher unemployment . They make up a disproportionate share of the low-paid \u201cessential workers\u201d who were expected to staff grocery stores and warehouses, clean buildings, and deliver mail while the pandemic raged around them. Earning hourly wages without paid sick leave, they couldn\u2019t afford to miss shifts even when symptomatic. They faced risky commutes on crowded public transportation while more privileged people teleworked from the safety of isolation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about Blackness that makes you more prone to COVID,\u201d says Nicolette Louissaint, the executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit that works to strengthen medical supply chains. Instead, existing inequities stack the odds in favor of the virus. Native Americans were similarly vulnerable. A third of the people in the Navajo Nation can\u2019t easily wash their hands, because they\u2019ve been embroiled in long-running negotiations over the rights to the water on their own lands . Those with water must contend with runoff from uranium mines. Most live in cramped multigenerational homes, far from the few hospitals that service a 17-million-acre reservation. As of mid-May, the Navajo Nation had higher rates of COVID\u201119 infections than any U.S. state. Americans often misperceive historical inequities as personal failures. Stephen Huffman, a Republican state senator and doctor in Ohio, suggested that Black Americans might be more prone to COVID\u201119 because they don\u2019t wash their hands enough, a remark for which he later apologized. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also a physician, noted that Black people have higher rates of chronic disease, as if this were an answer in itself, and not a pattern that demanded further explanation. Clear distribution of accurate information is among the most important defenses against an epidemic\u2019s spread. And yet the largely unregulated, social-media-based communications infrastructure of the 21st century almost ensures that misinformation will proliferate fast. \u201cIn every outbreak throughout the existence of social media, from Zika to Ebola, conspiratorial communities immediately spread their content about how it\u2019s all caused by some government or pharmaceutical company or Bill Gates,\u201d says Ren\u00e9e DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory, who studies the flow of online information. When COVID\u201119 arrived, \u201cthere was no doubt in my mind that it was coming.\u201d Read: The great 5G conspiracy Sure enough, existing conspiracy theories\u2014George Soros! 5G! Bioweapons!\u2014were repurposed for the pandemic. An infodemic of falsehoods spread alongside the actual virus. Rumors coursed through online platforms that are designed to keep users engaged , even if that means feeding them content that is polarizing or untrue . In a national crisis, when people need to act in concert, this is calamitous. \u201cThe social internet as a system is broken,\u201d DiResta told me, and its faults are readily abused. Beginning on April 16, DiResta\u2019s team noticed growing online chatter about Judy Mikovits , a discredited researcher turned anti-vaccination champion. Posts and videos cast Mikovits as a whistleblower who claimed that the new coronavirus was made in a lab and described Anthony Fauci of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force as her nemesis. Ironically, this conspiracy theory was nested inside a larger conspiracy\u2014part of an orchestrated PR campaign by an anti-vaxxer and QAnon fan with the explicit goal to \u201ctake down Anthony Fauci.\u201d It culminated in a slickly produced video called Plandemic , which was released on May 4. More than 8 million people watched it in a week. Doctors and journalists tried to debunk Plandemic \u2019s many misleading claims , but these efforts spread less successfully than the video itself. Like pandemics, infodemics quickly become uncontrollable unless caught early. But while health organizations recognize the need to surveil for emerging diseases, they are woefully unprepared to do the same for emerging conspiracies. In 2016, when DiResta spoke with a CDC team about the threat of misinformation, \u201ctheir response was: \u2018\u2009 That\u2019s interesting, but that\u2019s just stuff that happens on the internet.\u2019\u200a\u201d From the June 2020 issue: Adrienne LaFrance on how QAnon is more important than you think Rather than countering misinformation during the pandemic\u2019s early stages, trusted sources often made things worse . Many health experts and government officials downplayed the threat of the virus in January and February, assuring the public that it posed a low risk to the U.S. and drawing comparisons to the ostensibly greater threat of the flu. The WHO, the CDC, and the U.S. surgeon general urged people not to wear masks, hoping to preserve the limited stocks for health-care workers. These messages were offered without nuance or acknowledgement of uncertainty, so when they were reversed\u2014the virus is worse than the flu; wear masks \u2014the changes seemed like befuddling flip-flops. The media added to the confusion. Drawn to novelty, journalists gave oxygen to fringe anti-lockdown protests while most Americans quietly stayed home. They wrote up every incremental scientific claim, even those that hadn\u2019t been verified or peer-reviewed. There were many such claims to choose from. By tying career advancement to the publishing of papers, academia already creates incentives for scientists to do attention-grabbing but irreproducible work. The pandemic strengthened those incentives by prompting a rush of panicked research and promising ambitious scientists global attention. In March, a small and severely flawed French study suggested that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID\u201119. Published in a minor journal, it likely would have been ignored a decade ago. But in 2020, it wended its way to Donald Trump via a chain of credulity that included Fox News, Elon Musk, and Dr. Oz. Trump spent months touting the drug as a miracle cure despite mounting evidence to the contrary, causing shortages for people who actually needed it to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The hydroxychloroquine story was muddied even further by a study published in a top medical journal, The Lancet, that claimed the drug was not effective and was potentially harmful. The paper relied on suspect data from a small analytics company called Surgisphere, and was retracted in June. ** Science famously self-corrects. But during the pandemic, the same urgent pace that has produced valuable knowledge at record speed has also sent sloppy claims around the world before anyone could even raise a skeptical eyebrow. The ensuing confusion, and the many genuine unknowns about the virus, has created a vortex of fear and uncertainty, which grifters have sought to exploit. Snake-oil merchants have peddled ineffectual silver bullets ( including actual silver ). Armchair experts with scant or absent qualifications have found regular slots on the nightly news. And at the center of that confusion is Donald Trump. During a pandemic, leaders must rally the public, tell the truth, and speak clearly and consistently. Instead, Trump repeatedly contradicted public-health experts, his scientific advisers, and himself . He said that \u201cnobody ever thought a thing like [the pandemic] could happen\u201d and also that he \u201cfelt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u201d Both statements cannot be true at the same time, and in fact neither is true. A month before his inauguration, I wrote that \u201cthe question isn\u2019t whether [Trump will] face a deadly outbreak during his presidency, but when.\u201d Based on his actions as a media personality during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and as a candidate in the 2016 election, I suggested that he would fail at diplomacy, close borders, tweet rashly, spread conspiracy theories, ignore experts, and exhibit reckless self-confidence. And so he did. No one should be shocked that a liar who has made almost 20,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency would lie about whether the U.S. had the pandemic under control; that a racist who gave birth to birtherism would do little to stop a virus that was disproportionately killing Black people; that a xenophobe who presided over the creation of new immigrant-detention centers would order meatpacking plants with a substantial immigrant workforce to remain open; that a cruel man devoid of empathy would fail to calm fearful citizens; that a narcissist who cannot stand to be upstaged would refuse to tap the deep well of experts at his disposal; that a scion of nepotism would hand control of a shadow coronavirus task force to his unqualified son-in-law; that an armchair polymath would claim to have a \u201cnatural ability\u201d at medicine and display it by wondering out loud about the curative potential of injecting disinfectant; that an egotist incapable of admitting failure would try to distract from his greatest one by blaming China, defunding the WHO, and promoting miracle drugs; or that a president who has been shielded by his party from any shred of accountability would say, when asked about the lack of testing, \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility at all.\u201d Trump is a comorbidity of the COVID\u201119 pandemic. He isn\u2019t solely responsible for America\u2019s fiasco, but he is central to it. A pandemic demands the coordinated efforts of dozens of agencies. \u201cIn the best circumstances, it\u2019s hard to make the bureaucracy move quickly,\u201d Ron Klain said. \u201cIt moves if the president stands on a table and says, \u2018Move quickly.\u2019 But it really doesn\u2019t move if he\u2019s sitting at his desk saying it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d In the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency, many believed that America\u2019s institutions would check his excesses. They have, in part, but Trump has also corrupted them . The CDC is but his latest victim. On February 25, the agency\u2019s respiratory-disease chief, Nancy Messonnier, shocked people by raising the possibility of school closures and saying that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe.\u201d Trump was reportedly enraged. In response, he seems to have benched the entire agency. The CDC led the way in every recent domestic disease outbreak and has been the inspiration and template for public-health agencies around the world. But during the three months when some 2 million Americans contracted COVID\u201119 and the death toll topped 100,000, the agency didn\u2019t hold a single press conference. Its detailed guidelines on reopening the country were shelved for a month while the White House released its own uselessly vague plan. Again, everyday Americans did more than the White House. By voluntarily agreeing to months of social distancing, they bought the country time, at substantial cost to their financial and mental well-being. Their sacrifice came with an implicit social contract\u2014that the government would use the valuable time to mobilize an extraordinary, energetic effort to suppress the virus, as did the likes of Germany and Singapore. But the government did not, to the bafflement of health experts. \u201cThere are instances in history where humanity has really moved mountains to defeat infectious diseases,\u201d says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that we in the U.S. have not summoned that energy around COVID\u201119.\u201d Instead, the U.S. sleepwalked into the worst possible scenario: People suffered all the debilitating effects of a lockdown with few of the benefits. Most states felt compelled to reopen without accruing enough tests or contact tracers. In April and May, the nation was stuck on a terrible plateau, averaging 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day. In June, the plateau again became an upward slope, soaring to record-breaking heights. Read: Ed Yong on living in a patchwork pandemic Trump never rallied the country. Despite declaring himself a \u201cwartime president,\u201d he merely presided over a culture war, turning public health into yet another politicized cage match. Abetted by supporters in the conservative media, he framed measures that protect against the virus, from masks to social distancing, as liberal and anti-American. Armed anti-lockdown protesters demonstrated at government buildings while Trump egged them on, urging them to \u201cLIBERATE\u201d Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia. Several public-health officials left their jobs over harassment and threats . It is no coincidence that other powerful nations that elected populist leaders\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, and the United Kingdom\u2014also fumbled their response to COVID\u201119. \u201cWhen you have people elected based on undermining trust in the government, what happens when trust is what you need the most?\u201d says Sarah Dalglish of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who studies the political determinants of health. \u201cTrump is president,\u201d she says. \u201cHow could it go well?\u201d The countries that fared better against COVID\u201119 didn\u2019t follow a universal playbook. Many used masks widely; New Zealand didn\u2019t. Many tested extensively; Japan didn\u2019t. Many had science-minded leaders who acted early; Hong Kong didn\u2019t\u2014instead, a grassroots movement compensated for a lax government . Many were small islands; not large and continental Germany. Each nation succeeded because it did enough things right. Read: What really doomed America\u2019s coronavirus response Meanwhile, the United States underperformed across the board, and its errors compounded. The dearth of tests allowed unconfirmed cases to create still more cases, which flooded the hospitals, which ran out of masks, which are necessary to limit the virus\u2019s spread. Twitter amplified Trump\u2019s misleading messages, which raised fear and anxiety among people, which led them to spend more time scouring for information on Twitter. Even seasoned health experts underestimated these compounded risks. Yes, having Trump at the helm during a pandemic was worrying, but it was tempting to think that national wealth and technological superiority would save America. \u201cWe are a rich country, and we think we can stop any infectious disease because of that,\u201d says Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBut dollar bills alone are no match against a virus.\u201d Public-health experts talk wearily about the panic-neglect cycle, in which outbreaks trigger waves of attention and funding that quickly dissipate once the diseases recede. This time around, the U.S. is already flirting with neglect, before the panic phase is over. The virus was never beaten in the spring, but many people, including Trump, pretended that it was . Every state reopened to varying degrees, and many subsequently saw record numbers of cases. After Arizona\u2019s cases started climbing sharply at the end of May, Cara Christ, the director of the state\u2019s health-services department, said, \u201cWe are not going to be able to stop the spread. And so we can\u2019t stop living as well.\u201d The virus may beg to differ. At times, Americans have seemed to collectively surrender to COVID\u201119. The White House\u2019s coronavirus task force wound down. Trump resumed holding rallies, and called for less testing, so that official numbers would be rosier. The country behaved like a horror-movie character who believes the danger is over, even though the monster is still at large. The long wait for a vaccine will likely culminate in a predictable way: Many Americans will refuse to get it, and among those who want it, the most vulnerable will be last in line. Still, there is some reason for hope. Many of the people I interviewed tentatively suggested that the upheaval wrought by COVID\u201119 might be so large as to permanently change the nation\u2019s disposition. Experience, after all, sharpens the mind. East Asian states that had lived through the SARS and MERS epidemics reacted quickly when threatened by SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, spurred by a cultural memory of what a fast-moving coronavirus can do. But the U.S. had barely been touched by the major epidemics of past decades (with the exception of the H1N1 flu). In 2019, more Americans were concerned about terrorists and cyberattacks than about outbreaks of exotic diseases. Perhaps they will emerge from this pandemic with immunity both cellular and cultural. There are also a few signs that Americans are learning important lessons. A June survey showed that 60 to 75 percent of Americans were still practicing social distancing. A partisan gap exists, but it has narrowed. \u201cIn public-opinion polling in the U.S., high-60s agreement on anything is an amazing accomplishment,\u201d says Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern University, who led the survey. Polls in May also showed that most Democrats and Republicans supported mask wearing , and felt it should be mandatory in at least some indoor spaces. It is almost unheard-of for a public-health measure to go from zero to majority acceptance in less than half a year. But pandemics are rare situations when \u201cpeople are desperate for guidelines and rules,\u201d says Zo\u00eb McLaren, a health-policy professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County. The closest analogy is pregnancy, she says, which is \u201ca time when women\u2019s lives are changing, and they can absorb a ton of information. A pandemic is similar: People are actually paying attention, and learning.\u201d Redbird\u2019s survey suggests that Americans indeed sought out new sources of information\u2014and that consumers of news from conservative outlets, in particular, expanded their media diet. People of all political bents became more dissatisfied with the Trump administration. As the economy nose-dived, the health-care system ailed, and the government fumbled, belief in American exceptionalism declined. \u201cTimes of big social disruption call into question things we thought were normal and standard,\u201d Redbird told me. \u201cIf our institutions fail us here, in what ways are they failing elsewhere?\u201d And whom are they failing the most? Americans were in the mood for systemic change. Then, on May 25, George Floyd, who had survived COVID\u201119\u2019s assault on his airway, asphyxiated under the crushing pressure of a police officer\u2019s knee. The excruciating video of his killing circulated through communities that were still reeling from the deaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and disproportionate casualties from COVID\u201119. America\u2019s simmering outrage came to a boil and spilled into its streets . Defiant and largely cloaked in masks, protesters turned out in more than 2,000 cities and towns. Support for Black Lives Matter soared : For the first time since its founding in 2013, the movement had majority approval across racial groups. These protests were not about the pandemic, but individual protesters had been primed by months of shocking governmental missteps. Even people who might once have ignored evidence of police brutality recognized yet another broken institution. They could no longer look away. It is hard to stare directly at the biggest problems of our age. Pandemics, climate change, the sixth extinction of wildlife, food and water shortages\u2014their scope is planetary, and their stakes are overwhelming. We have no choice, though, but to grapple with them. It is now abundantly clear what happens when global disasters collide with historical negligence. COVID\u201119 is an assault on America\u2019s body, and a referendum on the ideas that animate its culture. Recovery is possible, but it demands radical introspection. America would be wise to help reverse the ruination of the natural world, a process that continues to shunt animal diseases into human bodies. It should strive to prevent sickness instead of profiting from it. It should build a health-care system that prizes resilience over brittle efficiency, and an information system that favors light over heat. It should rebuild its international alliances, its social safety net, and its trust in empiricism. It should address the health inequities that flow from its history. Not least, it should elect leaders with sound judgment, high character, and respect for science, logic, and reason. The pandemic has been both tragedy and teacher. Its very etymology offers a clue about what is at stake in the greatest challenges of the future, and what is needed to address them. Pandemic.  Pan and demos .

{"id":null,"body":"The worst extinction in Earth\u2019s history offers chilling predictions for the planet\u2019s future\u2014and for humanity\u2019s efforts to keep climate doom at bay. Identifying a killer can be difficult when it seems like every murder weapon imaginable has been used in the crime, and when the victim is the entire planet. About 252 million years ago, a rich and wonderful world was annihilated in the worst mass extinction ever: the end-Permian, a catastrophe with no close competitor in Earth\u2019s history. Volcanoes of a truly preposterous scale erupted in Siberia over many thousands of years, loosing all manner of chaos on the world. Rounding up, everything died. Diagnosing the particular flavor of chaos responsible for this mass death has proven elusive. The Siberian Traps, now long retired as a vast swath of basalt plateaus in the far northern reaches of Russia, might have poisoned the world with mercury. Or maybe they destroyed the ozone layer by incinerating huge underground layers of ancient evaporites. Or perhaps they acidified the planet with sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, stripping vegetation, killing corals worldwide, and altering the chemistry of the planet\u2019s soil so that dirt would have tasted like vanilla. Or maybe the Siberian Traps wracked the planet with brief volcanic winters, or they poisoned the planet with carbon dioxide itself, or the oceans became stagnant and poisoned with toxic hydrogen sulfide. Maybe that\u2019s what killed everything. Or maybe the oceans became stratified and nutrient-starved, and phytoplankton suffered. Or perhaps it was a lack of oxygen in the ocean that suffocated everything, or maybe it got just too damn hot. Some paleontologists have thrown up their hands and yielded to this overdetermination of kill mechanisms at the end-Permian, proposing an inelegant Murder on the Orient Express hypothesis of mass extinction that implicates the entire suite of killers. A new study , though, claims to pinpoint the primary killer from this murderers\u2019 row: Among the slew of Very Bad Things implicated in the worst calamity the Earth has ever known, it was the global-warming-driven ocean anoxia that stands out as the primary agent of Armageddon. And in this reaper of the Paleozoic, the study\u2019s authors see a future menace. \u201cI think this study shows the end of the road that we\u2019re heading down,\u201d says the lead author, Justin Penn of the University of Washington, about our modern, warming, and increasingly suffocating oceans. As we\u2019ve known since the 1860s, carbon dioxide is a very important greenhouse gas, and if you increase the amount of it in the atmosphere, it makes the planet warmer. At the end of the Permian, the volcanoes of Siberia, by burning through a giant basin filled with coal and other carbon-rich rocks, emitted enough carbon dioxide to warm the planet by a sweltering 10 degrees Celsius or so. Coincidentally, this is about the same magnitude of warming predicted for humanity in a modern burn-it-all scenario. \u201cIf we are truly the stupidest intelligent species ever, we probably could do the same thing,\u201d says Curtis Deutsch, a co-author on the study. \u201cAs it is, we\u2019re headed toward 3 to 4 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, which is nothing to sniff at. But 10 degrees isn\u2019t that off the charts.\u201d As the world warmed 10 degrees more than 250 million years ago, up to 96 percent of species in the ocean went extinct (for comparison, roughly zero percent of modern species in the ocean have gone extinct so far in what\u2019s been called \u201cthe sixth extinction\u201d). For all the planet knew, it was time for complex life to close up shop after a nice quarter-billion-year run. After several millennia of eruptions from the Siberian Traps, the fossil record remained startlingly impoverished for almost 10 million years, before limply convalescing in the ensuing Triassic period. Read: Earth is not in the midst of a sixth mass extinction. To tease out what was primarily responsible for all this death in the oceans\u2014in this, \u201cthe Great Dying\u201d\u2014Penn and his colleagues developed a climate model, not dissimilar to those used to project future warming on our own modern world. Only in Penn\u2019s model, the continents were reunited. This was Pangaea, the mythic supercontinent that reached its apotheosis in the Permian period, joining Morocco with New Jersey and India with Antarctica. Then the team lit this ancient world on fire. By jacking up the CO2 in their model high enough, Penn and his colleagues were able to re-create the scorching temperatures of the end-Permian mass extinction, searing their ancient climate model maps in worrying shades of red. The flip side of a hot ocean is one with less oxygen, and it has long been known that the oceans of the end-Permian were gasping for the stuff. This paleoceanographic fact has been uncovered by geologists who have found the sickly presence of laminated, pyrite-rich ocean rocks in end-Permian rock outcrops around the word\u2014from the Salt Range in Pakistan to the old whaling redoubt of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean. Even subtler, uranium isotopes in rocks from the catastrophe whisper dark rumors about the asphyxiation of the entire ancient ocean. By driving up the temperature in his model, Penn re-created this end-Permian oxygen loss as well. This is because oxygen is less soluble in hot water, so heat alone can cause oxygen to plummet in the ocean. But a hotter ocean is also a more sluggish and stratified one, so the depths become starved of oxygen\u2019s delivery as well. Even worse, the hotter it gets, the more oxygen animals need to power their metabolism, so hot water quickly creates a crisis of supply and demand. By populating his model ancient ocean with modern creatures, such as sharks and crabs and corals\u2014creatures with a variety of tolerances to things like deoxygenation, temperature, and pH\u2014and then letting all climate hell break loose, Penn found that it was the heat-driven loss of oxygen in the ocean, more than any other factor, that could explain the end of the world. While essentially nothing was spared in this mass extinction, it appears from the fossil record that life at the poles was especially marked for destruction. And this makes sense in a world losing its oxygen. There\u2019s more oxygen in colder waters at the poles, so the creatures there have adapted to it\u2014and are especially sensitive to its diminishment. Meanwhile, tropical creatures are adapted to warmer, more oxygen-poor waters. So if anyone is to survive on a world that\u2019s about to become outrageously hot and lose three-quarters of its oxygen, it will be those hardy inhabitants of the low latitudes. And that\u2019s what\u2019s seen in the fossil record. The tropics still faced an unthinkable cataclysm, but they fared mildly better. The predicament for polar creatures was not unlike those luckless creatures that today inhabit the tops of mountains , and that will have no higher altitude to which to escape in the coming decades. \u201cThey\u2019re shit out of luck,\u201d Deutsch says. Read: The chilling regularity of mass extinctions When the ocean loses its oxygen, it\u2019s something of a great leveler compared with other hypothesized mass-extinction mechanisms. Ocean acidification, for instance (what happens when too much CO2 reacts with seawater), has previously been proposed as the great killer of the end-Permian. But while acidification can have a surprisingly variable effect on the survival of different kinds of sea life, there is hardly any selectivity at all when oxygen disappears from an ecosystem. Everyone dies, matching the near-universal signal of slaughter in the ancient ocean. \u201cThis study suggests we should be worrying much more about hypoxia than about ocean acidification,\u201d Deutsch says. \u201cThere\u2019s vastly more resources being put into [studying] organisms\u2019 responses to pH in seawater than there is into understanding temperature-dependent hypoxia. I think that the field has basically allocated those resources in exactly the wrong way.\u201d The modern oceans have already lost 2 percent of their oxygen since 1960, a remarkable loss driven mostly by coastal nutrient pollution and global warming. It\u2019s an environmental problem that promises to worsen in the warmer world of the coming centuries, just like it did in the end-Permian. And if Earth\u2019s past is any indication of its future, this asphyxiation could be truly world changing. The prospect has led dozens of paleoclimatologists, geochemists, and oceanographers to sign the Kiel Declaration on Ocean Deoxygenation , developed this September to raise global awareness of a problem with increasingly worrying geological precedent. \u201cThis study shows that we\u2019re on that same road toward extinction, and the question is how far down it we go,\u201d Penn says. To head off warming and drastic deoxygenation of the oceans, humanity can either stop burning fossil fuels or artificially dim the amount of sunlight reaching Earth\u2019s surface\u2014a kludgy solution that goes by the name of geoengineering . One of the most hotly debated methods of geoengineering would involve shooting sulfate aerosols out of planes and into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. Unfortunately, says the City College of New York geoscientist Benjamin Black, the end-Permian mass extinction represents something of a proof of concept for the idea, and it\u2019s not pretty. In a paper published last week in Nature Geoscience , Black and his co-authors describe not only the extreme warming of the climate around 252 million years ago, but also the extreme climate whiplashes that throttled the planet on much shorter timescales. These environmental seesaws, the researchers show, were induced by volcanic sulfur dioxide from the Siberian Traps, which would have briefly cooled the planet and masked the warming before being rained out of the atmosphere and allowing the planet to jump back into the high-CO2 inferno. Similarly, if humans embark on a geoengineering project of shooting sulfur dioxide into the air to head off all of the problems of warming, without drastically reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere\u2014and if they ever give up on this project after it starts, for whatever reason, at any time in the next few thousand years\u2014Black can imagine a similar disaster unfolding. \u201cSo if you think about the Siberian Traps and the end-Permian mass extinction as a feasibility study for global warming and sulfur geoengineering, the results of that study were \u2026 not the best,\u201d he said, referring to, quite literally, the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened. \u201cIt\u2019s worth asking ourselves whether we really want to make our current predicament even more like the end-Permian mass extinction.\u201d","headline":"When a Killer Climate Catastrophe Struck the World's Oceans","article_name":577537.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/12\/oxygen-loss-during-mass-extinction\/577537\/","date_published":"2018-12-06 19:45:05","article_length":10667,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:36.584833","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/12\/oxygen-loss-during-mass-extinction\/577537\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"And what they have to do with climate change. This is an excerpt from The Atlantic \u2019s climate newsletter, The Weekly Planet. Subscribe today . The climate scientist Ken Caldeira recently tweeted a joke meant to charm carbon-tax advocates. \u201cIf we don't want people to drink so much alcohol, rather than taxing alcohol, we can subsidize everything that is not alcohol,\u201d he wrote . His point, if I may ruin the punch line, is that the United States\u2019 approach to combatting climate change is kind of silly. It relies far more on subsidizing renewables and other zero-carbon sources than on penalizing fossil fuels, which is what we really care about in the first place. We should just tax carbon pollution . I think this comparison\u2014between carbon taxes and alcohol taxes\u2014is a surprisingly instructive one. That\u2019s because, to start, alcohol taxes work . Fifty years of studies show that as the price of alcohol increases, the societal problems associated with alcohol decrease. But it\u2019s also instructive because, well, consider the history of alcohol taxes. The first time that Congress tried raising taxes on alcohol, Americans staged a violent insurrection that had to be forcibly subdued by, literally, George Washington. When carbon-tax advocates point to the history of alcohol taxes, I do not think that this is the anecdote they have in mind. Yet it\u2019s worth sitting with this history for a moment and seeing what we can learn for climate policy. In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury secretary, advised Washington and Congress to pass an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton\u2019s goals were more modest than those of modern carbon-tax advocates: He didn\u2019t want to reduce booze consumption at all; he just needed an easy source of revenue to pay off the country\u2019s Revolutionary War debts. The tax seemed popular at first with business and financial elites. But by 1794, it was violently opposed by small commodity producers, especially in western Pennsylvania\u2014doesn\u2019t that sound familiar? \u2014who distilled their own spirits at home and relied on the growing whiskey business for their livelihood. When more than 400 men attacked the home of a tax collector, something had to be done. Washington rode in with 13,000 men and peaceably put down the rebellion. The political repercussions continued, however. The backlash helped spark the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party and, with it, the first U.S. party system. The tax remained unpopular until 1802, when President Thomas Jefferson repealed it. Alcohol was arguably as essential to the early American republic as fossil fuels are to our way of life today. In the 1790s, the average American adult drank the equivalent of more than five gallons of 200-proof alcohol a year. Whiskey was used as a medium of exchange in the frontier. By 1830, the average American adult drank the equivalent of seven gallons of 200-proof alcohol annually. Seven gallons. That was as high as consumption ever got\u2014but what reduced alcohol\u2019s use was not a tax. It was economic expansion paired with a social movement. A new religious crusade, the temperance movement, stigmatized alcohol consumption and public drunkenness, framing them as sins. \u201cYou could say [the temperance movement is] the practice-round for nearly every other activist movement that would follow in American history,\u201d Jon Grinspan, a curator at the National Museum of American History, told me in an email. Americans also started substituting one licit drug for another: From the 1820s to the 1850s, tea and coffee consumption more than doubled. What followed was a historic drop in booze consumption. By the 1850s, the average American adult drank less than two gallons a year. When the Civil War broke out a decade later, Congress desperately needed revenue and passed a new excise tax on alcohol. (It helped that many of the same religious moralists who had led the temperance movement now participated in the antislavery Republican Party.) As the war ended, the tax remained\u2014and became essential. By the turn of the 20th century, the alcohol tax generated more than 30 percent of federal revenues every year. (In 1913, when Congress imposed the modern income tax, its share fell to 10 percent .) Read: America has a drinking problem This history is important, I think, because it shows that even in a case where America implemented an economically rational policy, we didn\u2019t adopt it by a particularly rational process. In 1790, the government could not impose an alcohol tax without facing rebellion; by 1890, the government depended on an alcohol tax for a large share of its revenues. The politics that made that change possible stemmed from, first, a campaign led by one of the country\u2019s earliest activist movements and, second, the greater availability of alcohol substitutes such as coffee and tea. Even then, temperance activists later tried to pass their favored policy, a supply-side ban on the production, transportation, and sale of alcohol that we call Prohibition. These two preconditions seem more important when considered for fossil fuels, which furnish most primary energy in our industrial society. The U.S. might one day adopt a carbon tax. But cheap substitutes to fossil fuels seem likely to come first\u2014and a policy that focuses on securing them as options shouldn\u2019t be rejected on the merits.","headline":"Why I\u2019m Thinking About Alcohol Taxes","article_name":620071.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/09\/what-alcohol-taxes-have-do-climate-change-policy\/620071\/","date_published":"2021-09-14 18:10:23","article_length":5334,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:36.606808","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/09\/what-alcohol-taxes-have-do-climate-change-policy\/620071\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Most registered voters are in favor of spending trillions on weatherized buildings and renewable-energy infrastructure. For the first time in years\u2014and maybe ever\u2014Democrats are getting ambitious about climate change. Several presidential candidates have proposed $1 trillion plans that variously nudge, cajole, and force the economy to reduce carbon pollution. The largest plan, from Senator Bernie Sanders, calls for $16.3 trillion in public investment over 10 years, which would be the biggest economic stimulus package since the New Deal. These plans confront a confusing array of public views. Voters are more worried about climate change than ever before, but they also seem to dislike the Democratic Party\u2019s move to the left. So how do voters feel about this new set of progressive policies? A new survey finds: They like it. At least five aggressive and left-wing climate policies are supported by most registered voters in the United States. Americans seem particularly fond of large spending packages, as Sanders has advanced , and climate policies with a populist bent, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposed climate import fee and her \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d plan. The poll was conducted by YouGov Blue and Data for Progress, a liberal think tank. While I try to avoid explicitly ideological surveys, I trust this data because YouGov is a reputable, nonpartisan firm that also conducts polls for CBS News and The Economist . Leah Stokes , a political scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, also told me that the poll\u2019s findings are in line with other research. \u201cClimate policy is very popular,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you highlight the cost, it\u2019s less popular. If you highlight new taxes, it\u2019s less popular. But if you highlight job creation or the air-pollution benefits, it\u2019s more popular.\u201d She added that many climate policies are especially favored now because the public tends to take views opposite those of the sitting president, a concept known as thermostatic public opinion . \u201cWith Trump being president, you\u2019re going to find people want more environmental protection now than when Obama was in power,\u201d she said. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change These results also align with those of conservative-leaning surveys. The American Action Network, an advocacy group tied to the House GOP, recently asked Americans in 30 congressional districts\u2014including 12 \u201cbattleground\u201d districts and 10 Donald Trump\u2013supporting districts\u2014if they liked the idea of a Green New Deal that would move the United States \u201cfrom an economy built on fossil fuels to one driven by clean energy.\u201d Shockingly, the idea was more popular than not , with 48 percent of respondents in support and 7 percent undecided. Only when pollsters told people that a Green New Deal could cost $93 trillion did support for the idea collapse. But according to the GOP group\u2019s own math , a Green New Deal that focused only on climate change could cost only $13 trillion. Results from the new YouGov Blue\/Data for Progress poll find majority support for spending along those lines, though the poll never uses the term Green New Deal . Here are the five climate policies with the most support: 1. A national recycling program for commodities During World War II, the federal government encouraged Americans to save and pool commodities\u2014including paper, steel, and rubber\u2014so that they could be recycled and turned into new ships, planes, and guns. Sanders proposes launching a similar program today for clean energy. It would seek to reduce the cost and blunt the environmental impact of the huge build-out of wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries that he proposes. The idea is overwhelmingly popular, with 64 percent of registered voters in support and only 16 percent opposed. Americans of every race, age, and religion overwhelmingly support the idea. So do six in 10 white men, and a majority of self-described born-again Christians. 2. $1.3 trillion to weatherize every home and office building in the United States At least three different Democratic climate plans \u2014proposed by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Governor Jay Inslee (whose plan has been largely adopted by Warren), and Sanders\u2014have promised to boost federal spending on weatherizing homes and buildings. Sanders\u2019s plan calls for more than $2 trillion in grants to help families improve their home\u2019s energy efficiency. The idea is very popular. Six in 10 voters support spending more than $1 trillion \u201cto weatherize homes and buildings to make them more energy-efficient and reduce energy bills.\u201d A smaller majority of voters older than 65 also support the proposal. 3. $1.5 trillion for a massive federal build-out of renewable energy Sanders promises to build out enough wind, solar, and geothermal energy to power every home and business in the United States by 2030. Such a plan would cost $1.5 trillion, he says, and it would be possible to execute under the existing legal powers of the Energy Department. While the poll didn\u2019t ask Americans if they would support that legal maneuver, a large majority of voters said they were ready to foot the bill for the plan. Fifty-nine percent of respondents said they would strongly or somewhat support $1.5 trillion in federal spending to build out renewables. Among white voters without a college degree\u2014 a group that normally breaks Republican \u2014the idea found 52 percent in support. 4. A climate adjustment fee on environmentally destructive imports Warren has proposed imposing a \u201cborder carbon adjustment\u201d on imports that require high levels of carbon emissions. This policy could help American climate policy from \u201coffshoring\u201d carbon pollution into China and India, supporters say, and it would encourage American cement- and steelmakers to invest in greener ways to make their products. For now, at least, Americans love the idea. Sixty percent of respondents strongly or somewhat supported the idea, while only 23 percent opposed it. (About one in five Americans still aren\u2019t sure what to think.) Read: Why Greta Thunberg makes adults uncomfortable But among working-class voters, the idea was one of the most popular proposed. Fifty-five percent of people without a college degree liked the idea, a level of support that did not change across white and nonwhite respondents. Voters from families making less than $60,000 a year also supported the idea at about that level. 5. \u201cEconomic Nationalism for Climate Change\u201d This summer, Warren announced her plan for \u201ceconomic patriotism,\u201d a policy agenda that actively aims to boost American jobs and industry. Its first plank is a green-manufacturing scheme that pledges $2 trillion over the next 10 years. In short, Warren seeks to revive industrial policy . This poll asked about \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d which it described as a plan to \u201caggressively encourage large American manufacturing firms to specialize in solar panels, wind turbines, and other climate-friendly technologies.\u201d The proposal commanded majority support, with 53 percent overall in support and 30 percent in opposition. It also won a majority of voters who said they lived in a suburb or rural area. Among white voters without a college degree, the idea was above water at 46 percent and an eight-point support gap. But 15 percent of that group said they weren\u2019t sure what to think of the proposal. That may suggest that the group could reject it overall if Republican leaders turn against it. Or perhaps not: Among deeply Republican segments of the electorate\u2014such as white, self-identified born-again Christians\u2014the idea is already 20 points underwater. Not every idea was so popular. Sanders has proposed to fund his $16.3 trillion Green New Deal \u201cby imposing new taxes, fees, and lawsuits on fossil-fuel companies.\u201d Forty-three percent of voters approved that idea, making it more popular than unpopular. But nearly a third of respondents \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d it, suggesting that any backlash could be widely and deeply felt. Stokes wondered if voters were responding primarily to the \u201ctaxes\u201d line in Sanders\u2019s pitch. In a recent poll she ran with other researchers, funding climate policy through lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies was one of the most popular options. Electric-vehicle policy seems particularly tricky. In his plan, Sanders proposes a $2 trillion grant program for low- and middle-income families to buy new electric cars. Yet nearly half of voters oppose that idea outright. A majority of voters also reject Sanders\u2019s proposal to end the sale of gas-burning cars by 2030. That plan attracts the special ire of white voters, 42 percent of whom \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d it. Warren, Senator Kamala Harris, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg have all proposed similarly timed bans . The only other proposal opposed by a majority of voters was a plan to nationalize and shut down fossil-fuel companies such as Exxon while making sure workers \u201claid off by this closure would be fairly compensated.\u201d No Democratic candidate has supported this idea, but it is a goal of some activists and researchers on the American far left. Finally, YouGov and Data for Progress polled the popularity of a carbon tax of $100 a ton. Carbon prices are widely seen as a possible centrist solution to climate change. They win the support of most mainstream economists. As such, there is plenty of good polling on them. It shows that a majority of Americans often , but not always , support the general idea of a carbon price. But this poll aimed to explore more radical policies, so it asked about a $100-a-ton carbon price. This is very, very high. Only two countries, Sweden and Switzerland, levy carbon taxes of at least $100 a ton. In the United States, state-level carbon prices range from $5 to $15 a ton . The Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan advocacy group backed by major oil companies , endorses a federal carbon price of $40 a ton. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report Yet such a high price may find some support in climate science. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that carbon prices might need to start at $135 a ton \u2014and then keep rising\u2014to keep global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. But there isn\u2019t yet public support for that kind of policy. Nearly half of voters, 47 percent, oppose such a high price, according to the poll. The 38 percent of voters who support the policy in any way is only moderately larger than the 33 percent of voters who say they \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d it. The one bright spot for supporters: About 15 percent of respondents were not sure. All respondents were told that the $100 carbon tax could increase gas prices by about 88 cents a gallon, an estimate based on data from Resources for the Future , a nonpartisan think tank.","headline":"Five Radical Climate Policies That Most Americans Actually Like","article_name":599272.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/10\/5-most-popular-radical-climate-policies\/599272\/","date_published":"2019-10-07 18:30:07","article_length":10772,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:38.481220","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/10\/5-most-popular-radical-climate-policies\/599272\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Environmental movements have shifted public awareness about climate change. How many more people will need to join them for their demands to be met? Although world leaders were gathered in Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference last week, Greta Thunberg said change wouldn\u2019t be coming from within the summit\u2019s halls. \u201cThat is not leadership\u2014 this is leadership,\u201d Thunberg said of, and to, her fellow activists. \u201cThis is what leadership looks like.\u201d The way many environmental campaigners, including Thunberg, see it, they are the ones who helped create the space for governments to take more decisive action on climate change\u2014an issue that has attracted growing levels of concern across the world\u2019s advanced economies , including from a majority of people in the United States . Through protests, school strikes, and other nonviolent actions, they have been credited with raising public awareness about the seriousness of the climate crisis, and the need for governments to solve it. Yet despite these efforts, many climate activists I spoke with recently lamented that COP26 was failing to meet the urgency of the moment. A major question facing today\u2019s climate movement is what critical mass is required to compel governments to take its demands more seriously. If millions of people aren\u2019t enough to pressure leaders to take drastic and enforceable action on climate change, how many are? And what will it take for others to be moved to join them? There isn\u2019t a magic figure guaranteed to tip the balance in favor of widespread climate mitigation, of course. But some environmental campaigners have worked with a particular number in mind: 3.5 percent . This comes from the work of the political scientist Erica Chenoweth, whose research found that nonviolent movements require the active participation of at least 3.5 percent of a population in order to achieve serious political change. This so-called 3.5 percent rule was derived from Chenoweth\u2019s study of hundreds of protests from 1900 to 2006, and has made an impact on contemporary movements, including Extinction Rebellion, an international climate-advocacy group based in London whose founders cite Chenoweth as a source of inspiration (the group publicly states that it needs the involvement of 2 million people, or roughly 3.5 percent of the British population, in order to succeed). When I interviewed Chenoweth last year , they explained their findings in a more matter-of-fact way: Nonviolent protests are more successful than their violent counterparts because they are better at eliciting broad and diverse support from the societies in which they take place. This makes these movements more inclusive, and also more innovative. These kinds of protests don\u2019t necessarily succeed because they appeal to the morality of those in power, but rather because they effectively constrain a government\u2019s options by undermining its support in various pillars of society, such as bureaucrats, the media, and business elites. If 3.5 percent of a country\u2019s\u2014or the world\u2019s\u2014population backs any one issue or policy proposal, that is a substantial enough voting bloc, consumer market, and workforce to get those in power to pay attention. The climate movement has already demonstrated this kind of influence. Fridays for Future, which was started by Thunberg in 2018 as a solitary school strike in protest of climate inaction, has since attracted millions of participants around the world and earned Thunberg an international platform , as well as high-profile meetings with world leaders and global institutions. In Britain, Extinction Rebellion has been credited with influencing Parliament\u2019s 2019 decision to declare a climate emergency and commit to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, making the country the first major economy to do so. In the United States, the youth-led Sunrise Movement has been widely recognized for its role in elevating the climate crisis on the national agenda. But with few exceptions , none of these efforts has been able to surpass the 3.5 percent threshold. Part of the challenge comes down to the fact that many of these movements were stymied by the pandemic , which forced them online. Others have been vilified for their more disruptive tactics: Extinction Rebellion, as well as its U.K.-focused offshoot, Insulate Britain, has become notorious for its commitment to civil disobedience, which has at times involved blocking bridges, freeways, and public transport. A recent poll found that less than 20 percent of Britons have a positive view of Extinction Rebellion. Insulate Britain, which has been on the receiving end of negative press over its recent spate of road blockages, has also seen a decline in public support. The way many within these movements see it, their goal isn\u2019t to inconvenience people; it\u2019s to help raise awareness about the seriousness of the challenge we are all facing, and to be just disruptive enough to compel those in power to act. \u201cMost of the people in [Extinction Rebellion] and other climate activists don\u2019t actually want to be doing this,\u201d Christina See, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson in New York City, told me of the recent road closures . \u201cBut we\u2019re also looking at the future and saying, \u2018Okay, what is our future going to be like unless we fight for action now?\u2019\u201d Read: We\u2019re heading straight for a demi-Armageddon In many ways, this argument makes sense. The inconvenience posed by these groups pales in comparison with the kind of disruption that awaits if the climate crisis is left unresolved. Some of the more extreme weather events fueled by climate change, including flash floods , wildfires , and heat waves , are already being experienced. Not only is climate science on climate activists\u2019 side, but they also feel that history is too. \u201cThe suffragettes were vilified,\u201d Tracey Mallaghan, a spokesperson for Insulate Britain, told me, in reference to the more violent arm of Britain\u2019s suffragist movement. \u201cIf you look back at history, it\u2019s always been a small percentage of the population fighting until it changes. And then everybody agrees that it was always that way and should have been done.\u201d But unlike their historical counterparts, climate activists don\u2019t have the luxury of time. For this reason, environmental campaigners such as Rupert Read have been calling for the formation of a \u201c moderate flank \u201d\u2014one that he believes can attract a broader base of public support and, in turn, accelerate the movement\u2019s aims. It\u2019s not that Read is averse to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s civil disobedience\u2014in fact, we spoke the day after a hearing in his trial , in which he has been charged with criminal damage for his participation in an Extinction Rebellion protest last year. But he believes that in order for it and other like-minded movements to be successful, they need to galvanize those who wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to engage in civil disobedience. When I asked Read what this moderate flank would look like, he told me that some iterations of it already exist, in the form of workplace-oriented groups such as Lawyers for Net Zero and Parents for Future, a network inspired by Thunberg\u2019s movement. These kinds of organizations can help bring the climate movement closer to the 3.5 percent prescribed by Chenoweth, but Read said he doesn\u2019t think even that will be enough to achieve the kind of drastic societal change that environmental campaigners are agitating for. \u201cYou need to have a large body of people who are going to be actively in support, and an even larger body of people who are going to be willing to make the kinds of changes that you\u2019re after,\u201d Read said. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason why \u2026 we have to be careful about overly polarizing strategies.\u201d  While they may differ on tactics, if all climate campaigners can agree on one thing, it\u2019s that \u201cvolume matters,\u201d Clare Farrell, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, told me, noting that even if COP26 fails, it could at the very least motivate more people to get involved, however they choose to. \u201cThat\u2019s the message that I hope people are going to get after the COP: Nobody\u2019s coming to save us.\u201d Read: When the climate crisis becomes unignorable Numbers aren\u2019t the sole way of measuring impact. Dana Fisher, an environmental-activism expert at the University of Maryland and a contributor to a forthcoming report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told me that \u201cin terms of reducing CO 2 emissions, there\u2019s extremely little literature that shows that movements have had any effect.\u201d Though she believes this can change, Fisher said it will probably take more time, and more extreme weather events, before there is enough political will to make the kind of tangible impact required. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to be Australia burning; it\u2019s not just going to be the Pacific Northwest burning,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see even more drastic effects of climate change to get people to realize that COVID was nothing compared to what we\u2019re facing.\u201d","headline":"Can 3.5 Percent Save the Planet?","article_name":620641.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2021\/11\/cop26-climate-activism\/620641\/","date_published":"2021-11-08 11:00:00","article_length":9003,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:39.739968","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2021\/11\/cop26-climate-activism\/620641\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Wishful thinking hampers the clean-energy revolution. Since the 1960s, fighting for the environment has frequently meant fighting against corporations. To curb pollution, activists have worked to thwart new oil drilling , coal-fired power plants, fracking for natural gas , and fuel pipelines. But today, Americans face a climate challenge that can\u2019t be solved by just saying no again and again. Decarbonizing the economy will require an unprecedented amount of new energy investment. Fossil-fuel infrastructure built over centuries needs to be replaced within the next few decades by clean-energy alternatives. The United States will need to build hundreds of thousands of square miles of wind and solar farms; deploy enough battery storage to keep power flowing through the grid even on calm, cloudy days; and at least double the country\u2019s transmission-line capacity. And the same laws that environmental groups leveraged in the past to block or delay fossil-fuel projects are now being exploited by NIMBYs in ways that, however well intended, will slow the country\u2019s transition to clean energy. Windmills off Cape Cod , a geothermal facility in Nevada , and what could have been the largest solar farm in America have all been blocked by an endless series of environmental reviews and lawsuits. The good news is that, with reasonable reforms, the energy transition is fully within reach. Private investment in clean-energy technology is skyrocketing, and even Big Oil is starting to realize there is no future in fossil fuels. Conor Friedersdorf: The environmental laws hindering clean energy But this may not be enough for some environmentalists. Jamie Henn, an environmental activist and the director of Fossil Free Media, recently told  Rolling Stone , \u201cLook, I want to get carbon out of the atmosphere, but this is such an opportunity to remake our society. But if we just perpetuate the same harms in a clean-energy economy, and it\u2019s just a world of Exxons and Elon Musks\u2014oh, man, what a nightmare.\u201d Many progressive commentators similarly believe that countering climate change requires a fundamental reordering of the West\u2019s political and economic systems. \u201cThe level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below \u2018absolutely catastrophic\u2019 is fundamentally, on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo,\u201d the writer Phil McDuff has argued . The climate crisis, the Green New Deal advocate Naomi Klein has insisted , \u201ccould be the best argument progressives have ever had\u201d to roll back corporate influence, tear up free-trade deals, and reinvest in public services and infrastructure. Such comments raise a question: What is the real goal here\u2014stopping climate change or abolishing capitalism? Taking climate change seriously as a global emergency requires an all-hands-on-deck attitude and a recognition that technological solutions (yes, often built and deployed by private firms) can deliver real progress on decarbonization before the proletariat has seized the means of production. A massive infusion of private investment, made not for charity but in the anticipation of future profits, is precisely what\u2019s needed to accelerate the clean-energy transition\u2014which, like all revolutions, will yield unpredictable results. The belief that top-down decision makers can choreograph precisely how the clean-energy revolution will proceed runs deep in progressive circles. In the manifesto describing his version of the Green New Deal, Bernie Sanders declared , \u201cTo get to our goal of 100 percent sustainable energy, we will not rely on any false solutions like nuclear, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, or trash incinerators.\u201d Many environmental groups share the Vermont senator\u2019s aversion to these technologies. But the climate emergency demands we take a closer look at some of them before writing them off completely. In the face of uncertainty about the best path to decarbonization, policy makers should think like a venture capitalist\u2014placing lots of bets in the expectation that some technologies will fail but the investment portfolio will succeed as a whole. The \u201cfalse solutions\u201d that Sanders decries may indeed prove unworkable. Nuclear energy might never be cost-competitive, and geoengineering may prove technically infeasible. But we can\u2019t know in advance. Environmental activists have historically been skeptical of nuclear energy, but that attitude may be changing . California reversed its decision to shut down the Diablo Canyon plant, and Japan announced plans to start investing in nuclear energy again\u2014an outcome few predicted after Fukushima. This is welcome news, considering that, per unit of electricity produced, nuclear energy causes fewer deaths than wind energy and creates fewer carbon emissions than solar (and concerns about waste are overblown ). However, one major barrier to deployment remains: Unlike solar and wind, which have seen dramatic cost decreases , nuclear-power-plant construction costs have actually increased over time. Although that means the current generation of nuclear technology isn\u2019t likely to be a major climate tool, advanced nuclear systems such as small modular reactors show considerable promise. The potential climate benefits from cost-effective nuclear fission or even nuclear fusion are so large that they\u2019re worth some strategic bets \u2014even at long odds. Some forms of geoengineering, such as carbon-dioxide removal, would require massive reductions in cost to be viable as a climate solution. But the same was true of solar and wind decades ago, and the government was able to accelerate the learning curve in those fields by being an early source of demand and reducing the direct costs for consumers. Many progressive environmentalists feel uneasy with technologies that blunt the climate impact of fossil fuels rather than banish them entirely. And yet we need such options. Some major industries, such as aviation and cement and steel production, will be hard to decarbonize, and we\u2019re already likely to overshoot the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius greater than preindustrial levels. The only way to permanently reverse that warming will be to suck carbon directly out of the atmosphere. More traditional carbon capture and sequestration methods, designed to capture greenhouse gases as they\u2019re generated at large pollution sources, are showing less promise than carbon-dioxide removal given that they typically leave some residual emissions, but they\u2019re still certainly better than unmitigated fossil-fuel use. In a variety of other ways, Americans will have to choose between the perfect and the good. Some environmentalists are skeptical of geothermal energy, which requires extensive drilling. Yet it has high potential as a source of clean baseload power with a small geographical footprint that can, in theory, be deployed anywhere in the world (if you drill deep enough). One way to accelerate investment in geothermal energy would be to give this clean technology the same expedited permitting that oil and gas companies already receive for leases on federal land. M. Nolan Gray: How Californians are weaponizing environmental law Yet permitting reform requires loosening regulations and laws that many environmentalists hold dear. The National Environmental Policy Act requires reviews that give enormous power to anyone who wants to block or delay a proposed energy project, either out of genuine social concern or for self-interested reasons. In practice, it is a major bottleneck to building clean-energy infrastructure. According to an analysis of government data by the R Street Institute , 65 percent of the energy projects categorized as either \u201cin progress\u201d or \u201cplanned\u201d are related to renewable energy, and 16 percent have to do with electricity transmission. And nearly 20 times as much offshore wind power is held up in permitting as is currently in operation or under construction. U.S. climate spending could exceed more than half a trillion dollars by the end of this decade\u2014but without permitting reform, those investments won\u2019t translate into much physical infrastructure. A new permitting-reform measure put forth by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has drawn criticism for fast-tracking some specific fossil-fuel projects, such as the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline, but in general clean-energy infrastructure has much more to gain relative to fossil fuels by streamlining permitting, because so much of it still needs to be built. None of this means that the United States should let the energy market run wild. On the contrary, the federal government will need to use a heavy hand in ensuring that technologies like carbon-dioxide removal actually deliver on their claims (unlike carbon offsets\u2014a sketchy market rife with fraud and greenwashing). And public investment in clean technologies has already been pivotal in driving down the costs of solar and wind power as well as batteries. Yet we cannot succeed in the fight against global warming without giving many alternatives to the status quo an opportunity to evolve and prove themselves. In reality, the false solution to climate change isn\u2019t geoengineering or nuclear energy\u2014it\u2019s the belief that we can decarbonize the economy only by upending our economic system, categorically rejecting certain technologies, and spurning private investment.","headline":"What Many Progressives Misunderstand About Fighting Climate Change","article_name":671545.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/09\/capitalism-clean-energy-technology-permitting\/671545\/","date_published":"2022-09-25 10:30:00","article_length":9389,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:40.505351","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/09\/capitalism-clean-energy-technology-permitting\/671545\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Environmental differences that show up in fungi might give researchers a glimpse of climate shifts that have only just begun. The mushroom Amanita thiersii dots American lawns from Texas to Illinois, a small white button on the grass\u2019s emerald expanse. Unlike similar mushrooms, A. thiersii does not live in a symbiotic relationship with nearby trees; instead, it gets its energy by feasting on the corpses of its neighbors\u2014that is, dead grasses. That predilection means that the mushroom is uniquely suited to report on what those grasses were like before they perished, according to a new paper in Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences . In fact, an analysis of 40-odd A. thiersii samples taken from lawns across the Midwest over 27 years suggests that the mushrooms, as a result of the grasses they eat, may be able reflect the changing climate of the last few decades in their chemistry. The reason it might be possible to trace climate change in grass at all is because plants can be distinguished by the different ways they handle photosynthesis. The new paper looks at two methods of photosynthesis in particular: C3 and C4, named after the structure of the molecules the methods produce. The majority of plant species perform C3, which produces energy at higher concentrations of CO2 and at lower temperatures. C4 plants, meanwhile\u2014most of which evolved in hotter and drier climates\u2014are more efficient in higher temperatures, but too much CO2 is hard for them to deal with. Lawn grasses in the U.S., as it happens, can include both C3 and C4 plants. Wherever C3 and C4 plants grow together, it\u2019s possible to tell from the chemistry of the soil\u2014which is made up, of course, of decayed plants\u2014what their ratio was in past growing seasons. Using this, scientists have been exploring how temperature and CO2 can affect the competition between the two types. In the new study, the researchers, led by Erik Hobbie, an ecologist at University of New Hampshire, looked to see whether the ratio of carbon isotopes in the lawn mushrooms, picked up from dead grasses, could be explained by climate differences. First, they examined the isotope levels in the samples, which were gathered between 1982 and 2009. \u201cI thought we\u2019d see small shifts in the carbon isotope values,\u201d says Hobbie. \u201cBut we saw these quite dramatic shifts that can only be explained by shifts in the competition between C4 and C3 grasses.\u201d Then, they ran regressions to see how much of the shift could be explained by factors like temperature, rainfall, and CO2. They found that despite the rise in temperatures across that period, the relative contribution of carbon from C3 grasses increased. That was in apparent response to the rise in carbon dioxide concentrations, which C3 grasses are better at handling. It\u2019s intriguing that environmental differences could show up in fungi, because it suggests that researchers interested in the climate change of the very recent past could look to mushroom samples in collections to get a glimpse at changes that have only just begun. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting new proxy,\u201d says Hobbie. \u201cTo me it points to the potential for archived specimens of fungi as integrators of past environmental conditions.\u201d Still, Hobbie wonders whether it\u2019s possible to be more precise about exactly how old the carbon is that these mushrooms are eating, and thus a little more certain about their connection to the grasses and environmental change. \u201cIs it this year\u2019s carbon? Or last year\u2019s? Or the last couple years\u2019? We haven\u2019t done those kinds of measurements yet,\u201d he says. Hobbie notes that people can be carbon-dated, thanks to radiocarbon isotopes in tooth enamel and other human tissues put together after the thermonuclear tests of the mid-20th century. The same should be true of mushroom tissue, with the level of radiocarbon serving as an indicator of the year in which the carbon was assimilated. \u201cThat would be the way I would want to look,\u201d he says.","headline":"Tracking Climate Change Through a Mushroom's Diet ","article_name":528483.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/mushrooms-climate-change\/528483\/","date_published":"2017-05-30 15:28:15","article_length":3968,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:41.286003","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/mushrooms-climate-change\/528483\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"I am upstaged in the gardening department by my own compost pile. All kinds of things take root in it. Two years ago, some member of the squash family -- possibly a cross-pollinated wild hybrid of some kind -- planted its seedling flag atop the steamy, south-facing slope and began to grow. Soon, its stickle-backed leaves were the size of placemats, and they were attached to a stem as thick as a child's wrist. When it started to climb the sides of the bin and spill over the top, blooming wildly with crepe-y orange flowers and shivering with bees, Elijah became so terrified that he bribed Faith into taking over his every-other-night compost-toting duty. Elijah, you are scared of a squash vine? It tried to grab me. I am NOT kidding. Please! You can have all my allowance. When we came home from a camping trip, Elijah ran into the backyard to check on the compost predator. Mom, come and look! It turned into a balloon tree! And so it had. Grabbing hold of a tree trunk next to the bin, the vine had climbed a small maple and entirely covered it. Its flowers had become fruits -- deep green globes, each the size of a party balloon. And so we had squashes -- or something -- dangling above our heads. They tasted good. I saut\u00e9ed them with garlic and basil, grated them up for soup stock, added them to muffins and pasta sauce, and, in one form or another, we ate them all winter. If only my garden were half as prolific. To be sure, I'm mostly slumming when I'm working in it. Because our CSA farm is only a half-mile away -- and its hoop houses, hen houses, and root cellars provide us eggs and produce year-round -- I have the luxury of leaving the serious crop production to the experts and can still carry into my kitchen (via bicycle or sled) locally grown food, burning no carbon to do it. It's likely that your garden will produce a much bigger fraction of your groceries than mine and thus save fossil fuels twice over -- first, in the form of long-distance, refrigerated produce transportation and, second, in local trips to bring the food from market to kitchen. Regardless, the real climate value of the garden lies in three other places. The first is in building skills. If our children are going to grow up in a world of increasing environmental instability and declining oil reserves -- and they are -- it seems useful for them to know a few things about potatoes. The second is in preserving the genetic diversity of seeds. In an unpredictable climate, we need as many varieties of as many fruits, grains, and vegetables as possible -- the drought-resistant ones, the mildew-resistant ones, the early-blooming and late-blooming kinds. Big commercial seed companies are, for the most part, not interested in the rare, the peculiar, and the untruckable. As a result, many traditional varieties are now on the edge of extinction. But gardens can function as living archives of genetic diversity, especially when backyard gardeners become seed savers. With almost no extra effort on your part, your garden can feed your family while also doubling as a gene bank. As I think you can see, this is sounding pretty heroic already: Son, I need your help in the garden today. Our job is to preserve 10,000 years of agrarian heritage. The real carbon savings of gardens, however, comes from the compost, and this is the reason I am issuing a universal recommendation for gardening. Together, food waste and yard trimmings make up 26 percent of the municipal solid waste stream in the United States. And, when buried in landfills, they become fuel for the production of methane, a long-lived gas that is 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, methane is now fully 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions -- and its slice of the emissions pie is growing. Furthermore, of the 13 major sources of methane, the largest single one is landfills. (At 184.3 million metric tons per year, landfills add more methane to the atmosphere than \"enteric fermentation,\" which refers to, well, how the nation's 100 million cattle add methane to the atmosphere.) Rerouting one quarter of the waste stream to compost bins would seriously tamp down the number one source of methane gas emissions. And, because it serves as fertilizer for the garden, compost obviates the need to purchase synthetic fertilizers, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, and which, when used as directed, add a second noxious greenhouse gas to the air: nitrous oxide (whose heat-trapping powers are 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide; it is also a precursor of smog). So, to summarize: By planting a garden, you create the need for compost, and by starting a compost pile, three problems are solved: And the best part of all: The compost pile, nature's Crock-Pot, requires almost no work whatsoever. Within months, dead leaves and old food will, all by themselves, transform into rich, black, loamy (non-smelly) humus. Depending on your perspective, this is either a holy blessing or the result of unpaid labor on the part of earthworms, fungi, and other members of the ecosystem service industry. Depending on how you run your household, you can either send your eight- and five-year-old out to the compost pile on alternate nights, armed with a flashlight and a bucket of food scraps, because come on now, we all have to pitch in around here, or you can pay them. And depending on your relationship to the various food-providing institutions that surround you -- churches, temples, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, restaurants -- you can go public with your newfound skills and make monumental changes. Bates College in Maine composts all of its dining hall food scraps and returns them to the farmers' fields that supply the (organic, local) food that is served there. The city of San Francisco has already instituted mandatory, curbside compost pick-up for urban residents. In short, the large-scale diversion of food scraps from methane-generating landfills is a doable project that awaits no technological breakthrough or venture capital investment. So, go do it.

{"id":null,"body":">In yet another unnerving sign that China may not be on the same page as other major countries combating climate change, its top climate negotiator said there was still uncertainty about the causes of global warming. \"There are still two different viewpoints in the scientific field,\" said Xie Zhenhua, citing human activities and the scientifically scoffed-at sunspot theory . This is not the first time Xie has revealed his skeptical stance. At a meeting in India in January, he made similar comments about the causes of warming and asked the UN's climate panel to conduct further research. Xie does not dispute that the climate is changing, however, and said Wednesday that the consequences of this change are alarming enough that countries should cut emissions anyway. Skepticism from such a key player on the global stage has surprised China's peers. Similar views abound in the U.S. , but they have not infiltrated the diplomatic ranks responsible for negotiating climate change tactics at Copenhagen last December and in Cancun this year. China was not the most popular player in Copenhagen (though neither, admittedly, was the U.S.) and was even accused of \"sabotaging\" the talks. By questioning the science, Xie could be attempting to lay the groundwork for a less stringent global agreement, thus taking the pressure off China's growing, and energy-intensive, industries . Sarah Ladislaw, a senior fellow in energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out that \"a lot of what China is going to do in terms of reductions are things that have co-benefits for them in terms of local pollution and technology growth.\" But denying the existence of climate change and pointing out uncertainties in the science explaining it are two different things, she says. With global attention focused on a review of the UN's climate panel after errors were found in its 2007 report, Ladislaw thinks that Xie's comments \"might be one of those things that gets people's attention, but I wouldn't put too much weight behind them as something that signals a significant shift in China's position.\"","headline":"China's Climate Change Skepticism","article_name":37282.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/03\/chinas-climate-change-skepticism\/37282\/","date_published":"2010-03-10 16:15:23","article_length":2133,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:42.429775","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/03\/chinas-climate-change-skepticism\/37282\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Bernie Sanders released a massive plan for a Green New Deal this week. What\u2019s the point of all these climate plans? It\u2019s a historic week for climate change in the Democratic Party. In the same 12-hour span, Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled his plan to pass a gargantuan $16 trillion Green New Deal as president, while Governor Jay Inslee of Washington\u2014who ran an unprecedented, bluntly climate-focused campaign\u2014dropped out of the 2020 primary. Then, this afternoon, the Democratic National Committee rejected a proposal to hold a climate-centered debate in the primary\u2014even though nearly every candidate had endorsed the idea. The three events left me wondering: How important is climate change, really, in the Democratic Party? The sheer audacity of Sanders\u2019s plan suggests that it is absolutely essential. He proposes eliminating all carbon pollution from the U.S. electricity and transportation sector by 2030. To get there, he calls for the de facto nationalization of the power grid and for massive subsidies for electric cars, among many other new programs. At the same time, his plan lays the groundwork for the entire economy to decarbonize by 2050. These emission cuts are roughly in line with what is needed in order to safely prevent about 5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming on land , according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But they may also be, according to many energy experts and engineers, physically impossible. They would require the United States to undertake an infrastructure build-out on a scale not seen since World War II. And many of the same experts say Sanders has made his task harder by insisting on 100 percent renewable energy nationwide, thereby excluding nuclear power. Read: The plan to fix climate change in the Senate On the other hand: $16.3 trillion is a lot of money. Sanders\u2019s \u201cDecade of the Green New Deal\u201d would be one of the largest peacetime fiscal-stimulus packages in U.S. history. If parceled out evenly across 10 years, his proposed annual injection of $1.6 trillion would exceed the Obama-era Recovery Act both in inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of national output . This does give him a lot of wiggle room. Take the electric-vehicle policy, for instance. Sanders wants $2 trillion in grants to help low- and middle-income families buy electric cars, and he proposes a separate $681 billion program that would give Americans cash for trading in their old gas-powered vehicles. When President Barack Obama implemented the \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d trade-in program in 2009, nearly 700,000 clunkers were traded in, at a cost of $2.85 billion . Sanders\u2019s program is more than 200 times as pricey, but it must apply to nearly all the country\u2019s more than 260 million  registered vehicles. If the United States wants to decarbonize the transportation sector by 2050, it\u2019s going to need some version of some trade-in policy. And the costs of that program, while very high, are almost certainly smaller than what the United States would suffer under runaway climate change. Yet I\u2019m not even sure whether Sanders could pass his Green New Deal even if he became president . Many of his proposals will require the approval and participation of Congress\u2014and right now, Democrats control only the House. Even if Democrats won the Senate, Sanders\u2019s plan would be subject to approval from red-state moderates such as Joe Manchin and Doug Jones. And this isn\u2019t true just of the Sanders plan: Almost every ambitious climate plan released by the Democratic candidates would need an assist from Congress. As I scanned the more than 13,000 words of Sanders\u2019s Green New Deal, I wondered: What\u2019s the point? Why put all of this out there? After all, what matters isn\u2019t what Sanders would like to do as president, but how he would prioritize issues once in the Oval Office. And if he and Senator Elizabeth Warren and everyone else publish audacious plans for every issue, we don\u2019t have much of a clue. Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what\u2019s happening now Jay Inslee, for his part, made his ranking clear. He entered the primary earlier this year swearing to put climate change front and center, and he did. His more than 200 pages of climate proposals are some of the best and most complete I\u2019ve seen anywhere, and they should serve as a blueprint for the next Democratic administration. (True to form, he released his last climate proposal on the day he dropped out.) He mentioned climate change in every debate, he seemed well liked by both moderate and leftist online tastemakers, and he was even deemed hot . For months now, Democratic primary voters have told pollsters that climate change is a top-tier issue, tied with health care for importance. Inslee made that idea central to his campaign. He is an accomplished politician who oversees one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing state economies. As governor, he passed a health-care public option, a long-term-care benefit plan, and\u2014after three failed efforts\u2014 a statewide climate policy . Yet for all that effort, he never cracked 1 percent in the polls . Nate Silver, the editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight, tweeted his verdict: \u201cPeople will try to spin it differently but Inslee\u2019s lackluster performance is an obviously bearish indicator for the prioritization of climate change in Democratic politics.\u201d Yikes. I think that\u2019s going a little too far, but I agree that Inslee\u2019s lack of success does reveal a political problem for climate advocates. For all the plans, climate change does not seem to function in the Democratic Party the way that, say, abortion does within the Republican Party: There isn\u2019t a well-organized contingent of voters waiting to glom on to a climate champion. There is a large, addressable set of voters who care about climate change\u2014but they mostly seem to be activated Democrats, and as activated Democrats, they care about a wide range of issues, and as such retain a wide range of candidate loyalties. Thanks to years of careful organizing, the banner of climate action can unite the U.S. left\u2019s many constituencies . But they come together as constituencies, and that means that even if they want  climate action, it remains only one in a list of demands. In other words, climate change may occupy a position in the party much like Elizabeth Warren does in the primary : Both are just about every Democrat\u2019s second- best  friend. And therein lies the problem. It suggests that if a Democratic politician fails to act aggressively on climate change in office, then no cohort of voters may exist to \u201cpunish\u201d them by abstaining from the next election. And that does augur poorly for the prioritization of climate change. Read: This land is the only land there is Now, I think climate advocates are actually aware of this challenge. Right now, groups such as the Sunrise Movement are trying to overcome it through high-profile organizing and newsworthy protests. And that\u2019s working, somewhat: The Green New Deal is all over the news, primary voters are saying they care about climate change, and\u2014hey\u2014at least nearly every Democrat in the primary has gone out of their way to announce a big, ambitious, full-economy climate plan. And maybe the political rewards for tackling climate change don\u2019t lie within the Democratic coalition. There are signs that climate change is, for many politically jaded young people, a kind of worldview-shaping, pre-political issue. (Just check out all the climate-themed memes and TikToks .) These people aren\u2019t really Democrats, but they\u2019re also definitely not Republicans, and the only elections they may ever turn out for are presidential races. According to Pew data , about one in seven voters ages 18 to 29 voted third party in 2016, far more than any other age group. And an analysis by a student at the University of Pennsylvania found that youth was \u201cthe strongest indicator for \u2018switching\u2019 one\u2019s vote away from Clinton\u201d to a third-party candidate. A Democrat who leaned hard into climate in the general  election may\u2014emphasis here on may \u2014be able to reach some of those voters and narrow the generational turnout gap . At the same time, 40 percent of Millennial Republicans say that humans are causing climate change. Only about half that many of their older co-partisans say the same thing, according to The New York Times . Whether that group\u2014the long-awaited, climate-concerned young Republican\u2014ever demands real climate policy is one of the most high-stakes electoral questions of the next few decades. To reach and retain either group of voters, I suspect the next Democratic president must do more than make legal tweaks to Environmental Protection Agency rules. Instead, they must bend the nation\u2019s progress toward battling climate change. And they must promise something more transformative from the energy transition than millions of jobs or invisible cuts to an invisible pollutant. That\u2019s why the most important prophecy in Sanders\u2019s plan is one I\u2019ve also heard from climate-concerned libertarians: that after we cover the country in new solar panels and wind turbines, electricity will be so cheap for Americans as to practically be free. The morning after he dropped out, Inslee announced he would seek a third term as governor of Washington. A number of journalists tweeted that he would do well as the next Democratic EPA administrator. I disagree. The EPA\u2019s ambit is too narrow, and climate change too sprawling, for Inslee\u2019s time and talents. If the 2020 Democratic nominee, whoever it is, really wants to tackle climate change as their own plan discusses it\u2014as an issue afflicting the whole economy\u2014then they\u2019ll need to show that someone in their administration can tackle it at the whole-economy level. They\u2019ll need to put their money, in other words, where their Medium post is. They could start by calling Jay Inslee. He would make an excellent vice president.","headline":"For Voters, Does Climate \u2026 Actually Even Matter?","article_name":596623.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/does-climate-change-really-matter-2020-democrats\/596623\/","date_published":"2019-08-22 20:32:40","article_length":9877,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:42.849750","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/does-climate-change-really-matter-2020-democrats\/596623\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cThe need to understand strange events like the Carnian Pluvial Episode has taken on new urgency.\" In Italy, the dawn of the greatest empire in the history of the world is marked, not by broken marble pediments strewn across the seven hills of Rome, but modest three-toed footprints pressed into rocks far to the north, high in the Italian Alps. They were left by coastal dinosaurs patrolling the tidal flats of a tropical lagoon over 230 million years ago, and they\u2019re among the earliest in Earth\u2019s history. Perhaps more remarkable, though, than this sudden appearance of dinosaurs in ancient Europe, are the strange rocks which host them. The legendary reptile trackways appear just above crumbling bands of red clay that cut through the cream-colored peaks of the Dolomites\u2014a striking dash in the strata that marks one of the most bizarre climate events ever. Almost a quarter-billion years ago, rains soaked the arid wastes of the supercontinent Pangaea for more than a million years. When the floodwaters retreated, a new world was born. I joined up with paleontologist Massimo Bernardi in Trento, Italy hoping to learn more about this primeval washout, known as the Carnian Pluvial Episode. It was one of the oddest climate events, and most severe biotic crises, in the history of life. We hopped into the museum truck of his Museo Delle Scienze and, before long, were winding through apple orchards that sloped off sun-splashed towers of ivory and rose-tinted dolomite. Here in northern Italy\u2019s Adige Valley you\u2019re as likely to be served strudel as gelato, and traveling from one mountain village to another represents a linguistic island-hop between Italian, German, and even Ladin, an ancient relic of Roman occupation. But among the jagged peaks that carve up this cultural collage, Bernardi was more interested in literal island-hopping between 230-million-year-old tropical atolls that had been thrust toward the stars and draped in snow. Here in the mountains, the bottom of a prehistoric ocean meets the top of the sky, and gondolas hoist skiers up these ancient reef walls like alpine ammonites. In fact, the entire Dolomite region is a playground of exhumed lagoons, shallow seas, and tidal flats, part of a swath of Triassic rocks that extends all the way to Slovenia\u2014lifted into the air ages later by Africa\u2019s languid drift northward. \u201cOf course, they\u2019re just rocks for most people,\u201d said Bernardi about his hometown limestone, which piled up almost 2 miles thick in places, \u201cBut I kind of like trying to be the voice of those rocks.\u201d Bernardi is part of an international group of Carnian Pluvial Episode researchers, trying to reconstruct how this obscure spasm of extreme climate change tucked into the middle of the Triassic period rerouted the trajectory of life on Earth, and\u2014if he\u2019s right\u2014launched the near-eternal age of the dinosaurs. The crisis started with a familiar culprit. Two hundred and thirty-four million years ago, gigantic pulses of carbon dioxide erupted into the atmosphere from volcanoes at the bottom of the ocean\u2014volcanoes whose frozen magma today can be found on the other side of the planet, grafted onto the side of British Columbia. This earthly belch of CO2 drove intense bouts of global warming, ocean acidification, mass extinction, and, most notably, a barrage of extreme rainfall and mountain-flattening mega-monsoons still visible in rocks around the world. In Italy, the episode appears in places as a muddy red mess, many meters thick, that laterally slices through the white ocean rock of the Dolomites. Above and below this incongruous red-clay layer, in the kilometers of classic dolomite that sandwich it, one can find seashells living in what were the former white sands and reefs of a prehistoric Bora Bora\u2013like platform almost 50 miles offshore. But among the surprising red layers of the Carnian Pluvial Episode itself one suddenly finds coals from forests, and lake sediments. The onshore world had somehow overrun the offshore one. Read: That dinosaur-killing asteroid? It triggered global warming, too The global warming pulse had fueled violent storms and lashing rains that attacked Pangaea, leveled the topography\u2014eroding away whatever interesting terrain existed on the mainland\u2014and dumped it all into the ocean. In the Dolomites the tropical island paradise was suddenly smothered by this red mud and swallowed up by a bloating supercontinental shoreline. Similar signals of extreme rainfall and humidity are found in rocks all over the earth, from Japan to Argentina, as lakes and rivers briefly soaked a parched Pangaea. The extreme climate change apparently stressed trees so much that\u2014from Hungary to Arizona\u2014they exploded in resin (a defense mechanism seen in modern conifers under duress), leaving behind the first widespread deposits of amber in the fossil record, as documented by University of G\u00f6ttingen botanist Leyla Seyfullah. Like other similar heat waves deep in Earth\u2019s past, the crisis was accompanied by sweeping extinctions. A menagerie of lumbering beasts (many of them unfairly consigned to the C-list of natural-history museums), like rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts, was all but exterminated; while in the ocean the disaster is marked by a massacre of reefs, sea lilies, shelled octopus relatives, and a sinuous group of marine reptiles called thalattosaurs. Oxygen isotopes from the fossil teeth of tiny sea creatures reveal that the entire episode was kicked off by warming of only about 4\u20137 degrees Celsius\u2014roughly the same magnitude predicted for our own world under a business-as-usual carbon-emissions scenario. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an experiment in a laboratory to tell us what happens when CO2 rises quickly, because it\u2019s there in the rocks,\u201d Bernardi told me about this ancient natural experiment that the planet ran all on its own. \u201cIt is written.\u201d But perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the Carnian Pluvial Episode was not the crisis itself, but the world that came after. Until then, dinosaurs had been a puny and obscure lineage confined to the furthest southern reaches of Pangaea. But by the time the crisis was over, they had spread all over the world\u2014perhaps using the oddly humid pulse to hopscotch across the previously arid wastelands of Pangaea\u2014and rapidly diversified, using the extinction of their competitors to experiment with new lifestyles. The planet would never be the same. Bernardi pulled the museum truck up next to a typical tree-frosted colossus of beige rock that loomed over the valley floor. Halfway up, the cliff face was improbably interrupted by a crumbling medieval castle that had somehow been built into it more than 800 years ago. The castle apparently belonged to an older woman who waylaid us from her car window to complain to Bernardi in Italian about some teen trespassers, before driving away. Bernardi strapped on a helmet. \u201cYou should not go up there, it\u2019s not the safest place,\u201d he said, pausing to size up the cliff before us. \u201cIt can be done.\u201d With that, we began climbing. The rocks before us, some studded with seashells, were from sometime in the middle of the Triassic\u2014an endlessly fascinating period that lasted from 252 to 201 million years ago. The Triassic was one of the most unstable periods in the history of life. It kicked off in the wretched and scorching aftermath of Armageddon, as the planet struggled to recover from the greatest mass extinction it would ever endure, the dread End-Permian mass extinction. (Earth\u2019s cruelty to its own creatures knew no bounds in this terrible age, as a mere 3 million years after the apocalypse another minor mass extinction, the \u201cSmithian-Spathian,\u201d would punish the survivors for their courage.) And the Triassic concluded 50 million years later with a terrifying runner-up to doomsday: the End-Triassic mass extinction (like the Carnian Pluvial Episode, both the End-Permian and End-Triassic mass extinctions were carbon dioxide\u2013driven global-warming disasters). But sometime between these bookending nightmares came the impressive rise of the dinosaurs, mammals, and crocodilians, as well as modern conifers, corals, and even plankton. The Carnian Pluvial Episode has long been seen as something of a stratigraphic curio buried in the middle of this stack of time, dismissed by some geologists as a local or unimportant event. But amazingly, as the fossil record has come into finer resolution in recent years, not only has an overlooked mass extinction been uncovered in the Episode, but the closer the dramatic origin of all these creatures has edged toward the immediate aftermath of the mysterious event as well. It marked just as much a planetary birth as death. Read: The chilling regularity of mass extinctions \u201cWe have been stuck with a definition of extinction that is very easy to understand but is very misleading,\u201d said Bernardi, as I struggled to keep up on our hike. \u201cExtinction is more or less thought of as death, as the end, as something that does not go forward. That\u2019s obviously true but it\u2019s just half of the history. And some of the events are more easily described by what is happening after than before.\u201d When we finally reached the castle in the cliff\u2014what was left of it, at least\u2014Bernardi informed me that we were, in fact, standing in the Carnian Pluvial Episode itself. And it was no coincidence that this medieval redoubt had been built into the exact line in the rocks that marked the ancient cataclysm. In the mountain of hard, island-paradise rock beneath us, before the event, there were no dinosaurs anywhere in Europe. Where we were standing though, in the castle ruins, was a cavity, a natural cave. Eroded out of the cliff face were the strange Pangaean red clays\u2014the very same that had been dumped into the ocean by the unexpected megamonsoons of the Carnian Pluvial Episode, and that marked the fever of global warming. This disaster layer was softer than the otherwise hard ocean rock, and had thus been worn away. As a result, the ancient disaster had left a gap in the strata\u2014and the perfect place to build a castle. And, above us, more than a million years later, in the natural ceiling of the castle when the hard dolomite rock of an offshore Bahamas returned, and the Triassic world recovered, Bernardi pointed to the arrival of the dinosaurs: those unmistakable birdlike footprints of the planet\u2019s most legendary inhabitants, pressed into this former tidal flat, now a ceiling in the mountains. I asked Bernardi whose footprints he thinks will be found in the rock layers above our own chemistry experiment with the planet. \"I think we don\u2019t actually know how the grand scheme works and that is the scariest thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we might be just very close to changing something that then creates cascades of effects that we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know how it all works.\u201d Today we find ourselves at another very strange moment in the planet\u2019s history. In the coming decades our climate may return to a state that has analogues only deep in geological time. The global water cycle could intensify by 24 percent by 2100. Who knows what this will mean for a civilization already struggling to accommodate unprecedented rainfall events like Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, and Japanese floods that, in recent months, forced the evacuation of almost 2 million people and an intensification of storms worldwide. In these liminal moments before our planet truly leaps backward into geological history, the need to understand strange events like the Carnian Pluvial Episode has taken on new urgency. We know that when you kick the climate system hard enough, truly crazy things happen to the planet. And we know that we\u2019re kicking it about as hard as possible. But the lesson for posterity is that, however temporary these climate paroxysms, the world that comes after is never the same as the world that came before. Later in the day, after a vertiginous gondola ride, we met Bernardi\u2019s colleague Piero Gianolla on top of the snow-capped peak of Sass Pordoi, an alpine perch that provided jaw-dropping views of the Dolomites\u2019 jagged kingdom. Gianolla traced for me, across the immense, wintry landscape, how the narrow band of Carnian Pluvial Episode geology\u2014more than a million years of stormy chaos\u2014slipped secretly across the countryside. The eroding red line shaped not only caves in the sides of cliffs, but the entire vista of mountains before us: Here, the ubiquitous red-clay layer had broken some of the peaks in half and, there, produced vast flat plateaus of red rock spattered with the footsteps of early dinosaurs. Though they are often thought of as the mascots for mass extinction, dinosaurs benefited tremendously from the specter of indiscriminate destruction and climate chaos over their entire history\u2014from this, the Carnian Pluvial Episode, to the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic which took out their crocodilian competitors and ensured the dinosaurs\u2019 reign for over 100 million years. But mass extinction is an untameable fire and, in the end, brings about the fall of even the most storied empires. Two hundred and thirty-four million years ago a path was cleared by climate change for the dinosaurs\u2019 eventual dominance\u2014propelling a previously unimpressive tribe toward greatness, like a band of ragged but resourceful Romans overthrowing the Etruscans. If our species is in the late stages of empire, for whom are we clearing a path?","headline":"A Climate Catastrophe Paved the Way for the Dinosaurs\u2019 Reign","article_name":573286.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/dinosaurs-dolomites\/573286\/","date_published":"2018-10-22 14:19:38","article_length":13410,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:43.652104","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/dinosaurs-dolomites\/573286\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It was once the pinnacle of humanity\u2019s climate ambitions. A new UN-led climate report essentially concedes that it\u2019s out of reach. The world\u2019s most ambitious climate goal\u2014to keep the planet\u2019s average temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above its preindustrial level\u2014is still technically feasible. Technically . There is not yet so much greenhouse-gas pollution in the atmosphere that avoiding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming has become impossible, on paper. But it is now, in practice, probably impossible to achieve. On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations\u2013led panel of scientists and scholars charged with summarizing the world\u2019s understanding of global warming, released its newest report. Unlike its previous reports, which focused on the physical and social consequences of climate change, this missive looks at how humanity can reduce its carbon pollution and avert climate collapse. If most IPCC reports present a warning, this week\u2019s is more of a \u201chow to avoid the apocalypse\u201d guide. Read: The oceans we know won\u2019t survive climate change It is also the final report in the IPCC\u2019s current eight-year cycle of consensus reports. After this report (and a final \u201csynthesis\u201d report due later this year), the IPCC will not publish a major new document for years. This is the last report before the 1.5-degree-Celsius scenario becomes completely impossible. So it\u2019s worth looking at that goal\u2014and how it attained significance. In 2015, as part of negotiations over the Paris Agreement, the world\u2019s countries set a new goal of holding global warming to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d and preferably aiming for 1.5 degrees Celsius. (These translate to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.) The agreement also asked the IPCC to write a new report on the benefits of the 1.5-degree goal. Just by itself, enshrining the 1.5-degree goal in international law represented a victory for the small island nations , such as Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, which have historically called for the most aggressive climate policy because rising sea levels could wipe them off the map. But the political potency of the goal exceeded even their dreams. When the IPCC published its 1.5-degree report three years later, it detailed the dire famines, droughts, and disasters that would accompany even that level of warming. It inspired a new round of global climate concern. The aggressive climate action of the past few years\u2014Greta Thunberg\u2019s protests, Wall Street\u2019s calls for corporate sustainability, even Europe\u2019s Green Deal\u2014would have been unimaginable without the 1.5-degree report. Read: A sicker, poorer, and less abundant world So it is charged, to say the least, to suggest that such a goal may now be impossible. That\u2019s partly because achieving 1.5 degrees has never seemed particularly likely : The 2018 report shocked readers to some extent because it recognized that, in order to avoid climate catastrophe, the world needed to replace its energy system at an unprecedented pace. Decarbonization, too, has always required looking to the fantastic, the miraculous: Phasing out fossil fuels is both so difficult and so non-optional that any savvy realism must more closely resemble Marquez than Mearsheimer. But while the eyes search for divine assistance, the feet must stay on solid earth. And allowing a fantasy of 1.5 degrees to outlast its feasibility could curdle hope into bad assumptions, foolish thinking, or worse. \u201cIt\u2019s still technically possible to meet the 1.5-degree limit,\u201d Peter Erickson , the climate-policy program director at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told me, but \u201cthe window even for technical feasibility is rapidly shrinking.\u201d Since the initial report was published in 2018, global emissions have continued to rise, so it will be harder to achieve 1.5 degrees now than it was even when that report was written. \u201cEven of the scenarios they evaluate, only a third of them are able to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with any confidence,\u201d he said. Read: This land is the only land there is Oliver Geden , a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and one of the lead authors of the new IPCC report, agreed. \u201cI would say it\u2019s plausible to talk about it. I think it\u2019s not plausible to say that, given what we know right now, we won\u2019t [exceed] it,\u201d he told me. Even though the goal remains possible, the report makes clear that enough fossil-fuel infrastructure to blow past the goal has already been built. The world can emit as much carbon dioxide as it produced during the 2010s\u2014about 400 gigatons\u2014before it uses up the rest of its 1.5-degree budget, the new report finds. But the world\u2019s existing fossil-fuel infrastructure, as already built and financed, would generate another 660 to 850 gigatons of emissions. Meeting the goal will require taking coal, oil, and natural-gas capacity offline before it was designed to shut down. Read: Why the energy transition will be so complicated The question that really matters, both Erickson and Geden said, is not technical feasibility but political will and institutional capacity. So although the new IPCC report repeatedly finds that the 1.5-degree goal is technically feasible, it also establishes that the pace of institutional change required to achieve such a technical transition would have no historical precedent. Only a few countries have successfully moved away from a single fossil fuel in a single economic sector at the pace with which the entire world would need to eliminate all fossil fuels in all sectors, Erickson said. And even these examples are not necessarily encouraging. During the 1970s oil crisis, the United States accomplished one of the fastest energy transitions in history when it stopped burning petroleum to generate electricity. But it replaced that oil with domestically mined coal , a far dirtier fuel. More recently, the U.S. rapidly phased out its coal capacity, but it replaced that fuel not with zero-carbon energy, but with climate-polluting natural gas. Read: Life in the shadow of \u2018clean coal\u2019 The report praises a few examples of successful transitions, citing 24 countries that have successfully reduced their greenhouse-gas pollution for more than 10 years. But they\u2019re almost all wealthy industrialized countries, including the U.S., some Northern European nations, and former Soviet states. \u201cThe former Soviet bloc is no model for decarbonization by any stretch,\u201d Erickson said, because the lower emissions of those states accompanied a collapse in economic productivity. To its credit, the original 1.5-degree report recognized that humanity was unlikely to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius for the entire century. Instead, most of its scenarios envisioned that the world\u2019s temperature would overshoot that goal, and then humanity would bring the temperature back in line by removing massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere after 2050. To attempt anything more ambitious than that baseline, carbon-removal scenario, the countries of the world would have to marshal real political momentum for emissions reduction. \u201cI don\u2019t see political momentum\u201d for that kind of change, Geden said. Read: The green-energy culture wars in red states But as humanity keeps putting off the task of reducing its emissions, the amount of carbon that needs to be removed keeps growing. That could produce its own political issues, Geden said. The contours of UN climate talks \u201cwill change dramatically if you start assuming net negative [emissions] are possible. You could open up a new round of entirely magical thinking,\u201d he said. India, for instance, has already reasonably insisted that the world\u2019s most developed countries go carbon-negative before other countries do. But if you assume truly massive amounts of carbon removal are possible, then countries could simply assume that greater and greater amounts of carbon-dioxide removal will kick in as the century progresses. At the same time, the structure of international politics has changed since the 1.5-degree report first came out. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has fractured international economic cooperation in a way that was not expected in 2018, and both the war and the Western response seem likely to alter the fossil-fuel system . The IPCC has modeled dozens of different scenarios of future emissions, Erickson noted, but none that assumes the creation of a new major geopolitical rivalry foresees a path to the 1.5-degree goal. All of this has made Geden wonder if a more measured goal makes more sense. \u201cIs it 1.5 at any cost?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do we want to do 1.6? Is that a new aim because it\u2019s also \u2018well below 2 degrees Celsius\u2019?\u201d Read: We\u2019re heading straight for a demi-Armageddon Erickson said that advocates and politicians should keep the new goal in mind, but not base their entire strategy on it. \u201c\u20181.5 or Bust\u2019 is not a recipe for success, or equity, or for frankly reducing the worst impacts of climate change. And maybe that\u2019s a straw man, but you know, there are groups that are building their campaign strategies around that goal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful conversation. It still seems like we should do everything we can. But to the extent that we foreclose backup strategies in the singular pursuit of 1.5 degrees Celsius, that could be problematic.\u201d","headline":"The 1.5-Degree Goal Is All But Dead","article_name":629486.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/un-ipcc-1-5-degree-report-global-warming\/629486\/","date_published":"2022-04-06 12:15:00","article_length":9392,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:44.065354","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/un-ipcc-1-5-degree-report-global-warming\/629486\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Six experts explain how to recognize the many new faces of grief during a pandemic. As of this writing, the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 50,000 people in the United States and more than 200,000 people worldwide. These deaths\u2019 inevitable companion is grief, but the turmoil of the pandemic is altering and interrupting the normal course of mourning. People are experiencing many different kinds of loss simultaneously\u2014some of them unique to or changed by this moment in history. Because of the risk of viral transmission, many people are dying apart from their loved ones, and many others are mourning apart from theirs. Meanwhile, those who haven\u2019t lost someone personally are surrounded by daily reminders of death, and are mourning their lost routines, jobs, and plans for the future, all while fearing for their health and that of their friends and family. \u201cI think that this situation is very, very difficult for people,\u201d says George Bonanno, a researcher who studies grief. \u201cBut by the same token, people will get through it, probably the same way that people have gotten through other kinds of losses. They\u2019ll just need to be a little more creative about it.\u201d Based on decades of research, Bonanno calls grief a \u201cnatural adaptive reaction\u201d\u2014a painful but necessary mental recalibration to accommodate a new absence. Bonanno was one of half a dozen experts I consulted in an attempt to catalog how mourning is changing in the coronavirus era. These six, whose fields span academic research and clinical psychology, were not in conversation with one another, but they addressed many of the same themes. Their comments below have been edited for length and clarity. The pandemic has made the usual gatherings that follow a death dangerous, depriving mourners of a traditional funeral as well as the comfort of friends\u2019 and loved ones\u2019 physical presence. Megan Devine, a psychotherapist and the author of It\u2019s OK That You\u2019re Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn\u2019t Understand : Grief can be a really isolating experience, and that has been very much magnified during the pandemic. The things we do to support people who are grieving\u2014coming over to someone\u2019s house with a casserole, attending a wake\u2014are not options in the way that we usually think of them. On top of that, everybody is struggling with their own stuff, so the available emotional bandwidth is very much reduced. George Bonanno, a clinical-psychology professor at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College and the author of The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss : Cultures all over the world have these rituals where people take care of a bereaved person, and one thing these rituals do is connect the people who are present\u2014the person they\u2019re mourning may be gone, but they see that others are still here. People who come to your wedding are in your life forever, in a strange way, and it\u2019s sort of the same thing with funerals. These people came together around a death in your life, which is really a powerful thing. That\u2019s the way it works normally. Ramtin Arablouei: The coronavirus is stealing our ability to grieve Joshua Coleman, a psychologist and a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Contemporary Families: Humans are wired to reassure and to comfort . In my practice, I\u2019ve seen that it is not only distressing to be deprived of receiving comfort, but similarly to be deprived of the ability to provide comfort. Not being able to directly comfort loved ones who are grieving right now is also painful. Kami Fletcher, a history professor at Albright College and the president of the Collective for Radical Death Studies : One of the things about mourning and grief in African American communities is that we\u2019ve been stereotyped so many times in life, but in death we are able to have our humanity: You have people in the community who are able to show who this person was by getting up at the podium to talk about someone or playing a slideshow of their life. The fact that we cannot gather and grieve is a really big blow. Unable to be physically together, many people have conducted memorial services on group video calls. Virtual funerals are not inherently worse than in-person events\u2014but they are very different. Bonanno: When we gather to mourn, we tell stories about the person who died and make little speeches about them, which helps build an image of the person that you take with you: They may be gone, but this is who they were . I think people have to do their best to find ways to do that while apart. You can create Facebook pages or email people or send letters and ask people if they have stories to share. I\u2019ve participated in a few of those kinds of things with friends of mine who have lost loved ones, and I think they\u2019re quite powerful. Not everyone is as comfortable doing that as [they would be doing] a memorial service, but that\u2019s what we have right now. Devine: One thing I\u2019ve heard from people recently is that the virtual funeral\u2014or memorial, or wake, or shiva\u2014was more moving to them than an in-person one. In-person funerals are familiar: You dress up, you go, you pay respects, you do the receiving line, and then everybody gathers for food afterward. Having to come together in a virtual space is new, and that act of novelty can break us out of things and make us feel and connect in different ways, though certainly that\u2019s not true for everybody. Read: Notes from a videochat memorial The thing to remember is that there\u2019s no time limit on when you could hold an in-person funeral. You can do that at a later date, so a virtual service doesn\u2019t have to be a flat-out replacement. There are some really creative ways to plan a virtual service. Maybe you could send out a recipe that the person used to make and have everybody make it so that you can all join in a meal together. Because of the risk of viral transmission, many people whose loved ones die in the hospital are unable to be with them in their final days. Those people lose an opportunity for last words and closure. Bonanno: When we lose a loved one, we struggle a lot more if we imagine them in pain at the end of their lives. It\u2019s harder to grieve those kinds of losses, because you picture your loved one suffering, and in the case of a death in a hospital, there\u2019s a sense of fear and loneliness that you can imagine them having experienced. Devine: Not being at your person\u2019s bedside at the end of their life adds extra layers of suffering. It might add guilt: Even though you weren\u2019t allowed to be there, there\u2019s a sense that you should have been anyway, or that you should have realized that they were sick sooner. There\u2019s also a lot of survivor\u2019s guilt around the coronavirus because the virus is transmitted by close contact\u2014someone might think, I just saw my dad three weeks ago. Maybe I gave this to him . That survivor\u2019s guilt is uncomfortable, and adds extra layers of suffering on top of grief itself, but it\u2019s very normal. Pauline Boss, a professor emeritus of family social science at the University of Minnesota and the author of Ambiguous Loss: Learning to Live With Unresolved Grief : When people don\u2019t have a body to bury, it\u2019s quite natural for them to hope that the person who died is still alive somewhere. As human beings, we need to see the body of our loved one, to have remains, in order to know that our loved one has been transformed into another state. That\u2019s missing now for many people because the body is whisked away and they don\u2019t get to see it for a certain amount of time. So even many clear-cut losses have become ambiguous\u2014unclear and lacking resolution. Death is more present than it usually is in daily life\u2014people are surrounded by reminders of it in the news, in stories from friends and loved ones, and in the sirens of ambulances. Devine: When I hear a siren go by, my habit\u2014and it has been for years\u2014is to wish them luck. Right now, we can\u2019t get away from the overwhelming volume of loss, and that\u2019s forcing us to really let in how fragile life is and how easily that siren could be for us or someone we care about. To deal with that, it might help to come up with a ritual, a habit, that you do after you hear a siren or read a news story. One of the things that\u2019s happened during the pandemic is we don\u2019t have the usual protections that keep the idea of death at a distance. Often, we say things to ourselves like, I always wear my seatbelt \u2014or I do X, Y, and Z\u2014so I don\u2019t have to think about that too much . But right now, we can\u2019t say, Oh, that would never happen to me . With this virus, it\u2019s so uncertain\u2014being outside can kill you. So there\u2019s grief, yes, and there\u2019s also a lot of anxiety mixed in with that. Boss: I think it's triggering anxiety about our own mortality. I mean, why wouldn\u2019t it? We\u2019re all in danger. Science is coming, but it isn\u2019t ahead of the game yet, and there are conflicting messages from leaders about what to do and what not to do. The anxiety we\u2019re all feeling right now is collective and understandable. Carmen Inoa Vazquez, a clinical psychologist and a co-author of Grief Therapy With Latinos : Right now, a lot of people are experiencing a sense of communal grief\u2014they may feel like this could happen to any one of us, and they may know people who have died. Some people who have lost loved ones in the past will tell you that eventually\u2014and the amount of time varies\u2014they started to take a different approach to life and find meaning in the loss and in their future. So during and after the pandemic, maybe people will try to pay more attention to their unfulfilled wishes, or have conversations with loved ones that they may not usually have and affirm their love for those people. In this way, the pandemic can bring unity and connection, and help us deal with our mortality. On top of its death toll, the pandemic has also stripped away many aspects of life that give it joy and meaning\u2014canceling graduation ceremonies, causing layoffs, unraveling visions of the future. These losses are more abstract than deaths, but grieving them is no less valid. Boss: The loss of having answers to questions, the loss of a routine, the loss of freedom to go out and do what we please, the loss of being able to hug our loved ones and be with our friends\u2014those are all major losses, and they have to do with the relationship between ourselves and the changing world. These losses are not the ones we have sympathy cards or rituals to deal with, and grief for these losses often gets stuck because there are no supports for it. When nobody notices or acknowledges it, that makes it so much harder for the people who are experiencing it. What we need to do now is name these losses. You can\u2019t cope with something until you have a name for it. Read: On top of everything else, my dog died Bonanno: One former student of mine showed that you can actually have a grief reaction for anything that\u2019s really a part of your identity. And people are losing their identities right now: Someone opened a bookstore a couple months ago and now the bookstore is going to go under. That was their dream, and it\u2019s gone. All the seniors graduating from college, they\u2019re not going to have a ceremony, and they\u2019re finishing online classes. People can grieve for that. If they feel grief, they should let themselves feel it. Devine: The people who are wrestling with grief because they lost their job\u2014that\u2019s a very valid loss, and it deserves to be honored and acknowledged, just as we should acknowledge the grief of somebody whose sibling died of the virus. Those losses are not the same, but they are equally valid. And that\u2019s a really important distinction: If we say something like, \u201cMy 30-year-old sister died of the virus and that\u2019s way worse than your 97-year-old father dying of the virus, because at least he got to live to 97,\u201d that\u2019s a competition for compassion\u2014that\u2019s treating compassion as a scarce resource. But really all loss is valid, all grief is valid. Every loss should be heard and acknowledged, because it\u2019s important to the person experiencing it. Inoa Vazquez: If you lose a loved one, these other losses can make the grieving process much harder. For instance, if someone in your household is having financial issues right now and they are grieving over a death as well, they might be less resilient and empathic. Sometimes families that come to my practice are in different places with their grief: Somebody might think that you should not dismantle Mom\u2019s bedroom; some people think you should wait X amount of time after the death to dress in a certain way. Now, during the pandemic, people are very stressed, which could result in people having less patience, less understanding, less self-control when they\u2019re dealing with a loss together. And if a family loses a financial provider right now, that could add even more stress and again complicate the normal resolution of their grief. One grim pattern that has emerged from the early data on deaths from COVID-19 in the United States is that black and Hispanic Americans appear to be more likely than white Americans to die from it . Grief in each of those communities carries unique and specific resonances. Fletcher: This is definitely shining a light on these systemic inadequacies of being medically underserved, which is an added layer of grief. In the black community, we\u2019ve always had to depend on ourselves\u2014the government doesn\u2019t necessarily see us as folks who need immediate help in the way that they see white America. As a result, the things that will help us cope and memorialize now are things that we\u2019ve already put in place. For example, part of my research is on RIP T-shirts . They\u2019re a memorial that anybody can access, and black Americans with those T-shirts are tying deaths to systematic oppression and refusing to be silent. Read: The pandemic will cleave America in two Inoa Vazquez: This situation can intensify the grieving experience for many people who are immigrants. The immigration experience brings a lot of losses, and in moments of grief, in moments like this, these losses can be reignited and brought to the surface. You lose your culture, you lose those connections that you had, and you have to readjust. The Latino population has lost a lot of people to the virus, and those previous experiences can delay the process of finding closure. During the pandemic, health-care workers will experience more deaths firsthand than perhaps any other segment of society. Their grief will be destabilizing and overwhelming. Devine: What I\u2019m hearing from health-care providers is that this is brutal. They\u2019re seeing people die not only without their friends and family, but sometimes in great distress because of the nature of this disease. Under normal circumstances, these workers know how to make the end-of-life process more gentle both for the person dying and for their friends and family, and yet right now they\u2019re not allowed to do those things or don\u2019t have the resources to do them. So they\u2019re heartbroken. They also have the added challenge of making decisions about separating themselves from their own friends and family to keep those people safe. We\u2019re asking people to go into these very challenging situations at work, but without having any off switch at home at the end of the day. In normal times, palliative-care, hospice, and ER teams can go home to a sense of normalcy and lean on their loved ones after a long day. They can\u2019t do that right now, which means they\u2019re having to lean on each other, and they only have so much emotional bandwidth to do that. When someone dies of COVID-19, their death occurs against the backdrop of a historic event, instead of being a self-contained story all its own. That fact could shape the grieving process. Bonanno: I did research about 9\/11, and one way a national tragedy makes grieving even harder is there\u2019s so much pain right now. There\u2019s this amplified sadness. But I think in the long run, it may actually be\u2014 helpful is not the right word\u2014but it may give people something to hold on to in a strange way. After 9\/11, I interviewed a lot of people who were in the towers but got out and survived. Some of them were traumatized by it, but there was a sense that you had this story that you could tell people and they immediately knew some of what you went through without knowing your particular story. People reference your story to this historical event, and this might help you reach a shared understanding. Fletcher: There\u2019s a concern that the experiences of people of color, folks from marginalized communities, will get swallowed up in this grander narrative of the pandemic, with a homogenous story about the large group of people who are dying of COVID-19. There may even be acknowledgments that people with certain diseases died at higher rates. But I\u2019m worried that the racial patterns will get overlooked, and that there will be a real throwing-away of the black community as the story of the pandemic is recorded and remembered. Devine: I\u2019ve heard that after 9\/11, many people felt that their personal losses were overshadowed by the national disaster, and this is something we\u2019re seeing right now, in a way. People who are losing people to non-virus-related causes are sort of being erased because the spotlight is on this other thing. Boss: In a way, it might be easier on the families left behind if they know that their loved one left because of such a great power outside of their control, and that others shared in the same kind of loss. They\u2019re not alone, and it\u2019s pretty clear to them that they\u2019re not alone.","headline":"All the Things We Have to Mourn Now","article_name":610933.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2020\/05\/grief-mourning-death-pandemic\/610933\/","date_published":"2020-05-01 13:46:02","article_length":17618,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:44.146935","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2020\/05\/grief-mourning-death-pandemic\/610933\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The issue demonstrates how Republicans are encouraged to take needlessly extreme positions with little real world benefit In order to understand how talk radio encourages politicians to make needlessly polarizing statements, ponder the recent back and forth on climate change among two GOP primary candidates. Last week, Mitt Romney spoke about the issue in New Hampshire. He opposes a \"cap-and-trade\" limit on carbon emissions. Like the vast majority of climate scientists, however, he believes that climate change is happening, and that humans are playing some role. He's held that position for awhile, but his recent answer on the subject prompted the following comment from Rush Limbaugh: \"Bye-bye, nomination. Another one down. We're in the midst here of discovering that this is all a hoax. The last year has established that the whole premise of man-made global warming is a hoax, and we still have presidential candidates that want to buy into it!\" That happened on Tuesday. As if in response, Rick Santorum said this Wednesday on the Rush Limbaugh program: Set aside the merits of the issue - let's just talk politics. Which of these arguments is going to appeal to the biggest anti-carbon-tax, anti-cap-and-trade alliance? And which would prove least popular: 1) Climate change may be happening - we may even be causing it. But even if that's true, now isn't the right time to address it. Now is the time to focus on jobs. 2) Climate change may be happening - we may even be causing it. But a cold, rational look at a carbon tax or cap-and-trade show that the substantial costs either would impose on our economy outweigh the benefits. We're better off trying to solve the problem by investing in new technology. 3) Climate change may be happening, but we aren't causing it. 4) Climate change isn't happening, and the people who say otherwise are mistaken. 5) Climate change isn't happening, and the people who say otherwise are engaged in a widespread ideological conspiracy - they know it isn't happening, but are pretend otherwise so that they can control your lives. To me, number five has by far the least appeal in a general election, seeing as how it's wildly implausible. It's arguably a paranoid delusion, and even posits some alternate 1970s when claims about global cooling successfully vested liberals with significant control over the lives of Americans. But the statement that appeals to the narrowest spectrum of voters (number five) is the one that talk radio hosts like Limbaugh encourage, even though numbers one through four would appeal to more voters and end in the relevant candidate taking the exact same real world policy stance (no cap-and-trade). By caring about the symbolism of issues far more than policy outcomes, the GOP is ensuring its eventual nominee will find it harder to win a general election. Wouldn't it be better to extract from Romney a promise that he won't favor a carbon tax either?

{"id":null,"body":"The space agency is exploring what three Earth-observation start-ups can teach it about the planet. SAN FRANCISCO \u2014The sky has filled with eyes, and NASA is starting to notice. Over the past several years, venture-funded start-ups have hurled hundreds of inexpensive satellites into orbit. For-profit companies have used smartphone technology to make compact satellites that look down at Earth and monitor its every oceanic gurgle, erupting volcano, or forest conflagration. Hundreds of these satellites might gaze down at the same time; they are organized in what are called (rather poetically) \u201cconstellations.\u201d NASA has now taken heed of these new arrangements. Earlier this year, it asked 36 scientists to figure out whether imagery and data from three satellite companies could be put to serious scientific use. On Thursday, the San Francisco\u2013based start-up Planet announced that it is one of the three companies participating in the pilot program. Among NASA\u2019s goals: Decide whether data from the three satellite companies can be used to create a dashboard of what are called \u201c essential climate variables .\u201d These core clues to planetary health\u2014which include figures tracking the size of leaves, the health of Arctic permafrost, and the extent of groundwater reservoirs\u2014could function as a kind of early-warning system for environmental upheaval. This program also reflects a potential shift for NASA. The space agency is already preparing to send a human crew to orbit in a commercial spacecraft later this year. It might soon rely on for-profit companies when collecting scientific data, too. The announcement is something of a coup for Planet, which operates what it describes as the largest private constellation of Earth-observing satellites ever assembled. Planet\u2019s leaders have long described their company as a boon not just for the financial and defense industries\u2014the usual customers for this kind of data\u2014but for scientists and humanitarians. Now they have the NASA deal to prove it. Read: A new 50-trillion-pixel image of Earth, every day But it could raise more difficult questions for researchers. Science is conducted largely as a public good, and researchers can vet one another\u2019s work by checking it against publicly available data. If that basic data is no longer publicly available, it could mean that major earth-science research relies on proprietary data. I recently visited Planet\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco. Housed in an unassuming former warehouse in the city\u2019s SoMa neighborhood, its office melds the feel of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., with the unfinished, exposed-brick-and-metal aesthetic that the writer Kyle Chayka has called \u201c AirSpace .\u201d One floor is an open-plan office with rows of sleek monitors and small meeting rooms. The next floor up is a shining clean room where dozens of satellites are manufactured every year. Planet is now the dominant satellite-imagery start-up in the Bay Area. In 2015, it bought RapidEye , giving it five military-grade satellites. Two years later, it acquired its rival small-satellite manufacturer Terra Bella in a deal with Alphabet. Today roughly 120 Planet satellites float in orbit\u2014most of them are about the size of a shoebox\u2014allowing the company to photograph every spot on Earth at least once a day. Planet can also boast association with a large research community. More than 100 peer-reviewed papers cite Planet data. Researchers have used Planet imagery to monitor Arctic lakes , track ships , and tally the biomass of forests . Jamon Van Den Hoek , a professor at Oregon State University and one of the 36 scientists currently adjudicating the NASA pilot project, told me that Earth imagery now functions as a crucial data source for scientists. The pixels are the data, he told me: \u201cThese aren\u2019t just for reference. These aren\u2019t just for a base map. These are the data you analyze.\u201d A certain shade of pixel might say whether a forest is thriving or clear-cut, or it might suggest that a once open meadow has been swallowed by a city. As part of the NASA pilot program, Van Den Hoek has used Planet data to help search for and study Earth\u2019s \u201cmissing million\u201d people\u2014refugees and internally displaced people who live in informal camps and settlements in the least mapped parts of the planet. The project would constitute the first systematic analysis of how these settlements change over time, he said. Not all of this is new: Scientists have been using pixels as data for the past half century. Since 1972, satellites in the U.S. government\u2019s Landsat program have systematically photographed every speck of land on Earth, every 16 days, without fail. Landsat, now one of the largest and most powerful tranches of earth-science data, is an invaluable scientific resource. In the 1980s, it revealed the extent and severity of Amazon deforestation; now it captures the massive changes to Earth\u2019s surface wrought by climate change. One of the most widely cited satellite data sets, a global survey of forest loss created by the University of Maryland professor Chris Hansen, is powered by Landsat data. Read: Silicon Valley\u2019s new spy satellites But the program\u2019s future is more uncertain\u2014and its fate is tied to Planet\u2019s. The next Landsat satellite, dubbed Landsat 9, is due to launch late next year . But NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey have considered using a new approach with its successor, Landsat 10. They could replace it with two satellites instead, mimicking an EU program . Or they could try replacing Landsat with a swarm of satellites, creating a publicly owned version of Planet\u2019s constellation. Some lawmakers have even proposed that the government rely entirely on private-sector data for Landsat 10. Van Den Hoek said that seemed unlikely, at least for now. \u201cPeople who hold the purse strings may want that to happen, but no one at NASA wants that to happen,\u201d he said. Planet, too, supports the Landsat program and doesn\u2019t want to see it change significantly, a spokesperson told me. The company\u2019s satellites revisit the same speck of land more often than Landsat\u2019s do, and its cameras have a higher resolution. But its craft are unable to capture as many types of light. Planet tries to make as much of its data available to as many researchers as possible, and some universities now have blanket licenses to much of its imagery. The company remains a commercial enterprise (albeit one that has not yet turned a profit), but Joe Mascaro, an ecologist who now directs academic partnerships for Planet, told me that the replicability of research is a \u201ccore principle we would do our best to meet.\u201d And if Planet explores \u201cfuture, larger contracts with NASA,\u201d says Trevor Hammond, Planet\u2019s vice president of communications, it \u201cwould go in with its eyes open\u201d about the tension between open science and closed data. Van Den Hoek emphasized that Landsat and Planet are good at different tasks. Landsat could capture widespread shifts to the land: urbanization, deforestation, the loss of polar ice. Planet excels at more fine-grained tasks. \u201cYou can ask questions that you could never ask before,\u201d he said. \u201cHuge portions of sub-Saharan Africa rely on small-scale agriculture for daily subsistence. You can\u2019t measure that with Landsat data.\u201d NASA is also working with Spire Global , a Bay Area start-up that collects high-quality weather data, and Maxar , a more established player that owns the WorldView spy satellites. Peter Platzer, the chief executive of Spire, told me in an email that NASA plans to spend $100 million on small-satellite projects over the next few years.","headline":"What Spy-Satellite Companies Can Teach NASA About Climate Change","article_name":586921.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/nasa-will-study-climate-profit-spy-satellites\/586921\/","date_published":"2019-04-11 13:23:26","article_length":7609,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:45.513512","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/nasa-will-study-climate-profit-spy-satellites\/586921\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Like canaries in the coalmines of yore, low-lying islands in the midst of the world's vast oceans face the possibility of extinction. Rising waters from global warming could literally drown many of them in the decades to come. At the climate change conference in Copenhagen, voices from these vulnerable island nations--places like Tuvalu in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean--are singing loudly and persistently to be heard at the 12 day United Nations summit. Their controversial, and emotional, pleas for tougher action will be an underlying source of tension in the final deliberations this week. \"I woke up this morning crying, and that's not easy for a grown man to admit,\" Ian Fry, the chief climate negotiator for the 12,000 people of Tuvalu, told hundreds of delegates gathered in the conference's Bella Center on Saturday. \"The fate of my country rests in your hands,\" he said, reportedly choking up as he spoke. Miners once carried caged canaries into unventilated shafts to warn of the build-up of lethal poisonous gases: the birds were especially susceptible to hazardous gases like methane and carbon monoxide, so when they stopped singing and died it served as a warning for immediate evacuation. The nine coral atolls of Tuvalu and other vulnerable islands and coastal regions could be the global equivalent: harbingers of what might eventually happen in other parts of the world if not enough is done to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But the big question on the table this week is how far countries like the United States and China--the world's two biggest carbon dioxide contributors--are willing to go in the current treaty talks.\u00a0 Essentially, it's a gamble about how much is needed in terms of emissions cuts and how much economic and political capital they are willing or able to spend at a time of great financial stress and continuing public debate over climate change science and policy. The unresolved differences concern how to prevent some of the worst-case climate change scenarios from coming true during this century. For the past week Tuvalu, with the support of a coalition of 43 other small island nations called the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), has been pushing for a tougher, binding agreement in Copenhagen with a target of limiting future global temperature increases to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That's less than the upper limit of 2 degrees C. that others have suggested for industrialized countries. But all are ambitious reaches: in the first official Copenhagen draft, a UN working group hedged on the numbers by saying 1.5 to 2 degrees C. (which would require major industrialized countries to reduce emissions to somewhere between 25 and 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2020) . A half-degree difference might not seem like much to the outside observer, but it means a lot in terms of the costs to both sides. Industrialized nations have argued that it is not feasible and would be too costly in terms of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in any case. (Even the 2 degree C. target is a stretch.) But the island nations argue it could be all the difference in terms of their countries' ultimate survival. The projected temperature rises are based on long-range scientific forecasting of the potential environmental hazards of various levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. (For an interesting visual exercise in how these various numbers might play out, see the New York Times blog Dot Earth .) Since the prospects for the most ambitious climate curbs still seem slim, emotions are running high in Copenhagen among those from the countries at greatest risk. Among the most impassioned voices at the opening of the conference was a 15-year-old \"climate ambassador\" from the Maldives. The Maldives are a tropical tourist mecca of some 1,200 flat islands in the Indian Ocean that are less than seven feet above sea level, with many spots three feet or less above sea level and whose coral reef borders are already eroding. Mohamed Axam Maumoon , who took the stage with heavyweights like the Danish Prime Minister, drew a standing ovation after asking \"since the future is for our children, you must first think about this: How old will your children be in 2050? Or will they be lucky to survive this dying earth?\" Later, in a television interview , he had far blunter words for the largest greenhouse gas-emitting nations: \"...it's as good as killing us off. So I ask you again, would you commit murder, even while we are begging for mercy and begging for you to stop what you're doing, change your ways, and let our children see the future that we want to build for them?\" The president of his country, who has scheduled a press conference on Wednesday in Copenhagen to launch the Maldives' \"carbon neutral plan,\" has been equally dramatic in trying to capture world attention.\u00a0 Mohamed Nasheed, a political activist who became the Maldives first democratically elected president, recently held the world's first underwater cabinet meeting , wearing wet suits and air tanks, to draw attention to what could happen to his country. Upon taking office last year he quickly jumped on climate change, announcing that he hoped to set up a trust fund to purchase new homeland elsewhere should the country's 360,000 people need to be relocated because of rising waters. Stunts or not, Nasheed is also urging his fellow island countries to become more carbon-neutral themselves--he's promoting the idea of getting renewable energy from windmills in the turquoise waters off his islands' shores. The most vulnerable developing countries will also be hitting hard this week for more money in an emergency adaptation fund to help mitigate the worst effects of global warming--more than the $10 billion per year for which UN climate chief Yvo de Boer is already having trouble getting commitments. The peoples of small island countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Grenada, as well as populated coastal regions of countries like Bangladesh fear they will become the next climate refugees, facing evacuation from their impoverished islands over the next 50 years if rising waters swallow their shallow shores and threaten homes and water supply. Dessima Williams of Grenada, the spokeswoman for the group of small islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, said that its members \"are at the front line of devastating impacts of climate change.\" I began following this climate change story closely after Anote Tong, the London-educated president of the scattered central Pacific islands of Kiribati, came to Boston to lecture at Harvard and receive an award for his environmental stewardship. I then set up an email correspondence with the office of the Maldives president for an in-depth piece earlier this year in Science News , in which Nasheed said in a statement that \"if we are unable to save countries like the Maldives, it may be too late to save the rest of the world....\" Many could argue that there are multiple threats to these island nations, including population growth and limited resources. But some of the world's most distinguished climate scientists believe that the long term threat posed by melting polar ice from global warming is essentially the tipping point that could indeed put them over the edge, if they aren't poised to go there already.

{"id":null,"body":"A new study in The Lancet makes the case that global warming is already ailing public health worldwide, but experts disagree on its methodology. Climate change is already afflicting human health worldwide, exposing tens of millions of elderly people to excess heat while possibly reducing the ability of hundreds of millions of workers to do their jobs, according to an expansive new synthesis from The Lancet , one of the world\u2019s oldest and most widely cited medical journals. The report examines dozens of statistics from around the planet and finds that the long-predicted effects of climate change have already become a reality in many places. Heat waves now last longer, reaching more people and broiling more territory, than they did in the 1980s and 1990s. In the United States, this spike in warmth is lengthening the allergy season, sometimes by weeks, and helping infectious diseases to spread. But one of its techniques is questionable. Its findings about the global economy raised eyebrows among academic economists who more formally study climate change. \u201cThe human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible\u2014affecting the health of populations around the world today,\u201d warn the paper\u2019s coauthors, who are drawn from nonprofits and 24 different academic institutions. \u201cWhilst these effects will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable in society, every community will be affected.\u201d The report, dubbed \u201cCountdown 2017,\u201d represents the first coherent attempt to unify many of the different climate-related threads in medical and global-health research. In 2015, a commission of researchers\u2014also convened by The Lancet \u2014warned that climate change could \u201cundermine the last 50 years of gains in public health.\u201d They also called for more comprehensive tracking of important climate signals. This report, which will now be updated annually, is the result. The coauthors have pulled together figures and estimates from across the medical literature and attempted to tabulate single, worldwide figures for many values. Some of its techniques may have significant weaknesses. The Lancet report makes an eye-popping assertion about the global economy, arguing that climate change has already significantly harmed labor capacity around the world. Between 2015 and 2016\u2014which are the second- and first-hottest years ever recorded\u2014it argues that \u201coutdoor-labor capacity\u201d fell by 2 percent. Since the year 2000, outdoor-labor capacity has fallen by 5.3 percent overall, it claims. Academic economists who study climate change were very doubtful of this estimate. \u201cI would back way off the claim that [the data] show any of these things, since they don\u2019t have or use any actual data on labor,\u201d said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the Climate Impact Lab . The Lancet authors, he said, used a technique drawn from a 2013 Nature Climate Change article to estimate \u201clabor capacity.\u201d They effectively interpolated temperature data with conclusions from U.S. military and industrial experiments, from 1996 and 2003 , that researched how much work soldiers could do in different temperature conditions. But their findings do not align to a type of labor measurements that economists usually track. \u201cThe numbers presented are (in the most generous interpretation) actual measurements (although still not sure what kind) from a few military lab experiments using U.S. soldiers as subjects and then extrapolated to people across Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia,\u201d Hsiang told me in an email. He continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lots of ways this could go wrong, since we don\u2019t know if people adapt, we don\u2019t know if U.S. soldiers are good proxies for normal people in Indonesia, and we don\u2019t have any idea how the \u201clabor-capacity\u201d index these guys put together actually connects to \u201clabor productivity\u201d or earnings as any economist would recognize it.\u201d Climate change will almost certainly harm global labor output , but a lack of empirical observations around the world makes the kind of measurement The Lancet is attempting difficult. The controversy points to one of the most difficult aspects of finding climate change\u2019s effects on human life: While scientists can measure weather worldwide, measuring the fingerprint of climate change on all human activity is far more complicated. The Lancet report makes other broad claims about global public health that were more widely accepted. It finds that many more older people experience heat waves now than did two or three decades ago. The report says that roughly 175 million more people older than 65 worldwide were exposed to excess heat in 2015 as compared to several decades ago. On average, 125 million more older adults are exposed to heat than were in previous decades. In the United States, an additional 14.5 million people older than 65 were exposed, a number larger than the population of Pennsylvania. Howard Frumkin, one of the coauthors of the report and a professor of public health at the University of Washington , said that heat\u2019s health effects are insidious. While a heat wave may only seem to directly kill a couple thousand people via heat stroke, researchers find that hotter months\u2014when studied after the fact\u2014have many more deaths than would otherwise be expected. \u201cHeat does a lot of things to people. It disrupts sleep and contributes to sleeplessness. It triggers violence\u2014crime goes up during heat waves. It may trigger self-harm. And there\u2019s very strong evidence that occupational injuries rise during heat waves,\u201d he told me. Heat appears to function as a general stressor on people, wearing down the most vulnerable among them. The European heat wave of 2003, one of the worst natural disasters ever experienced, is estimated to have ultimately killed more than 70,000 people . The report also examines climate-related migration from around the world. It finds that a minimum of 4,400 people have definitively been forced to leave their homes because of climate change. \u201cThe total number for which climate change is a significant or deciding factor is much higher,\u201d it adds (and it exempts events like the Syrian Civil War, which some experts think climate change helped aggravate). While this number may seem small, it presages tens of thousands more relocations to come. It also shows how poorly documented most of the relocations are: Most of the 4,400 come not from inundated islands or low-lying coasts in the tropics, but from indigenous villages in northern Alaska. The report does pull out a spot of good news: Despite a 44 percent increase in the number of extreme-weather events since 2000 (as compared to the decades before that), there\u2019s been no equivalent rise in the number of deaths. Frumkin said that suggested that\u2014if it plans ahead\u2014society may be able to adapt to some of the consequences of climate change. A separate report from The Lancet pulls out specific findings about how climate change has already altered the public health of the United States. The allergy season here is getting much longer: Nebraska\u2019s ragweed season has extended by 17 days since the early 1990s, and Minneapolis has seen it lengthen by 21 days. The ragweed season in Kansas City, Missouri, extended by 23 days and it now nearly encompasses a quarter of the year. And certain insect-borne infectious diseases are already showing climate-related spikes. Doctors found three times as many Lyme cases in the United States were diagnosed in 2016, compared to 1990. And mosquitoes that carry dengue fever now transmit the virus 5 percent more effectively than they did a couple decades ago. Public-health groups in the United States used the report to make a larger point about the direction of American climate policy. \u201cThe report emphasizes the scale of the threats to human health\u2014and makes clear that reducing dangerous climate pollution is critical to protect health and save lives,\u201d said Harold P. Wimmer, the president of the American Lung Association, in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must listen to this latest warning and implement strong tools, including many already in place, to fight climate change and protect the health and safety of all Americans. We urge the EPA to halt its efforts to repeal the Clean Power Plan,\u201d he added. Frumkin said it made sense to link the report\u2019s conclusions to recent policy changes. \u201cIn my view, and the view of most health professionals, the current administration\u2019s policies are nothing short of tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re misguided; they will cause more suffering and deaths in the population; and they will only delay us in our attempts to tackle climate change.\u201d \u201cThe impacts of climate change are not some distant future event. They\u2019re happening now,\u201d he added.","headline":"A Contested Finding in a Major New Climate-Change Report","article_name":544559.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/the-lancet-climate-change-economics\/544559\/","date_published":"2017-11-02 18:54:25","article_length":8820,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:47.113989","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/the-lancet-climate-change-economics\/544559\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"If current trends continue, the landscapes of states like New Mexico and Arizona may soon be unrecognizable.\u00a0 The fire that burned through Forest Canyon, a breathtaking stretch of wilderness ringed by snowy peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, started in October and burned long past the end of the fire season. Trees still smoldered in late December, and the smoke mixed with dry snow blowing in the air. Known as the Fern Lake Fire, the blaze tore through 3,500 acres of land the federal government set aside a century ago both to provide public enjoyment and protect it from human destruction. One of those missions has been accomplished: 3.1 million people visit the park each year. Increasingly, however, the destruction it was meant to prevent is encroaching. Like most wildfires, the Fern Lake Fire was the work of careless individuals. Most likely campers let an illegal campfire get out of control. But science suggests our collective effort may have made it much worse. Last year was the hottest on record in the United States, and the fall weather was unseasonably warm in the Rockies. The forest was weakened by prolonged drought; that November was the driest ever recorded in the park. An epidemic of bark beetles, which thrive in warmer conditions, was already in the process of killing off thousands of trees. The area's first heavy snow came unusually late, in mid-December, and only then did the fire slow down. Jason Sibold, a geographer who studies forest fires at Colorado State University and who has spent time exploring the canyon where the fire started, says scientists can't say for sure that global warming was a direct cause. Pinning one extreme event to climate change is impossible to do. \"But that Forest Canyon site, I never thought I was going to see that burn, much less in December,\" he said. \"That's just shocking.\" Wildfires can be a good thing. They are nature's way of cleaning house -- clearing out old trees and underbrush and allowing new trees to grow and thrive. There hadn't been a fire in Forest Canyon in 800 years. In terms of number of fires, 2012 was a low in the U.S. But it was a record high for the number of acres burned: 9.2 million. Since 1960, when the National Interagency Fire Center began keeping records, only in 2006 and 2007 have more than 9 million acres of American land burned. In his inauguration speech this week, President Obama suggested climate change is largely to blame: \"Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.\" Like the hurricane season, statistics suggest the burn season is becoming longer and more severe. A recent study of fires on U.S. Forest Service land by Climate Central, a nonprofit research group that reports on the impacts of global warming, found \"the first wildfires of the year are starting earlier and the last fires of the year are starting later, making typical fire years 75 days longer now than they were 40 years ago.\" Compared to the 1970s, the number of fires covering more than 10,000 acres has increased sevenfold. At the same time, a study published in the science journal Nature  Climate Change  in September predicted that by the 2050s, forests will experience the worst droughts in 1,000 years. The result will likely be more fires, but also more beetles, and more trees that just can't stand the heat. Soon, the landscape of the American West may be unrecognizable. In some cases, trees will regrow, although probably in sparser patches. Some may be replaced by different species. But especially in drier, hotter areas like New Mexico and Arizona, the forests are on course to disappear altogether. \"We're seeing particularly here in the Southwest that we're not getting trees back in some of these spots,\" said Craig Allen, a New Mexico-based ecologist who studies landscape change. \"By mid-century, it's hard to see how the current dominant trees are going to be able to continue to grow in these sites. The climate will have changed too much.\" The Fern Lake Fire's destruction reached as far as Moraine Park, a grassy valley carved by glaciers that's a feeding ground for elk, a couple miles from the fire's origin and close enough to the nearby town of Estes Park that hundreds of people had to be evacuated from their homes. Now, blackened stalks stick up from patches of snow. In some spots the charred ground lies exposed to the sky. The fire torched the trunks of a grove of aspen trees already damaged by elk antlers (the elk have run rampant in the park since the decline of predators like wolves). The upper branches are unscathed, but it's unclear if the trees will survive. A trail at the end of the valley follows a swift mountain stream up to Fern Lake. It also passes the southern end of the canyon where the fire began, and is the likely route of the campers who started the blaze. On New Years Eve, the air was frigid and there were several inches of snow on the ground, but the smoke still lingered, making it more difficult to breathe in the thin air at more than 8,000 feet above sea level. After two miles, it was possible to see the bald patches on the mountains that mark the route the fire took. The fire began near the dense, wooded floor of Forest Canyon and blew to the top of the ridge. Then it went south, across the river and along another ridge to Moraine Park. Along its path, blackened, skeletal remains of pine trees stood silhouetted against the white snow. At first glance, it was hard to tell which trees were burnt and which were already dead from the beetles, which burrow into a tree and kill it from the inside out. A few trees were still sending plumes of white smoke into the air. A crew of four firefighters on staff with the national park had been dispatched to check on remaining hot spots. After hiking in to take a look, they said they weren't worried the fire would restart -- as long as it snows again soon. Maybe it will snow heavily this winter, and it's possible the fire was just a freak event. \"Cause and effect with global climate is hard. ... Change is a part of nature,\" said Ben Bobowski, the chief of resource stewardship for Rocky Mountain. But, he added, \"This has never happened in our history.\" It's the growing list of never-before-seen events like the Fern Lake Fire that's worrisome, and that has contributed to the consensus that humans, not nature, are behind the catastrophes. In New Mexico, a huge burn that destroyed more than 350 square miles of forests last summer was the largest in the state's history. In Australia, tens of thousands of acres are now burning in the wake of record-breaking temperatures. Beetles have consumed Western forests on an unprecedented scale. And a study co-authored by Craig Allen in 2010 found recent examples \"of extensive forest die\u2010off in all major forest types worldwide, from tropical rainforests in the Amazon to African savannas and Mediterranean pine forests to boreal forests in Canada and Alaska,\" all because of drought and heat potentially connected to the changing climate. Climate change can't take all the blame for the severity of the fires or the other problems forests are facing in the U.S. and around the world. But here at least, much of the blame can be pegged to other kinds of human activity. A bad year for fires in 1879 laid waste to huge swaths of American forest -- thanks to a drought, but also to the ongoing efforts of settlers burning off forest to make way for homes and agriculture. As Teddy Roosevelt put it several years later, when he was pushing for better conservation of the nation's natural resources, \"The time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests are gone.\" The trees grew back, but the destruction led to extensive areas predominated by same-age trees, which are now just the right size for a beetle attack, according to Sibold. In the 1900s, Americans swung in the opposite direction. They became overprotective of their forests and suppressed many fires, which allowed fuel to build up and made conditions ripe for more extreme burns now. The scientists don't like to characterize the changes to the Western scenery as \"bad.\" Many prefer to stay neutral with words like \"different\" and \"unique.\" But when pressed, they sound concerned, and gloomy. \"We haven't had landscapes like this,\" Sibold said. \"You have all of these things interacting, and it's generally not good news if you're a tree in Colorado.\"","headline":"How Climate Change Could Wipe Out the Western Forests","article_name":267457.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/01\/how-climate-change-could-wipe-out-the-western-forests\/267457\/","date_published":"2013-01-24 14:32:05","article_length":8528,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:48.442906","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/01\/how-climate-change-could-wipe-out-the-western-forests\/267457\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Nationwide forced isolation, along with media coverage of the pandemic\u2019s toll in U.S. jails and prisons, could shift public perceptions of carceral punishment. E arlier  this month , Ellen DeGeneres attracted public ire for something she said during the first \u201cat home\u201d edition of her show. Sitting in one of her palatial  houses , the 62-year-old comedian joked that self-isolation is \u201clike being in jail \u2026 mostly because I\u2019ve been wearing the same clothes for 10 days and everyone in here is gay.\u201d The video was removed from her YouTube channel following swift backlash , but DeGeneres isn\u2019t the only entertainer who has made glib remarks about quarantining during the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, the Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner told Conan O\u2019Brien that quarantine is \u201cprison\u201d for her husband, the singer Joe Jonas, because he\u2019s \u201ca real social butterfly.\u201d In some other climate, these hyperbolic comparisons might simply register as thoughtless. Now, after months  of  reports  chronicling  the  harrowing  conditions in jails and prisons, they come off as particularly callous. Being restricted from public gatherings may be frustrating, but even Turner and DeGeneres would admit that it\u2019s nothing like what correctional facilities face. In Colorado and Louisiana , Illinois and New York , incarcerated people are dying of the virus\u2014sometimes while handcuffed \u2014because jails and prisons are incompatible with the measures required to keep them safe. Social distancing is impossible. Even on a normal day, accessing medical care is a Sisyphean task. Crowded and unhygienic conditions are common. As a result, the infection rates in these institutions far outpace those of even the hardest-hit American cities. But although the oppressiveness of quarantine and the dangers of incarceration during a pandemic aren\u2019t the same, they\u2019re more related than many might think. The media have widely covered the devastating effects of COVID-19 in jails and prisons, as well as the risks that an outbreak among inmates poses to the surrounding communities . When taken alongside Americans\u2019 experiences with nationwide forced isolation, these facts could change how the public thinks of carceral punishment. Because the coronavirus\u2019s lethality is unprecedented, so, too, are the social-distancing and lockdown measures that are forcing many Americans to experience prolonged confinement for the first time. Following several years of slow, sometimes bipartisan, attempts to reform the criminal-justice system and its reliance on mass incarceration, these powerful new realities could challenge entrenched beliefs about the efficacy\u2014and ethics\u2014of sending people \u201caway.\u201d W hile  invoking prison to describe quarantining in one\u2019s own home is excessive, such comparisons are often rooted in a desire to express the real pains of isolation. Craig Haney, a psychology professor at UC Santa Cruz, and the author of Criminality in Context: The Psychological Foundations of Criminal Justice Reform , has spent much of his career studying the toll of mandatory social separation\u2014an experience that far more people are beginning to understand, in some small way. When we spoke, Haney emphasized that humans are both socialized and neurologically wired to connect with one another; being deprived of the opportunity to do so has profound consequences. When people complain about quarantine, Haney told me, they\u2019re often alluding to \u201cthe inconvenience of it: You can\u2019t go out to bars with your friends, you can\u2019t see your family, you can\u2019t go and do all the fun things.\u201d But, he said, \u201cin addition to being deprived of activities, we\u2019re being deprived of social contact , which is essential to our mental and physical well-being. It\u2019s almost like breathing. You have contact with people all the time, and you only notice it when you don\u2019t have it.\u201d Read: Why boredom affects us so much Even some formerly  incarcerated  people are drawing parallels between prison and quarantine, albeit in nuanced ways, referencing feelings of anxiety, a lack of control, and scarcity. \u201cAt one level, I think [the comparison] is pointing to how painful , actually, the deprivation of liberty can be,\u201d Bruce Western, a sociology professor at Columbia University, told me. \u201cWe can think about references to \u2018 country-club prisons \u2019 and so on, as if the deprivation of liberty was not a \u2018real\u2019 punishment. And now we\u2019re all sheltering inside and a lot of people are experiencing this as very, very difficult \u2026 But then, of course, the real conditions of incarceration regularly and routinely go well beyond the deprivation of liberty,\u201d he added. \u201cOn top of what sociologists have called \u2018the pains of imprisonment,\u2019 [incarcerated people are also] facing intense health risks now.\u201d (In addition, adequate psychological services are rarely available for the staggering population of mentally ill people who are routed into the criminal-justice system.) Of course, social distancing still allows for ample opportunities to connect with others remotely despite physical isolation. In jails and prisons, where visitors are always under heavy monitoring and virtual communication is prohibitively expensive , those options don\u2019t exist. June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, noted that the disappearance of normal social contact could be a chance for Americans to seriously consider the painful effects that more stringent measures have on incarcerated people: \u201cMaybe that gets us to rethink about the sheer number of people that we\u2019re incarcerating who have either a primary substance-use problem or a primary problem with mental illness,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd having experienced a little piece of [isolation] ourselves, maybe we\u2019ll be more sympathetic.\u201d I n  addition to undergoing quarantine, many Americans are coming to view incarceration through the lens of public health. Even before the virus spread across the country, professionals as disparate as doctors , activists , corrections officers , and health reporters were enumerating the ways that jail, prisons, and detention centers could play host to a \u201c public-health disaster .\u201d This framing acknowledges that inmates\u2019 well-being can directly affect those on the outside, which may prompt people to ask weighty ethical questions about how the penal system treats those behind bars: Does anyone deserve to die because they failed to report to their parole officer or were unable to pay a $500 bond? Does any crime justify a potentially painful, gasping death ? Such considerations are made more urgent by recent developments at jails and prisons. New York City\u2019s Hart Island has long been a public cemetery for the poor or unclaimed. But until earlier this month , the people digging the mass graves for virus victims were bused in from the Rikers Island jail; national media covered their macabre assignment. This burial practice was halted after officials decided that bus rides to Hart, during which inmates sat next to one another, presented too great a viral-transmission risk. (Scientists are still trying to determine whether COVID-19 can be spread by a dead body .) Barbara Bradley Hagerty: Innocent prisoners are going to die of the coronavirus That grim labor is just one element of the wide-ranging risks facing those incarcerated at Rikers, where the infection rate far outpaces that of New York City writ large. \u201cThe last couple of weeks have obviously pressed forward in a very hypercritical way the need for us to decarcerate our jails and prisons\u2014and [to] recognize that even before COVID, health and sanitary conditions in our jails and prisons were abysmal,\u201d says Tina Luongo, the attorney in charge of the criminal-defense practice at the Legal Aid Society in New York, which provides free representation to low-income people. \u201cThe fact that [incarcerated people] can\u2019t socially distance\u2014your bathroom facilities are shared by 20, 30 people \u2026 Your underlying vulnerabilities [had always been] present, but now they\u2019re life-threatening.\u201d In growing numbers, people not affiliated with traditional advocacy circles are calling for decarceration , whether through reducing jail and prison populations or easing punitive measures to protect public safety . A couple of weeks ago, dozens of doctors and public-health professionals sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanding decarceration and expanded access to health care for those who are released. Other doctors signed an open letter to death-penalty states asking them to relinquish the sedatives used during executions, because the supply needed to treat COVID-19 patients is rapidly dwindling . (The letter noted that medical professionals have long criticized states\u2019 practice of stockpiling such drugs, which weren\u2019t developed to help end lives.) These efforts join campaigns such as Free Them All for Public Health and Release Aging People in Prison , as well as writing from legal scholars and city officials , in framing decarceration as necessary for public health and safety. Though often aimed at achieving concrete goals rather than changing public opinion, these efforts may nonetheless sway newly attentive readers. Jails and prisons aren\u2019t self-contained entities. Though corrections officers are more protected than incarcerated people, they\u2019re at risk too, along with their families and communities. This month, on her free Apple TV+ show about COVID-19, Oprah Winfrey discussed the public-health need for criminal-justice reform, because infections inside prisons can find a way outside as well. \u201cThis is why people need to care,\u201d she said , pointing to that link. \u201c\u2019Cause I know a lot of people listen and they go, Well, they\u2019re in jail, and so forget about them .\u201d The coronavirus crisis has brought into sharp relief how interconnected we all are; it\u2019s never been clearer that the country\u2019s fate is bound up in that of its most vulnerable people. COVID-19 is disproportionately killing people in demographics already at greater risk for disease and criminalization: low-income communities , southerners , and black people . (These are also groups most likely to be targeted by discriminatory policing .) Fittingly, \u201c mutual aid \u201d networks, through which communities come together to share resources, have sprung up to address the needs of those hurt both within correctional institutions and outside them. Read: The emergency in Florida jails For the broader American public, the dismissal of incarcerated people\u2019s experiences has really begun shifting\u2014ever so slowly\u2014only in recent years, Haney said. In decades prior, most Americans weren\u2019t critical of such institutions, or of joking references to them. \u201cFrom the mid-1970s ... until I would say the early 2000s, there was really only one point of view about incarceration, which was The more of it, the better ,\u201d Haney said. People outside the system\u2019s grip had \u201cvery little awareness of the costs, even the economic costs but certainly not the psychological and the social costs.\u201d That began to change in the early aughts, first with more people expressing ambivalence toward the death penalty and then outright opposition to it. Noting that criminal-justice efforts have become ever more bipartisan, Haney said that he\u2019s seen \u201cpeople as different as Cory Booker and Newt Gingrich\u201d at related conferences. \u201cThere\u2019s now a different kind of awareness, an openness to thinking about incarceration in ways that we didn\u2019t before,\u201d he said. Consider, for example, the public response to DeGeneres\u2019s remarks about jail. As recently as the early 2000s or the \u201990s, \u201cpeople would've taken that as a joke and treated it as such,\u201d Luongo notes, adding that \u201cthe more we talk about the inhumanity of jails and prisons, the more people are becoming aware that that is not the answer.\u201d Some of that recent change in social attitudes is the direct result of various social movements , organizing campaigns , artistic productions , legal battles , and more, sometimes led by incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people. The pandemic, and its attendant social-distancing requirements, follows decades of efforts to shift public perceptions about criminal justice\u2014and the legal precedents that shape it. It\u2019s possible, then, that this widespread isolation might also contribute to different views. Those shifts likely won\u2019t result in the widespread belief that prisons be abolished altogether, and it remains reasonable to ask how we might protect society from grievous crimes. But reducing the country\u2019s reliance on incarceration can take many forms: Already, people new to the decarceration issue are calling for the \u201c compassionate release \u201d of elderly inmates, and those with serious health conditions, for whom COVID-19 would pose the greatest risk. Still others are decrying the institutions\u2019 usage of solitary confinement , sometimes even for children , to slow the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cOne of the things that has been so problematic about the era of mass incarceration is that, for most people, prison \u2026 is nothing more than an abstraction. It\u2019s a hidden world,\u201d Haney said. \u201cEven if you have a loved one in prison, it\u2019s not something you see directly \u2026 I\u2019ve always felt that legislatures who bandy about [sentences of] 10 years or 15 years or 20, who\u2019ve never spent a week in a penal institution, might have a very different perspective if indeed they experienced it directly.\u201d Quarantine, especially for financially stable households, isn\u2019t a direct counterpart to incarceration: On one side are people who find social distancing tedious or emotionally taxing, and on the other are those for whom the coronavirus is among the most deadly risks. As Western told me, the United States\u2019 response to the pandemic is \u201creally a story about inequality.\u201d Yet there\u2019s something cautiously optimistic about this moment, and what it means for how we all relate to one another. Or, as Haney said, \u201cThere\u2019s some reason to be hopeful that if people experience at least a tiny bit of what it is like \u2026 to have your day-to-day actions and interactions significantly restricted, that they might get some glimpse of what it is like to be incarcerated, what it is like for people whom we subject to much, much greater deprivations of liberty.

{"id":null,"body":"A new study suggests it's all in the wording Last September, the White House decided that it was going to phase out the use of the term \"global warming\" in favor of the even-clunkier \"global climate disruption.\" The thinking apparently went that \"warming\" was an oversimplification and the new term would be a catch-all for the entire scope of environmental changes occurring to the planet, not just greenhouse emissions and rising temperatures. The move, though well-intentioned, was quickly panned\u2014 especially by conservatives.  But, courtesy of recent research, we now know a much more agreeable term to conservatives: \"climate change.\" New research suggests that Republicans are far more likely to believe in the vaguer-sounding \"climate change\" than \"global warming.\" The findings, published in Public Opinion Quarterly , show a 60 percent to 44 percent gap among self-identified Republicans in a large survey who endorsed the notion of \"climate change\" versus \"global warming.\" Meaning that 16 percent of Republican respondents apparently weren't aware that \"climate change\" is synonymous with \"global warming.\"  Liberal-leaning respondents didn't have a similar problem in this sample size. Miller-McCune 's Tom Jacobs, who first reported the survey, notes that among Democratic respondents the difference was \"was nearly nonexistent, with 86.4 percent endorsing 'climate change and 86.9 percent acknowledging global warming.\" Researchers explained the results by noting that climate change \"lacks a directional commitment and easily accommodates unusual weather of any kind\" whereas \"global warming\" is a term that seems to be \"easily discredited by any cold spell.\"","headline":"Republicans Believe in 'Climate Change,' Not 'Global Warming'","article_name":348596.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2011\/03\/Republicans-believe-climate-change-not-global-warming\/348596\/","date_published":"2011-03-03 23:38:17","article_length":1674,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:49.765515","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2011\/03\/Republicans-believe-climate-change-not-global-warming\/348596\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The science of man-made global warming has only grown more conclusive. So why have Republicans become less convinced it\u2019s real over the past decade and a half? Denial of the broad scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause of global warming could become a guiding principle of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential administration. Though it\u2019s difficult to pin  down exactly what Trump thinks about climate change, he has a well-established track record of skepticism and denial. He has called global warming a \u201choax,\u201d insisted while campaigning for the Republican nomination that he\u2019s \u201cnot a big believer in man-made climate change,\u201d and recently suggested that \u201cnobody really knows\u201d if climate change exists. Trump also plans to nominate Republicans to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department who have expressed skepticism toward the scientific agreement on human-caused global warming. Indeed, Trump\u2019s election is a triumph of climate denial, and will elevate him to the top of a Republican Party where prominent elected officials have publicly  rejected the climate consensus. It\u2019s not that the presidential election was a referendum on global warming. Climate change barely came up during the presidential debates, and voters rated the environment as a far less pressing concern than issues like the economy, terrorism, and health care. But that relative lack of concern signals that voters have not prioritized action on climate change, if they want any action taken at all. Trump\u2019s victory sends a message that failing to embrace climate science still isn\u2019t disqualifying for a presidential candidate, even as scientists warn that the devastating consequences of global warming are under way and expected to intensify in the years ahead. If Trump fails to take climate change seriously, the federal government may do little to address the threat of a warming planet in the next four years. A presidential administration hostile to climate science also threatens to deepen, or at the very least prolong, the skepticism that already exists in American political life. \u201cIf the Trump administration continues to push the false claim that global warming is a hoax, not happening, not human caused, or not a serious problem, I\u2019d expect many conservative Republican voters to follow their lead,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of Yale University\u2019s Program on Climate Change Communication. The entrenchment of climate-science denial is one of the ways the United States appears to be exceptional relative to the rest of the world. A comparative 2015 study of nine conservative political parties in countries such as Canada, Germany, and Spain concluded that \u201cthe U.S. Republican Party is an anomaly in denying anthropogenic climate change.\u201d Meanwhile, Americans were least likely to agree that climate change is largely the result of human activity in a 2014 survey of 20 countries, including China, India, Australia, and Great Britain. Scientific reality does not seem to have escaped the distorting influence of political polarization in the United States. A paper published in Environment earlier this year suggests that as the Tea Party pushed the Republican Party further to the political right, it helped solidify skepticism of man-made climate change within the GOP. That happened as the Tea Party incorporated \u201canti-environmentalism and climate-change denial into its agenda,\u201d the authors write, and subsequently became part of a broader \u201cdenial countermovement\u201d made up of fossil-fuel companies as well as conservative think tanks and media outlets. As the ideological divide between Republicans and Democrats has widened , so has the partisan divide over climate change. Scientific evidence that human activity is the leading cause of global warming has continued to accumulate in recent years, and the evidence for man-made climate change is now overwhelming. In spite of that, Republicans are slightly less  convinced than they were a decade and a half ago that the Earth is getting warmer as a result of human activity. Democrats have moved in the opposite direction and become more likely to say that man-made climate change is real. This year, Gallup found that while 85 percent of Democrats believe human activity has lead to higher temperatures, only 38 percent of Republicans agree. In a deeply divided country, adopting views on climate change that conflict with scientific evidence can actually be a rational choice. Liberals and conservatives frequently spend time with like-minded individuals, and people across the political spectrum may have a better chance of fitting in if they embrace shared partisan beliefs\u2014regardless of whether those beliefs contradict scientific fact. This helps explain why highly educated Republicans are actually more likely to reject climate science. Yale University professor Dan Kahan put it this way in a 2012 Nature article : For members of the public, being right or wrong about climate-change science will have no impact. Nothing they do as individual consumers or individual voters will meaningfully affect the risks posed by climate change. Yet the impact of taking a position that conflicts with their cultural group could be disastrous. \u2026 Positions on climate change have come to signify the kind of person one is. People whose beliefs are at odds with those of the people with whom they share their basic cultural commitments risk being labelled as weird and obnoxious in the eyes of those on whom they depend for social and financial support. The complexity of climate science may have made it easier for global warming to get caught up in partisan politics as well. Voters look to the positions adopted by their political party as a kind of mental shortcut when deciding what to make of complicated subjects such as climate change, according to research from Cynthia Rugeley of the University of Minnesota, Duluth, and John David Gerlach of Western Carolina University. That means that if Trump continues to voice climate skepticism after taking office, he could further cement skepticism among conservative voters. \u201cI think it will reinforce climate denial among those who already doubt its existence. To that extent, yes, it will deepen denial,\u201d Rugeley said in an interview. The power and influence of corporations relative to the government might also help explain why skepticism has thrived. An ideological preference for free markets may make some politicians and voters in the United States more sympathetic to arguments that environmental regulations will hurt the private sector\u2014even if those arguments are used to dismiss climate science. According to Matthew Paterson, a professor of international politics at the University of Manchester in England, skepticism over government intervention might help explain why climate skepticism also seems relatively entrenched in Anglo-Saxon countries such as Great Britain and Australia, though to lesser degrees there than in the United States. Fossil-fuel interests, in particular, have managed to inject doubt into the climate debate in the United States, Paterson argues, by \u201cfunding deniers, and anti-climate politicians, and giving them a public voice.\u201d The more voters are skeptical of man-made climate change, the easier it may be for politicians to justify inaction. It\u2019s impossible to predict what Trump will do in office, but he already appears poised to dismantle President Obama\u2019s agenda to combat climate change. He also seems willing to fill his administration with individuals who have cast doubt on the scientific consensus. Trump wants Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to serve as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt recently co- wrote an article claiming that scientists \u201cdisagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\u201d Trump\u2019s choice to run the Energy Department, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, has claimed \u201cthe science is not settled\u201d on climate change. And his pick to lead the Interior Department is Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, who has reportedly said that global warming is \u201cnot a hoax, but it\u2019s not proven science either.\u201d Despite significant pockets of skepticism and denial, particularly among conservative Republicans , there are plenty of Americans across the political spectrum who believe that man-made climate change exists. Gallup recently found that a majority of Americans believe human activity is causing global warming, and feel worried about the rise in temperatures. Concern over climate change increased among Democrats and Republicans from 2015 to 2016 with 40 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats reporting concern this year. If that concern continues to increase, skepticism may decline over time among American voters. Whether skepticism dissipates or intensifies may depend in part on the actions of the Trump administration over the next four years. If Trump makes climate science and policy a high-profile target, he might provoke a backlash among moderate Republicans who do believe global warming is a serious problem. But skepticism within the GOP could intensify if Trump\u2019s administration publicly misrepresents climate science and dismisses efforts to combat global warming as an expensive waste of time. If that happens, Democrats and liberal activists will counterattack, a dynamic that might cause partisan attitudes to harden further. That could leave the political debate over global warming more fractured than ever.","headline":"Donald Trump and the Triumph of Climate Denial","article_name":510359.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2016\/12\/donald-trump-climate-change-skeptic-denial\/510359\/","date_published":"2016-12-25 09:50:00","article_length":9562,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:50.361090","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2016\/12\/donald-trump-climate-change-skeptic-denial\/510359\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Could bears hold the key to better treatments for stroke, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s? This article was originally published by Knowable Magazine . Every spring, as days in the north stretch longer and melting snow trickles into streams, drowsy animals ranging from grizzlies to ground squirrels start to rally from hibernation. It\u2019s tempting to say that they are \u201cwaking up,\u201d but hibernation is more complicated and mysterious than a simple long sleep : Any animal that can spend months underground without eating or drinking and still emerge ready to face the world has clearly mastered an amazing trick of biology. The roster of animals that hibernate includes all manner of rodents, some amphibians, and even a few primates (several species of dwarf lemurs), but bears are literally the biggest hibernators of them all. Adult grizzly and black bears outweigh even the largest American football players, and have the energy and curiosity of preschoolers, but they have no trouble hunkering down for months at a time. The choreography that goes into shutting down a creature this big defies easy explanation, says Elena Gracheva, a neurophysiologist at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cHibernation is so complex, it requires adaptations at multiple levels,\u201d she says. Bear hibernation offers important insights into the workings of large mammals, especially us, explains Gracheva, who co-authored an exploration of the physiology of hibernation in the 2020 Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology . A better understanding of the process could potentially change our approach to a wide range of human conditions, including stroke, osteoporosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s . Read: The grizzlies are coming Bears, too, will have to rethink their concept of hibernation as the climate warms and winters grow shorter. How they respond will say much about their commitment to winter naps, and about the deep interconnections between climate and animal behavior. Bears take an approach to hibernation that\u2019s far different from other slumberers\u2019. Arctic ground squirrels can temporarily drop their body temperature to \u20133 degrees Celsius (27 degrees Fahrenheit) without freezing solid. Bears, in contrast, lose hardly any heat at all in their winter dens, but they still qualify as hibernators, the scientists I spoke with said, because their metabolism slows to a crawl. The process is one that Brian Barnes, a zoologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and his colleagues carefully tracked more than a decade ago by studying black bears hibernating in artificial dens . The winter quarters were actually chambers that could gauge oxygen intake and carbon-dioxide production, important measures of metabolism, while sensors tracked body temperature. The study was the first to definitively show that animals could hibernate without cooling down. Still, hibernating bears aren\u2019t just resting away the winter, Barnes says. They truly shut down, completely resetting the parameters of their daily lives. \u201cThey go in, turn around two or three times, lie down, and they stay that way for six months,\u201d he says; they get up only to switch sides every few days. \u201cHibernation defines the outer limits of what\u2019s possible in terms of mammalian function.\u201d Barnes notes that sow bears often nurse twins or triplets during hibernation without eating or drinking, tapping into their own fat and water stores for the sake of their cubs. Read: Weighing a fat bear is a great idea until you actually do it For humans, that level of lethargy would come at a cost. Whether we were recovering in a hospital bed or riding a rocket to Mars, our muscles would wither and our bones would thin after months of inactivity. Bears have no such problem. Part of the secret to their strong bones is just now coming to light. In 2021, Barnes and his colleagues published a study showing that hibernating bears are able to shut down genes involved in the breakdown of bone . The researchers suggest that it might someday be possible to manipulate the same process in people to prevent osteoporosis. Barnes adds that such an approach could be especially helpful for people confined to extended bed rest, the closest humans currently get to hibernating. The sluggish metabolism of hibernating bears is an amazing feat in itself. A bear can slow its breathing and heart rate by about 75 percent for months at a time while maintaining a comparatively high body temperature. Although nobody knows exactly how they put on the metabolic brakes, Gracheva says the strategy makes good sense. She suspects that bears don\u2019t chill out like ground squirrels because it would take far too much energy to rewarm their large bodies in the spring. Instead, they curl up, letting their fat and fur keep them warm with just a few occasional shivers to help keep blood moving. The mastery of near-suspended animation by human-size (or bigger) animals has caught the attention of science-fiction writers and others who dream of someday being able to send astronauts around the solar system as they \u201chibernate\u201d away the months or years on limited oxygen, food, and exercise. More immediately, it might be possible to use the lessons of hibernation to protect people in intensive care. Read: Grizzly bears have a human problem As Barnes explains, heart attacks and strokes greatly reduce the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. That lack of supply would be much less damaging if doctors could rapidly reduce the demand by putting a patient in a state of hibernation, or something like it. Barnes notes that stroke victims are most likely to benefit from treatment in the first hour after the stroke. Doctors call their window of opportunity to restore blood flow the \u201cgolden hour.\u201d If doctors could replicate hibernation to a point at which the brain\u2019s needs don\u2019t outstrip supply, \u201cthat golden hour could be a golden week or three weeks,\u201d Barnes says. The speculation may soon be over: In March 2021, researchers in the United States and China, inspired by the hibernators of the animal world, proposed a study that would use a combination of the sedative drug promethazine and the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine to temporarily create a \u201chibernation-like state\u201d in stroke patients, with the ultimate goal of preserving brain function. Bear hibernation stands apart in other ways. Some rodents and other animals hibernate on strict schedules governed by day length. Bears, however, decide for themselves when to shut down and when to recover, explains Heather Johnson, a research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Anchorage, Alaska. That timing is driven by a number of cues, including food supply and, importantly, temperature. In a study published in 2017, Johnson and her colleagues tracked the hibernation of 51 female black bears for an average of three winters each in the vicinity of Durango, Colorado. The total length of hibernation varied widely, from less than four months to more than seven months, depending on age and parental status. Older bears and mothers with cubs tended to hunker down longer than younger bears that were on their own. But all of the bears were clearly paying attention to the weather as they prepared to return to active life. On average, bears left their dens three and a half days earlier for every rise of 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the average minimum temperature in spring. \u201cWhen a temperature gets to a certain level, that\u2019s their cue that it\u2019s time to come out of hibernation,\u201d Johnson says. Likewise, brown bears in Scandinavia seem to wait for the temperature to reach a threshold before emerging from their winter dens, says Alina Evans, a wildlife veterinarian at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences in Evenstad. In a study published in 2016, Evans and her colleagues followed the hibernation routines of 14 bears that had been fitted with satellite collars and monitors that tracked heart rate and body temperature. The bears chose different times and places (tree roots, caves, dug-out ant hills) to start denning, but they all left their dens when the average daytime temperature approached 5 degrees Celsius (about 40 degrees Fahrenheit). Evans thinks that temperature is what coaxes them to come out, but adds that there are other possibilities. Bears may also pay attention to unpleasant wetness from melting snow, for example. As winters grow milder in a warming climate, bears will undoubtedly start emerging from their dens earlier, Johnson says. It\u2019s hard to say whether such shifts have already happened, but, anecdotally, there are many stories of bears that show up in towns or on cabin porches during a winter warm spell. She worries that shorter hibernation periods could give bears more time to get into trouble. Bears that emerge early from dens have more chances to tip over garbage cans, get hit by cars, or end up in the crosshairs of a hunter. \u201cBears have a pretty much 100 percent survival rate while they\u2019re hibernating,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s a dangerous world for them.\u201d Bears generally time their hibernation so that they\u2019re bedded down when food is scarce but are active during times of plenty, Evans says. She\u2019s concerned that changing temperatures could throw off that schedule. In theory, an early warm spell could drive bears out of the den sooner than usual, only for them to be plunged back into the cold when they\u2019ve already started losing winter weight. \u201cThey may be missing an opportunity to save energy in a harsh environment,\u201d she says. In some cases, a sudden change in climate could temporarily turn bears into overeaters, Gracheva says. Typically, a bear will lose as much as 30 to 40 percent of its body weight\u2014mostly fat\u2014during hibernation. If a bear wakes up early several years in a row, all those spring meals could add unwanted pounds. \u201cThe bear could become obese,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could become susceptible to diabetes in the way that we are.\u201d But in the long term, bears will eventually be able to adjust their eating and hibernation schedules to fit into a warming world, Evans says. After all, she notes, black bears thrive in the swamps of Florida and the woodlands of Mexico, and brown bears have a foothold in southern European countries where harsh winters mostly went away with the Ice Age. Some bears in warmer climes have decided to skip hibernation entirely. Bears in Greece and Croatia may not den at all unless they are pregnant, Evans says. Hibernation may be less urgent in a warming world, but scientists are no less interested in what the process can teach us.","headline":"What Humans Can Learn From Nature\u2019s Biggest Hibernators","article_name":629520.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/climate-change-bears-hibernation\/629520\/","date_published":"2022-04-10 12:00:00","article_length":10613,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:50.590300","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/climate-change-bears-hibernation\/629520\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The field has a \u201cdata gap\u201d problem that won\u2019t be easy to solve. It\u2019s easy to talk about how climate change will alter Earth\u2019s surface in the century to come. It will raise sea levels, flood cities, and set off droughts. As this month\u2019s dire United Nations report shows, decades of climate science have made the worldwide dangers of human-caused warming unambiguous. Yet it\u2019s far harder to talk about how these changes will play out locally. No two places will experience climate change identically: The coasts of Borneo and the shores of Great Britain, for example, will see the land and weather transform in vastly different ways. But people living in the United Kingdom have a far better idea of what those changes will look like. Call it climate science\u2019s data gap. When studying the Earth\u2019s climate, researchers must understand the past before they can understand the future. But across huge swaths of the world, scientists simply don\u2019t have the data they need\u2014especially the kind of in-depth, long-term observations that can place current weather in context\u2014to understand that past. These problems are particularly acute for countries in the global South. In 2015, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected how climate change would affect temperature and precipitation values on each continent. In Africa, Asia, and South America, it rated more than 40 percent of its own predictions to be \u201clow confidence.\u201d In Europe and Australia, by contrast, only about 12 percent of its projections were of low confidence. \u201cThere\u2019s essentially an order-of-magnitude difference in the amount of science available across regions of the world,\u201d says Katharine Mach , a senior climate researcher at Stanford University and one of the authors of the IPCC report. She pointed out that the IPCC spent as much time and energy writing a chapter on Australia and New Zealand as it did for the entirety of Asia. \u201cIf you were to take the 8,000 studies relevant to climate change in Asia, and the 3,000 for [Australia and New Zealand], and if you were to do publications per person [living in those places], obviously the number would look starkly different,\u201d she told me. The most recent IPCC report , released earlier this month, only focused on how the Earth overall would be affected by 1.5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise and did not produce continent-specific chapters. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report At least 60 years\u2019 worth of data might be needed to draw meaningful observations about temperature or precipitation trends, says Edvin Aldrian , a climate scientist for the Indonesian government who is currently on the IPCC. For parts of his home country, Aldrian says data is scattered at best. In some cases, it might not exist. Aldrian argues that the IPCC\u2019s methods required a good base of historical data about a country. Without a solid grasp of the baseline science, it becomes difficult to propose effective strategies for communities facing the consequences of climate change, like crop failures due to shifting rain patterns. It also makes it harder to understand what\u2019s happening now. In much of the global North, researchers are already documenting changes that seem influenced by climate change. Most regions in North America and Europe have experienced a documented increase in hot days and a decrease in cooler days since the 1950s, for example. Based on that data, climate models can predict with high confidence that countries in northern Europe will \u201cvery likely\u201d see an increase in hot days in the future, along with more intense precipitation in the winter months, and perhaps won\u2019t experience major changes in drought conditions. But across broad swaths of Africa, Asia, and South America, that kind of accounting isn\u2019t possible. In East Africa, for instance, there isn\u2019t even enough published scientific literature to say whether temperatures have shifted since the 1950s. The same goes for precipitation changes. When the IPCC mapped how rainfall amounts had changed from 1951 to 2010, North America and Europe were clearly shaded in a color gradient showing increases or decreases in rainfall. But almost all of central Africa, as well as patches of Asia and South America, had to be left blank due to insufficient data: There\u2019s a reason for this data gap: The majority of the studies analyzed or evaluated by the IPCC concerned North America and Europe. The report summarized more than 10,000 studies about Europe, but only 2,982 about Africa. This effect isn\u2019t just dependent on southernness, but on historical affluence. Though Australia is roughly half the size of South America, the former contributed about 1,000 more studies to the IPCC report. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got 10,000 available studies on the issues versus 3,000, you\u2019re actually able to say much more rigorously and specifically that tons of impacts are happening in Europe, whereas the evidence is a lot scarcer in [other parts of the world],\u201d Mach told me. The IPCC\u2019s models do extrapolate and fill in all areas of the globe with predictions for changes in precipitation and temperature, she added. But those conclusions might not be as accurate or nuanced for regions with less historical data to begin with. This effect is particularly troublesome when dealing with a complex ecosystem like the Sahara, which expands and contracts seasonally due to natural variations in ocean currents. It can become difficult, if not impossible, to understand that unique region by tracing back rainfall and weather records more than a few decades, and it can pose a problem to isolating short-term patterns from long-term climate trends. The catalog of places that suffer worst from the climate data gap is not entirely arbitrary. Despite sharing a history of colonization by Europeans, for example, the Indian subcontinent tends to have much better records than Africa. \u201cIt mattered to [the British empire] that they had good data\u201d from India, says Amir Jina, an environmental and developmental economist at the University of Chicago. \u201cBecause agricultural products were such a big component of the income from [the colony], weather data was very important. So the British put in place this data-collection infrastructure in their colonies.\u201d Of course, this did not make the British any better stewards of the continent. Colonial officials may have implemented the scientific apparatus to collect weather data and crop records, but they still sought environmental and social control over India. Their bounty of data did not stop them from acting to the deliberate detriment of locals , exporting millions of pounds of rice out of the colony during periods of famine. \u201cA lot of places in sub-Saharan Africa, it\u2019s the opposite story,\u201d Jina told me. \u201c[Some of the continent] was colonized during the scramble for Africa\u2014and so it mattered that colonial officials knew where gold was or the mines were to extract it,\u201d but not so much that they monitored fluctuations in the weather. Collecting good data is also expensive, particularly if the country in question lacks financial and institutional resources, Jina added. In some cases, the historical gaps in climate data and the infrastructure to collect it can be made up for by technological advances and international scientific projects. Satellites, for instance, can produce high-resolution images and temperature and precipitation records for most places on Earth. But just because this data exists, climate scientists don\u2019t automatically have access to it. Take the situation in the world-famous, ecologically diverse, and climatically vital Himalayas. In 2012, Kamal Bawa, a conservation biologist at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, used satellite imagery to track changes in temperature, rainfall, and vegetation patterns in the Himalayas. The study was one of the first large-scale climatic analyses for the region, and it states that the Himalayas have already experienced at least 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming on average over the past 25 years. Bawa told me that it can be difficult for researchers to navigate the politics of the mountains, which straddle Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China. There\u2019s also a lack of funding, institutional resources, and international attention to a region that is particularly vulnerable to climate change both ecologically and socially. In some cases, the best data just come from asking around. In a 2011 study , Bawa and his colleagues assessed how local villagers understood the changes in the landscape\u2019s weather patterns and vegetation. \u201cWhen you go to the villages, people are talking about weather all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir daily activity is defined by what\u2019s going to happen in the next two hours. \u2018When is the rain going to end so we can do our chores?\u2019 That\u2019s a constant discussion.\u201d In other cases, they\u2019ve just had to estimate. Jina and a team of researchers at the University of Chicago recently released a paper that models heat-related deaths in future climate scenarios. First, the team compiled one of the most comprehensive data sets to date on mortality: It covers 56 percent of the global population. But this still left the other 44 percent to be filled in with a supercomputer model. \u201cIf we had data on 1 percent of the world, we could extrapolate out and say we had information on 100 percent of the world,\u201d Jina said. \u201cBut the accuracy of that is open to question.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this quote that I really love from Galileo that really describes science in a nutshell: \u2018Measure what you can measure and make measurable what you can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are things which are very easy to measure for social and historical and other reasons, but as researchers, we\u2019re not doing as well at measuring new things and new places. That\u2019s an embedded problem in science and history\u2014but usually it\u2019s the most vulnerable people being written out of all the knowledge we\u2019re generating. And I think that\u2019s an enormous problem.\u201d","headline":"For Some Poor Countries, Climate Science Comes Too Late","article_name":569458.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/why-climate-science-cant-help-some-poor-countries-un-ipcc\/569458\/","date_published":"2018-10-15 16:40:13","article_length":9961,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:51.583662","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/why-climate-science-cant-help-some-poor-countries-un-ipcc\/569458\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"With one dietary change, the U.S. could almost meet greenhouse-gas emission goals. Ecoanxiety is an emerging condition. Named in 2011, the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with \u201cwatching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold, and worrying about the future for oneself, children, and later generations.\u201d It\u2019s not a formal diagnosis. Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is real, as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body. This sort of disposition toward ecological-based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety. Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of \u201cthe Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord, and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency. For people who experience climate-related anxiety, this all serves as a sort of exacerbation by presidential gaslight. The remedy for a condition like this is knowing what can be done to mitigate environmental degradation, from within in a country singularly committed to it . Like what? Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She\u2019s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food. Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that\u2014hypothetically\u2014the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals , pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009. That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed\u2014and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese\u2014this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target. \u201cI think there\u2019s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,\u201d Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person\u2019s dedication to the cause doesn\u2019t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact\u2014more so than downsizing one\u2019s car , or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering . Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people. This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world\u2019s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations , 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products. This means much less deforestation and land degradation if so many plant crops weren\u2019t run through the digestive tracts of cattle. If Americans traded their beef for beans, the researchers found, that would free up 42 percent of U.S. crop land. \u201cThe real beauty of this kind of thing is that climate impact doesn\u2019t have to be policy-driven,\u201d said Harwatt. \u201cIt can just be a positive, empowering thing for consumers to see that they can make a significant impact by doing something as simple as eating beans instead of beef.\u201d She and her colleagues conclude in the journal Climatic Change : \u201cWhile not currently recognized as a climate policy option, the \u2018beans for beef\u2019 scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts.\u201d The beans for beef scenario is, it seems, upon us. \u201cI think it\u2019s such an easy-to-grasp concept that it could be less challenging than a whole dietary shift,\u201d said Harwatt. The words vegetarian and vegan have stifled some people\u2019s thinking on what it means to eat well\u2014to consume responsibly, conscientiously. Rather the beans for beef scenario is the dietary equivalent of effective altruism \u2014focusing on where efforts will have the highest yield. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a worst-first approach, looking at the hottest spot in the food system in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, and what could that be substituted with without losing protein and calories in the food system? And at the same time, gaining health benefits.\u201d In addition to the well-documented health benefits of a plant-based diet, this case also brings empowerment, or at least reprieve. Regardless of a person\u2019s degree of ecoanxiety, there is some recourse in knowing how far individuals can go to make up for a regressive federal administration simply by eating beans.","headline":"If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef","article_name":535536.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2017\/08\/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef\/535536\/","date_published":"2017-08-02 08:30:00","article_length":6321,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:52.046550","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2017\/08\/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef\/535536\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cThe human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.\u201d Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. \u201cLocal rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,\u201d said a statement from the National Weather Service. \u201cCatastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.\u201d (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people\u2014and perhaps tens of thousands of people\u2014are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey\u2014and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide\u2014suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun\u2019s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. As the world warms, evaporation speeds up. So on avg there's more water vapour for a storm to sweep up & dump now, compared to 70 years ago. https:\/\/t.co\/M4R9OFFZt9 This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change\u2019s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea\u2019s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average . These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world . The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. \u201cThis is the main fuel for the storm,\u201d says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. \u201cAlthough these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].\u201d This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey\u2019s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall . Why do storms normally weaken\u2014and why didn\u2019t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn\u2019t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm\u2014meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. \u201cHarvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It\u2019s amazing it was able to do that,\u201d he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. \u201cThe human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway\u2014but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.\u201d More generally, it\u2019s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that human activities \u201chave contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.\u201d Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus . The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented\u2014just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area\u2019s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.","headline":"Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey?

{"id":null,"body":"Even as the country fights bushfires, it can\u2019t stop dumping planet-warming pollution into the atmosphere. Updated 3:00 p.m. ET on Jan. 4, 2020. Australia is caught in a climate spiral. For the past few decades, the arid and affluent country of 25 million has padded out its economy\u2014otherwise dominated by sandy beaches and a bustling service sector\u2014by selling coal to the world. As the East Asian economies have grown, Australia has been all too happy to keep their lights on. Exporting food, fiber, and minerals to Asia has helped Australia achieve three decades of nearly relentless growth: Oz has not had a technical recession, defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction, since July 1991. But now Australia is buckling under the conditions that its fossil fuels have helped bring about. Perhaps the two biggest kinds of climate calamity happening today have begun to afflict the continent. The first kind of disaster is, of course, the wildfire crisis. In the past three months, bushfires in Australia\u2019s southeast have burned millions of acres, poisoned the air in Sydney and Melbourne, and forced 4,000 tourists and residents in a small beach town, Mallacoota, to congregate on the beach and get evacuated by the navy. A salvo of fires seems to have caught the world\u2019s attention in recent years. But the current Australian season has outdone them all: Over the past six months, Australian fires have burned more than twice the area than was consumed, combined, by California\u2019s 2018 fires and the Amazon\u2019s 2019 fires. Read: The Amazon cannot be recovered once it\u2019s gone The second is the irreversible scouring of the Earth\u2019s most distinctive ecosystems. In Australia, this phenomenon has come for the country\u2019s natural wonder, the Great Barrier Reef. From 2016 to 2018, half of all coral in the reef died , killed by oceanic heat waves that bleached and then essentially starved the symbiotic animals. Because tropical coral reefs take about a decade to recover from such a die-off, and because the relentless pace of climate change means that more heat waves are virtually guaranteed in the 2020s, the reef\u2019s only hope of long-term survival is for humans to virtually halt global warming in the next several decades and then begin to reverse it. Meeting such a goal will require a revolution in the global energy system\u2014and, above all, a rapid abandonment of coal burning. But there\u2019s the rub. Australia is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coal power, and it has avoided recession for the past 27 years in part by selling coal. Though polls report that most Australians are concerned about climate change, the country\u2019s government has so far been unable to pass pretty much any climate policy. In fact, one of its recent political crises\u2014the ousting of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the summer of 2018\u2014was prompted by Turnbull\u2019s attempt to pass an energy bill that included climate policy. Its current prime minister, Scott Morrison, actually brought a lump of coal to the floor of Parliament several years ago while defending the industry. He won an election last year by depicting climate change as the exclusive concern of educated city-dwellers , and climate policy as a threat to Australians\u2019 cars and trucks. He has so far attempted to portray the wildfires as a crisis, sure, but one in line with previous natural disasters. Read: Five big trends that increased Earth\u2019s carbon pollution In fact, it is unprecedented. This season\u2019s fires have incinerated more than 1,500 homes and have killed at least 23 people, Prime Minister Morrison said on Saturday . * There were at least twice as many fires in New South Wales in 2019 as there were in any other year this century, according to an analysis by The New York Times . Climate change likely intensified the ongoing epidemic: Hotter and drier weather makes wildfires more common, and climate change is increasing the likelihood of both in Australia. Last year was both the hottest and driest year on record in the country. Perhaps more than any other wealthy nation on Earth, Australia is at risk from the dangers of climate change. It has spent most of the 21st century in a historic drought. Its tropical oceans are more endangered than any other biome by climate change. Its people are clustered along the temperate and tropical coasts, where rising seas threaten major cities. Those same bands of livable land are the places either now burning or at heightened risk of bushfire in the future. Faced with such geographical challenges, Australia\u2019s people might rally to reverse these dangers. Instead, they have elected leaders with other priorities. Australia will continue to burn, and its coral will continue to die. Perhaps this episode will prompt the more pro-carbon members of Australia\u2019s Parliament to accede to some climate policy. Or perhaps Prime Minister Morrison will distract from any link between the disaster and climate change, as President Donald Trump did when he inexplicably blamed California\u2019s 2018 blazes on the state\u2019s failure to rake forest floors. Perhaps blazes will push Australia\u2019s politics in an even more besieged and retrograde direction, empowering politicians like Morrison to fight any change at all. And so maybe Australia will find itself stuck in the climate spiral, clinging ever more tightly to coal as its towns and cities choke on the ash of a burning world. * This story originally misstated that at least 18 firefighters had died this fire season. In an earlier estimate, 18 people in total had been confirmed dead; three of them were volunteer firefighters.","headline":"Australia Will Lose to Climate Change","article_name":604423.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/australia-caught-climate-spiral\/604423\/","date_published":"2020-01-04 12:00:00","article_length":5591,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:53.812304","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/australia-caught-climate-spiral\/604423\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Global warming will intensify regional inequality in the United States, according to a revolutionary new economic assessment of the phenomenon. Climate change will aggravate economic inequality in the United States, essentially transferring wealth from poor counties in the Southeast and the Midwest to well-off communities in the Northeast and on the coasts, according to the most detailed economic assessment of the phenomenon ever conducted. The study, published Thursday in Science , simulates the costs of global warming in excruciating detail, modeling every day of weather in every U.S. county during the 21st century. It finds enormous disparities in how rising temperatures will affect American communities: Texas, Florida, and the Deep South will bleed income in the broiling heat, while some chillier northern states gain moderate benefits. \u201cWe are really sure the South is going to get hammered,\u201d says Solomon Hsiang, one of the authors of the paper and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe South is really, really negatively affected by climate change, much more so than the North. That wasn\u2019t something we were expecting going in.\u201d Overall, the paper finds that climate change will cost the United States 1.2 percent of its GDP for every additional degree Celsius of warming, though that figure is somewhat uncertain. If global temperatures rise by four degrees Celsius by 2100\u2014which is very roughly where the current terms of the Paris Agreement would put the planet\u2014U.S. GDP could shrink anywhere between 1.6 and 5.6 percent. Yet beyond its initial findings, the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics. Previously, the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once. This new study worked from the bottom up, building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States. Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real-world data. \u201cThis is like the adults entering the room. Economists have, for a quarter century, insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages. This team has done so,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. He was not connected to the study. But this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change\u2014even those the researchers considered important\u2014if the data describing them was too paltry. The estimates do not include \u201cnon-market goods\u201d like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor. In other words: Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost, but there\u2019s no consensus on how to approximate it. The study also doesn\u2019t account for the increased likelihood of \u201ctail risks\u201d\u2014that is, unlikely events with catastrophic consequences. Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife, mass migration, or global military calamity more likely, but those events are, by definition, hard to predict. The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a \u201cmega-drought\u201d or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet . \u201cWhen we had the Dust Bowl, we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast,\u201d said Hsiang. Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study. All in all, the study\u2019s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a \u201cnormal\u201d world. It describes an America that has retained a well-organized economy, held together as a political community, and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago. Even in that harmonious world, climate change will make the United States pay. Across the country\u2019s southern half\u2014and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico\u2014climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20-percent tax on county-level income, according to the study. Harvests will dwindle, summer energy costs will soar, rising seas will erase real-estate holdings, and heatwaves will set off epidemics of cardiac and pulmonary disease. The loss of human life dwarfs all the other economic costs of climate change. Almost every county between El Paso, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, could see their mortality rate rise by more than 20 people out of every 100,000. By comparison, car accidents killed about 11 Americans out of every 100,000 in 2015. But in the South and Southwest, other damages stack up. Some counties in eastern Texas could see agricultural yields fall by more than 50 percent. West Texas and Arizona may see energy costs rise by 20 percent. Simultaneously, the study finds that some regions may reap moderate economic benefits from global warming. New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Lake states may all prosper as growing seasons lengthen, and the number of frigid, deadly winter days decrease. In the most optimistic scenarios, some counties could see their incomes rise by 10 percent by the middle of the century. This may make some Americans scratch their heads. The high costs of climate change will fall on many of the places where people today seem least worried about the phenomenon. \u201cMost of the risk maps show that climate change is going to be terrible for Trump country. Like, it\u2019s not clear at all\u2014from these maps\u2014why reducing climate change is not a more urgent issue for Republicans, purely as a matter of representing their people,\u201d said Joseph Majkut, the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, in an email. He was not connected to the study. Hsiang explained the disparity as a consequence of the hot places getting hotter.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re in a hot location already, then increasing the temperature tends to be much more damaging than if you\u2019re somewhere that is cooler. Moving from 70 to 75 [degrees Fahrenheit] is not as big a deal as going from 90 to 95,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe South, today, is already very hot. So as the country warms up, the South is disproportionately bearing the burden.\u201d In fact, the only factor of climate change that doesn\u2019t specifically hurt the South is a projected rise in property crime associated with climate change. The incidence of nonviolent property crime doesn\u2019t rise on summer days, but it tends to fall on the coldest days. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to burgle houses or steal cars when there\u2019s a lot of snow on the ground,\u201d said Hsiang, laughing. As the North\u2019s winters get less icy, the region will see property-crime rates increase. But scorching summer days won\u2019t alter the South\u2019s crime rates. This is, however, a very small factor, Hsiang cautioned. He also warned that the paper\u2019s economic projections end in 2099. If climate change continues unabated into the 22nd century, the North will likely eventually \u201cflip over\u201d into much higher temperatures and more severe economic damages, Hsiang said. The Science paper is the first product of the Climate Impact Lab , a 25-person consortium of economists and policy experts led by researchers from the University of California, the University of Chicago, Rutgers University, and the Rhodium Group. This study is the first part of their new global assessment of the economic costs of human-caused climate change. \u201cWhat has happened over the last 10 years is there\u2019s been a revolution in our ability to measure the relationship between the climate and the economy, partly out of new, real-world data,\u201d Hsiang told me. \u201cThis paper somewhat came out of the realization that all that new research wasn\u2019t going anywhere. It wasn\u2019t informing how we think about climate and the economy because those older models weren\u2019t built in a way to absorb new findings.\u201d Their new program is called SEAGLAS. It\u2019s designed to integrate new research into the regional and local effects of policy into a larger, holistic view of a certain country or part of the world. So while this study focused on U.S. county-level data about crime, human health, agriculture, labor supply, and energy demand, the researchers intend to fold new sectors and data sources into it in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s a great development, and the future of climate economics,\u201d said Majkut. \u201cThis new study puts us on much more satisfying empirical ground as we consider the relationships between climate change and economic output. For that alone it should be praised.\u201d He did question one of the assumptions underlying the project: whether previously observed relationships will continue to hold in a future world. \u201cIf the high rates of human mortality can be eliminated or reduced with adaptation (more air conditioning, sports gels, better medicine, or people moving out of the South) then the economic picture really changes and the costs of climate will be reduced dramatically,\u201d he said. For that reason, Majkut said, \u201cthe research has a long way to go before it approaches anything like a comprehensive estimate of climate risk. Meanwhile, we emit.\u201d \u201cSEAGLAS provides a terrific framework to build upon,\u201d said Wagner in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known that there are enormous regional disparities across the globe. The fact that damages vary so much within a rich country like the U.S. is striking.\u201d So if climate modeling remains imperfect, what\u2019s the point of doing it? Researchers have spent the last 25 years trying to forecast the economic damages of climate change. Eventually, they hope to arrive at the social cost of carbon\u2014the damage to the economy dealt by every additional ton of carbon dioxide\u2014which would inform the creation of a carbon tax. Yet across all those years, political opposition to a carbon tax has only hardened, and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has only gone up. Hsiang said that precision is still important. \u201cIf we have a rough number, is that good enough?\u201d he asked. \u201cI definitely think we\u2019re never going to know the cost of climate change to seven decimal places. But it\u2019s unclear what a rough number means, because there\u2019s been very little benchmarking to any real-world data.\u201d (An additional paper in this edition of Science  clarifies that, so far, SEAGLAS has produced social costs of carbon that are fairly similar to two of the three most-famous economic climate models.) \u201cTo be honest, transforming the global energy system is not a cheap task. It\u2019s not a small thing,\u201d Hsiang said. \u201cAnd in some places, a lot of the concerns about implementing policy are related to concerns about the reliability of the numbers being used. It\u2019s a little like the doctor coming in and saying you\u2019re sick and he has some medicine which might work. You\u2019ll feel much more comfortable about the medicine if you know there\u2019s been clinical research and systematic control trials demonstrating it works.\u201d","headline":"The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change\u2019s Costs","article_name":532200.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/06\/global-warming-american-south\/532200\/","date_published":"2017-06-29 18:44:00","article_length":10946,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:53.858980","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/06\/global-warming-american-south\/532200\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Relocating to a landlocked city isn\u2019t enough. Put simply: Climate change poses the threat of global catastrophe. The planet isn\u2019t just getting hotter, it\u2019s destabilizing. Entire ecosystems are at risk. The future of humanity is at stake. Scientists warn that extreme weather will get worse and huge swaths of coastal cities will be submerged by ever-more-acidic oceans. All of which raises a question: If climate change continues at this pace, is anywhere going to be safe? \u201cSwitzerland would be a good guess,\u201d said James Hansen, the director of climate science at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute. Hansen\u2019s latest climate study warns that climate change is actually happening faster than computer models previously predicted. He and more than a dozen co-authors found that sea levels could rise at least 10 feet in the next 50 years. Slate  points out that although the study isn\u2019t yet peer-reviewed, Hansen is \u201cknown for being alarmist and also right.\u201d Okay, so. Switzerland might be a desirable place to live\u2014certainly in general, but also as a way to avoid the effects of climate change\u2014for a few reasons: It\u2019s landlocked, which means it\u2019s buffered from rising sea levels. And officials in Switzerland appear to be taking climate-related threats seriously\u2014which is not the case in much of the rest of the world. The country was the first to submit a contribution to the international climate agreement , promising to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. (In the United States, for comparison, President Barack Obama\u2019s new energy plan would require a 32-percent cut in carbon emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.) But that doesn\u2019t mean Switzerland is impervious to the effects of climate change. Warmer temperatures mean more melting snow\u2014Switzerland has lots of it\u2014which means higher risks of flooding and rockslides. Similarly, in Denver, Colorado, a landlocked city that might seem appealing because of its mile-high protection from rising seawaters, scientists warn that climate change could exacerbate droughts and harm water quality. \u201cWater quality is sensitive both to increased water temperatures and changes in patterns of precipitation,\u201d according to a Colorado Water Conservation Board report . \u201cFor example, changes in the timing and hydrograph may affect sediment load and pollution, impacting human health.\u201d Scientists believe heat waves and wildfires in the state will also become more severe and more frequent, according to a Climate Change Vulnerability Study published earlier this year. Staying away from scorching heat, hurricanes, floods, and wildfire will be difficult in a country that feels dramatically different in coming decades. \u201cThe best place really is Alaska,\u201d said Camilo Mora, a geologist at the University of Hawaii, in an interview with The New York Times last year. Mora is the author of a 2013 paper published in Nature that predicts startlingly high temperatures by today\u2019s standards\u2014the hottest on record for any given place\u2014will be normal by 2047. Monthly temperature averages will be hotter than anything on the books, according to Mora\u2019s research. \u201cAlaska is going to be the next Florida by the end of the century,\u201d he said. When considering climate-related vulnerabilities, economic stability may be as important as environmental factors. \u201cSo, it may be too glib an answer, but the safest place to be for climate change just may be a place where a strong, diversified economy and responsive institutions give the ability and the will to deal with challenges as they arise,\u201d said Richard Alley, a climate science professor at Pennsylvania State University. For example, California has remained fairly resilient despite experiencing brutal drought and devastating wildfires. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s economy continues to roll ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scholarship is very strong that the optimal path for dealing with climate change involves both slowing human causes of climate change and adapting to the changes that will occur on the way, while avoiding both panic and stasis,\u201d Alley told me. The key to safety, then, isn\u2019t to escape\u2014relocation to another world isn\u2019t exactly an option\u2014but to deal with and prepare for the reality of what\u2019s happening. \u00a0It isn\u2019t pretty. In fact, it\u2019s arguably \u201capocalyptic,\u201d Hansen wrote in The New York Times in 2012, imploring political leadership for urgent action on climate change. \u201cGlobal warming isn\u2019t a prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is happening.\u201d","headline":"Where to Move to Escape the Worst Effects of Climate Change","article_name":400304.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/08\/is-anywhere-on-earth-safe-from-climate-change\/400304\/","date_published":"2015-08-03 14:31:29","article_length":4477,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:55.657519","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/08\/is-anywhere-on-earth-safe-from-climate-change\/400304\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Local meteorologists are better positioned than anyone else to talk their communities through the facts about climate change. T he weatherman\u2019s striped tie is still snug on his neck as he starts an evening bath for his three kids, one of whom bolts naked from the bathroom and does a lap around the kitchen before running back, feet slapping on the hardwood floor. \u201cOkay,\u201d Shel Winkley says, walking into the kitchen where his wife is loading the dishwasher. \u201cI love you,\u201d he tells her, and then he walks outside to his gray Prius, gets in, and drives to the TV station. Dinner\u2019s over. Back to work. It\u2019s warm outside in Bryan, Texas, warmer than usual on this Wednesday night in October, and on KBTX at 10 p.m. Winkley is going to talk about rising temperatures as a symptom of global climate change . The climate crisis, of course, is a divisive issue in America. A little less than a third of adults don\u2019t see a crisis at all; they see a melodrama. Winkley, 36, used to not worry about climate change much either. A decade ago, Winkley was a few years out of college and focused on doing his job without messing up on air. TV was intense\u2014the hours, the pace, the volume of work\u2014and he was, as he puts it, a \u201cbaby deer.\u201d In school he\u2019d certainly learned about the climate, because he had to understand trends in long-term weather in order to issue short-term forecasts . But when class discussions turned to climate change, his meteorology professors talked mostly about natural cycles instead of human causes. Winkley, now planted back at his desk in front of his three computer monitors, is clicking and clacking, compiling the weather. On the center monitor he\u2019s loaded rows of daily temperature data, which he\u2019s copying one day at a time into a calendar open on the left monitor. In the right corner of the calendar is a big blank space. It\u2019s 8:27 p.m., and in an hour and a half, when the calendar is projected on the studio\u2019s green screen, he\u2019ll stand in front of the blank space. He has the script in his head. (On the right monitor is Twitter; on Twitter are fans, who respond to his tweets with piles of hearts.) He looks at a coming day\u2019s temperature and the number of degrees it\u2019s forecasted to climb above average. \u201cPff!\u201d he exclaims. \u201c17.\u201d One or two days like that in October, sure, he says, but several days last week have all exceeded the average by 10 degrees or more, which is not normal. \u201cIt\u2019s worrisome.\u201d The room around him is as large as a high-school classroom, and every surface in it seems to gleam: the polished floor, dark as obsidian; the four big cameras on tripods standing in the center of the floor; the five on-air desks ringed in chrome and faux mahogany that read, in block letters, news, sports, pinpoint, weather . TV is a fancy medium, and we like that, don\u2019t we? We like it so much that on average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we Americans watched TV for more than three hours every day in 2020. While newspapers are folding everywhere (more than 2,100 kaput since 2004), local TV has continued to command our attention like a tennis ball commands a dog. In 2020, local-news stations made a total of $18.4 billion in over-the-air ad revenue. That\u2019s enough money to build, say, our nation\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, and then buy a couple of baseball teams to play on its deck, which would make, in fact, for good TV. When Winkley finishes his prep for the 10 p.m. broadcast, it\u2019s only 9:23. \u201cNow the question is,\u201d he says to himself, \u201cdo I try to bang out a story, or do I play with Instagram?\u201d Both. He starts uploading a behind-the-scenes video montage of him and his team on set doing the news and the weather, and then, begrudgingly, begins writing a story for the station\u2019s website. He writes a headline, deletes it, ponders another headline, and then switches back to the video, which, finally, has uploaded. He watches it again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d Then, out of distractions, he resumes writing. \u201cOctober 2021,\u201d he clacks into the keyboard, \u201cis making a run at one of the warmest ever on record in Bryan\u2013College Station. As of Wednesday\u201d\u2014click-click, clack-clack. And now for a commercial break from our sponsors. S o let\u2019s do the math. The number, approximately, is 77 million, almost a third of American adults. That\u2019s how many people don\u2019t worry much or at all about global warming in this country, according to a September 2021 survey. Seventy-seven million adults could populate New York City nearly nine times over, but that\u2019d be a bad idea, considering big chunks of the Big Apple are projected to be permanently flooded by 2100. By then, if we keep cranking out carbon emissions, fires in the mountains of California may have doubled or tripled in size, and heat waves in the Midwest may be killing thousands of people each year. Seventy-seven million hardly worried or not worried at all, even though disaster is already an endless season. Why won\u2019t these Americans change their minds? One category of American adults (the 8 percent who are \u201cdismissive\u201d of global warming, according to polling by the Climate Change in the American Mind project) may not because the crisis contradicts their constructed reality. These Americans are mostly older, white, Republican men who see themselves as sturdy individuals rather than members of a society; instead of accepting that the planet is warming, these Americans reject facts in favor of conspiracy theories. Many of these Americans are drawn to conservative media, and their consumption of it invigorates their denial, which stimulates their consumption of conservative media, which invigorates their denial. These Americans, among others, are stuck in what researchers have called \u201creinforcing spirals.\u201d Social scientists have long assumed that most of the Americans misinformed about climate change were protecting a constructed reality, but that view is shifting. A more recent study suggests that many in this cohort, which could include the \u201cdismissive,\u201d are sincerely interested in the truth. These people aren\u2019t suspicious of the evidence because it contradicts their view of the crisis but because they don\u2019t trust the available messengers, namely the scientific community and the mainstream media. An alternative is partisan media, such as Fox News, but Fox has captured only a fraction of the American public; many more people watch less-partisan TV such as NBC, ABC, and CBS. \u201cMedia outlets with a significant partisan or ideological slant,\u201d the study states, \u201csimply do not reach most of the U.S. population.\u201d So these Americans seeking the truth have fallen through the climate cracks. Until about a decade ago, so had local TV meteorologists like Winkley. At that time, about half of the country\u2019s TV weathercasters either weren\u2019t certain that the world was warming or were certain that it wasn\u2019t. Those who said they\u2019d experienced obstacles to reporting on climate change in part cited problems similar to the public\u2019s today: They doubted the information they were reading, watching, and hearing. They had no trusted messenger, and many were too harried to find one. In 2010, a group of respected scientists and journalists, some of whom had worked in TV themselves, began trying to earn the trust of TV meteorologists. The group\u2019s nonprofit, Climate Central, along with partner organizations secured a National Science Foundation grant for their program, which started with a single TV meteorologist, Jim Gandy, in South Carolina. (Emerson Collective, which owns The Atlantic , provides funding to Climate Central.) Gandy had been interested in climate change but had never had time to do the research necessary for on-air segments. Every month, Climate Central provided him with localized climate-change content that he could use during broadcasts\u2014graphics, analyses, maps\u2014which was a huge help, he told me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout Climate Central.\u201d As the nonprofit expanded its efforts to more stations and more meteorologists, its members were careful not to preach policy solutions; instead, they asked broadcasters how they could help them report on climate change. \u201cWe never looked at it like, \u2018We\u2019re the ones in charge,\u2019\u201d Bernadette Woods Placky, the program\u2019s director, told me. \u201cIt was a relationship. It was a partnership.\u201d By 2012, Climate Central was working with 10 weathercasters. By the end of 2013, it was working with 100, and it had quadrupled its production of localized reports. The number of participating weathercasters continued to grow, and with more exposure to trusted climate-change information, they began to see climate change for what it was. By 2017, 95 percent of TV weathercasters agreed that the climate was indeed changing. By 2020, 80 percent acknowledged that human activity was a major reason. The facts here did what facts sometimes do when people are actually searching for the truth: They changed minds. Now weathercasters, with their eyes open to the crisis, are better positioned than anyone else to guide the remaining Americans through the same transition. One 2013 study , frequently cited, found that the more people liked a TV weathercaster, the more likely they were to be positively influenced by that weathercaster\u2019s discussion of climate change. Most Americans typically don\u2019t follow the news until something big happens; once the news cycle is done, surveys show, so are they. Only half of us hear about climate change on the news at least once a month, and only one out of five Americans say they hear about it from people they know in the same time frame. \u201cAs a result, it just isn\u2019t a salient or terribly intense concern for many,\u201d John Kotcher, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, told me. But when Americans do want the news, their local TV station is often their chosen source. There, people they recognize and like tell them about the weather, and, lately, these familiar people have begun mentioning \u201cclimate-change this\u201d and \u201cclimate-change that,\u201d making a crisis that seemed distant and abstract feel a little more real. \u201cI think there\u2019s a degree of kinship that comes with that\u201d connection, Kotcher said. \u201cAs a result, there\u2019s trust there that isn\u2019t necessarily present with, for example, members of the local university.\u201d Those climate scientists, he said, certainly know more about climate change than the local TV meteorologist; they\u2019re just not visible to the public. Winkley is. People see him on TV. People see him at the county fair. People see him walking on their sidewalks, eating dinner at their diners, buying groceries at their grocery store. \u201cShel is deeply plugged into this community,\u201d Josh Gorbutt, KBTX\u2019s news director, told me when I visited in October. \u201cHe is omnipresent. He turns the lights on in downtown Bryan with Santa Claus every year.\u201d When KBTX canceled its 2020 holiday lighting with Santa because of the pandemic, the station distributed little cardboard cutouts of Winkley beaming under a Santa hat. Viewers sent back pictures of little Winkley in their homes: perched on the mantle, hanging from a Christmas tree, fixed to a menorah. \u201cShel,\u201d they called it, \u201con the shelf.\u201d But Winkley, despite his dad charm and hokey on-air jokes and earnest, obvious joy in breaking down big scientific concepts into little understandable chunks, has a tough audience. Even if he succeeds in localizing the global crisis, in establishing that this rain or that heat wave or these winds are not normal, his audience\u2019s definition of normal can quickly change. Texas is a land of extremes, after all, and weather that initially looks like evidence of climate change can soon become routine: The climate\u2019s not changing. We\u2019ve always had storms like this. And people can only worry so much. Social scientists have a name for this too: \u201cthe finite pool of worry.\u201d In that pool are a lot of smaller crises, such as getting the kids to school, getting them COVID-tested so they can even go to school, getting yourself to work, getting the kids home, getting the kids to eat dinner. Getting them, like Winkley was struggling with on that unseasonably warm October night, to take a bath. A nd we\u2019re back! Thanks for staying tuned. While y\u2019all were gone Winkley managed to bang out his story for the TV station\u2019s website, and now Rusty Surette and Karla Castillo have entered the studio through a hidden door and taken their seats behind the anchor desk labeled news . A camera snaps to each of them. Castillo fixes her hair and Surette looks down at a laptop. Winkley pulls on a blue blazer that matches his blue slacks, walks behind the pinpoint weather desk, looks at his watch, dons a serious face, and looks up. They\u2019re live. \u201cControversial comments,\u201d Surette says to the camera, \u201cmade by a city councilman. What he said and how the councilman\u2019s responding, tonight.\u201d Castillo: \u201cA Bryan man gets life in prison. Prosecutors say he will never hurt another child.\u201d Surette: \u201cA drive-through dispute leads to a customer being arrested. Police say she struck a pair of fast-food workers with her car.\u201d Castillo: \u201cThe skyline of College Station will change again. We\u2019ll show you where the newest high-rise is planned.\u201d Surette: \u201cThe Houston Astros are one win away from going back to the World Series after beating the Red Sox in Boston.\u201d Winkley: \u201cA few of us may drop into a cloud of fog first thing tomorrow morning. Humidity is on the increase across the Brazos Valley, along with temperatures, in the coming days.\u201d Now a segment on that council member\u2019s controversial comment\u2014\u201cRacist,\u201d an opponent says; \u201cResign,\u201d says another\u2014as Winkley strolls to the green screen where he\u2019s about to do his forecast. In a sense, Winkley\u2019s always been a weatherman. He grew up in Lubbock, Texas, so terrified of storms that he\u2019d watch forecasters plot their course county by county on the TV, atlas in his lap. If a storm got close, his family\u2019s power would cut out, and in the dark, he\u2019d have no idea where the tornado was. One morning after a storm, when he was in high school, he walked outside and looked down the road. A few homes had rolled over in the wind. He doesn\u2019t know why, but after that he wasn\u2019t afraid of storms anymore. He was fascinated by them. He began telling people he wanted to be a weatherman. Winkley has been at KBTX, a CBS affiliate, for 13 years now, and the job still feels important. One time, after he\u2019d finished talking to students at a local school, a mom walked up and thanked him for staying up late so many nights to track storms for them. That touched Winkley. \u201cI like to know that people care,\u201d he told me, because he cares about them. When he talks about climate change on air, he\u2019s simply trying to help Texans prepare for its impacts. Often he won\u2019t even say the words climate change, because he knows that for many of his viewers, they\u2019re trigger words. If they tune him out, he can\u2019t do his job. Winkley never rejected the reality of climate change, but when he graduated from college in 2007, he didn\u2019t think much about it. Though he\u2019d read articles and studies online, some seemed to contradict one another; most discussed distant phenomena. As the impacts of climate change became clearer, his interest grew. Winkley started at KBTX in 2009, and after a few years he saw that local weather patterns were evolving in ways predicted by climate-change computer models. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, making landfall on the Gulf Coast. The ocean, which rose by up to 12 feet, crashed down streets. Winds, which exceeded 100 miles an hour, toppled houses. Rainfall, which ultimately tallied 50 inches in some areas, scattered the debris throughout communities that had never seen such a disaster. Man, Winkley thought as he reported on the hurricane, we just picked up a year\u2019s worth of rain in three days. What was once an academic curiosity, in his mind, had become an immediate crisis. Surette and Castillo have finished the news, and the camera on Winkley goes live. \u201cI hope,\u201c he told me earlier in the night while he was compiling temperature data, \u201cthat people know I\u2019m not trying to push an agenda.\u201d Because he isn\u2019t. He is worried. Not the theatrical kind of worry that conservative talk-show hosts mock on prime-time TV. The genuine kind. The kind of worry he felt when he was a kid while outside his house, in the dark, a tornado was flipping homes. Storms may fascinate him now, but climate change, he says, is frightening. \u201cThis is the point,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it for a long time\u2014like, we\u2019ve got to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u201d But natural disasters are now unnaturally common, \u201cso the question is: Is this what you want to live with, or do you want to live with something worse?\u201d On air, Winkley begins to speak. \u201cThe mornings we\u2019ve had recently where temperatures were nice and cool outside were definitely great to have, especially in the month of October. What you\u2019re looking at here, though\u2014these are our morning temperatures compared to average, so far in the month.\u201d In the studio, the green screen is still just a green screen, but on the thousands of TVs across 16 counties, people see their friendly weathercaster talking to them from the right-hand corner of the calendar he\u2019d built earlier that night. Nearly every day of the month is colored red: unseasonably high temperatures. \u201cAnd you can see most of our mornings have been above average. In fact, for the 12th, 13th, and 14th\u201d\u2014he points at those days then looks into the camera, eyebrows raised\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees above average. And I bring that up because we\u2019re falling right back into that trend.\u201d Beyond the frame, the teleprompter is projecting a script Winkley ad-libbed earlier, but he\u2019s not closely following the text. He normally doesn\u2019t. He tends to improvise the way he is tonight, drawing from some other place, speaking rapidly, blowing through commas and periods and stringing every sentence together with semicolons. He is energized. Management\u2019s never gotten in his way when he wants to talk about climate change. They support him. Now a red line appears behind him on all the TVs. The line slopes steadily upward. \u201cAnd this is a trend, as the climate continues to change, that we continue to see. Our colleagues over at Climate Central have run the numbers of the past 50 years, and since the 1970s, about 18 more days are now considered warmer than average in September, October, and November, which equates to an average of about three and a half degrees warmer now than we were back in the 1970s. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue with that warming trend this week,\u201d he says, transitioning flawlessly to the weather forecast\u2014which is what his viewers tuned in for in the first place. O n my last day in Texas, I take the rental car on a drive Hertz would not have liked: down an old asphalt road, then down a sandy road, then through a deep ditch that grabs my bumper, then up a grassy driveway to the top of a steep hill ringed in green trees. The hillside, about 50 miles outside Bryan, is verdant, and on its east-facing flank are three acres of blackberry bushes and peach and plum trees. They\u2019re the pride and livelihood of Steve and Carole Huebner, 72 and 71, who are seated at a table inside, eating blackberry coffee cake and drinking coffee from Styrofoam cups. Everyone has an opinion on climate change, Steve says. Okay. Up until a few years ago, the way he looked at it was that the climate was cyclical. \u201cThat to me was some of my reasons for the changes. Now\u201d\u2014he sighs. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why we rely on Shel.\u201d \u201cSomething\u2019s definitely happening,\u201d Carole says. \u201cMore and more evidence is coming out that says it\u2019s man-made,\u201d Steve says. But there are some groups that say cows are causing it, \u201cand, well, that\u2019s a bunch of crap. Literally.\u201d He raises his eyebrows, punctuating the joke. Steve\u2019s humor is dry. Years with only a little cold weather are typically unusual, Carole says, but those years are always a big problem because the blackberries and plums and peaches need the cold to fruit. \u201cBut our winters,\u201d Steve says, taking a bite of coffee cake, \u201chave gotten milder. Okay. Some people are going to call that climate change. We may say, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s another cyclical pattern.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still kinda not sure,\u201d Carole says. \u201cWell, the term has been used as a political football,\u201d Steve says, \u201cand that turns us off.\u201d The politics turn off many Texans. The day before I\u2019d gone to the Brazos Valley fair, where Winkley and a camera operator had done two live segments on the weather. I was walking around with an employee of the TV station who introduced me to two of her friends, both 4-H moms, who were standing together under their pop-up tent. They beamed at me. But then I said, \u201cHi. My name is Dan Schwartz and I\u2019m with The Atlantic , and I want to talk with you about climate change,\u201d and their smiles fell off their faces like a pair of refrigerator magnets. \u201cOh,\u201d the TV-station employee said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what the story was about.\u201d We are all constrained by psychology, and, boy, is it complicated. But external forces also shape our perceptions of the world. Climate change is a political football only because public figures and corporate agents continue to wrap it in cowhide and call it a hoax. Historically, science and journalism have kept the facts straight, but large pockets of the American public don\u2019t trust those institutions anymore, which leaves them open to less-honest messengers. Fox News, for example, is a longtime broadcaster of climate misinformation (as are the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal , which, like Fox News, is part of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire). In October, Fox Corporation launched Fox Weather , a 24-hour weather platform \u201cexpected to change the way Americans consume weather news and analysis,\u201d Fox News announced. After its debut, critics pointed out that Fox Weather seemed to be largely ignoring the role of climate change in its extreme-weather coverage. Who is honest? What is real? As our emissions continue to warm the world, which messengers will the remaining Americans who are looking for the truth come to trust? \u201cWe read. We see things,\u201d Steve says. We see that the Arctic sea ice is melting, he adds. TV weathercasters like Winkley? \u201cIt just worries me that the powers that be will go too far in the other direction\u201d as far as banning fossil fuels, Carole says. Or partisan outlets like Fox News? \u201cThis is Texas, after all.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes are teasing, but then he\u2019s serious. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough trusted information to say, \u2018Yes, this is what I believe or not.\u2019\u201d We are seeing a warming trend in October, though, Carole says. (The Huebners have kept a weather station on their hill for about two decades.) \u201cAnd that concerns me.\u201d Then again, she adds, the temperatures this summer never even broke 100. \u201cSo there you go,\u201d Steve says. \u201cWe almost right now are neutral as to what we\u2019re seeing and what it\u2019s caused by.\u201d He finishes his coffee. \u201cCycles,\u201d he says, \u201cand in some ways I\u2019m still leaning that way. So I guess the verdict is still out.\u201d This Atlantic Planet story was supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education. Enjoy unlimited access to The Atlantic.

{"id":null,"body":"As the world reckons with the grim reality of the climate crisis, right-wing populists are adapting their message. Perhaps the 234 scientists behind this week\u2019s landmark climate assessment had hoped that their report\u2014published during a summer of deadly flooding , wildfires , and heat waves \u2014would act as a wake-up call, one that would unite the world\u2019s governments and parties. But political consensus on the issue of climate change, much like the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, is unlikely to be achieved: Although most mainstream political parties have at the very least acknowledged the reality of human-induced climate change and the need to implement sweeping new policies to address it, several populist parties continue to reject the scientific consensus. Even those that accept it tend to oppose mainstream solutions, including multilateral efforts to address the problem. Europe, which has experienced some of the summer\u2019s worst climate disasters, offers a preview of the populist right\u2019s next political battleground . What has emerged so far is not a change of heart but, rather, a shift in tone. Populist parties have traded outright denialism for the position that climate policy, like that of immigration and the coronavirus pandemic, represents yet another top-down elite agenda that stands to hit ordinary people, particularly those in the working class, the hardest. If this line of argument sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is. In recent years, right-wing populists have positioned themselves as Europe\u2019s staunchest defenders\u2014against immigration and threats to national sovereignty; against pandemic restrictions and the influence of global institutions; and against what they regard as national governments\u2019 hysteria over climate change, which populists have described as \u201c degenerate fearmongering \u201d at best and \u201c totalitarian \u201d at worst. This isn\u2019t to say that Europe\u2019s populist right is united in its opposition to climate change. According to a 2019 study by Adelphi, an environmental-policy think tank based in Berlin, only two of Europe\u2019s nearly two dozen right-wing populist parties\u2014Hungary\u2019s far-right Fidesz and Latvia\u2019s National Alliance\u2014explicitly support the scientific consensus on the climate crisis. But among the others, differences exist. Some, including the far-right Alternative for Germany and the Dutch Party for Freedom, reject the idea of anthropogenic global warming, whereas others, such as France\u2019s National Rally and Spain\u2019s Vox, have begun to advocate their own brand of nationalist environmentalism\u2014one that supports local policies to tackle climate change but simultaneously rejects international agreements aimed at doing the same. In practice, this means promoting conservation at the local level (through policies such as favoring local consumption and preserving limited resources) while repudiating international-led initiatives such as the Paris Agreement. In the case of Vox, it has meant advocating to preserve Spain\u2019s \u201c natural heritage \u201d on the one hand and opposing efforts to rein in the country\u2019s carbon emissions on the other. Read: It\u2019s grim The populist right\u2019s about-face on climate is partly driven by politics. As voters become more attuned to the threats posed by the climate crisis, the repercussions of which are already being felt in countries such as Germany, Italy, Greece, and Spain, some of Europe\u2019s populist parties have been forced to change tack. Vox, which once dismissed climate change as a hoax , has since promoted its own version of environmentalism as an alternative to what it describes as the \u201c green religion \u201d of the left. France\u2019s National Rally has experienced a similar transition in recent years, from the climate skepticism of its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, to the identity-based environmentalism of his daughter, and the party\u2019s current leader, Marine Le Pen. Populist parties realize that \u201cthere are diminishing returns in playing the denialist card,\u201d Catherine Fieschi, a political analyst who tracks dissent against climate policy in Europe, told me. Unlike issues such as immigration or the European Union, climate change simply isn\u2019t as divisive in Europe (something that can\u2019t be said for other parts of the world, including the United States ). Until recently, it wasn\u2019t considered a top priority for voters. Even parties that haven\u2019t explicitly changed course on climate change have found ways to incorporate the issue into their worldview. Climate change, after all, fits neatly within the populist narrative of the \u201cpure people\u201d versus the \u201ccorrupt elite.\u201d In the populist right\u2019s telling, green policies such as fuel taxes and decarbonization incentives represent an elitist attack on the lives of ordinary people. \u201cPopulists have been very good at saying, \u2018We\u2019re not just going to protect you from climate change,\u2019\u201d Fieschi said. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to protect you from an elite that doesn\u2019t give a damn about the cost that climate policy is going to take on you.\u2019\u201d Beyond the economic argument is another classic from the populist arsenal\u2014the anti-expertise argument. According to Ralph Schroeder, a co-author of a recent study from the Oxford Internet Institute on the link between climate skepticism and support for right-wing populists, populist rejection of climate science \u201cis not so much correlated with economic hardship that it may impose,\u201d but rather with the belief that \u201cexperts shouldn\u2019t tell us what to do.\u201d Helen Lewis: I\u2019ve hit my climate tipping point But perhaps the most cogent argument populists are beginning to make about climate change is one that they\u2019ve been pushing for much of the last year: that this is another example of the establishment trying to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more easy to do in the wake of the pandemic,\u201d Fieschi told me, noting the restrictive measures imposed by European governments to curb the spread of the coronavirus, many of which have been met with protests . \u201cWhat [populists] are saying is \u2018This is the thin end of the wedge, this pandemic thing. Now they\u2019re going to really curtail your freedoms.\u2019\u201d The biggest challenge facing this populist argument, however, is time\u2014something that, as the United Nations climate report made clear, the world is in short supply of. Extreme weather events are becoming more common; urgency to tackle global warming will grow. While populist arguments against \u201cclimate hysteria\u201d may provide temporary reassurance, they are no substitute for real policy solutions. For people displaced by worsening fires and floods, blaming elites will offer little comfort.","headline":"The Far-Right View on Climate Politics","article_name":619709.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2021\/08\/far-right-view-climate-ipcc\/619709\/","date_published":"2021-08-10 16:04:08","article_length":6599,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:57.555345","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2021\/08\/far-right-view-climate-ipcc\/619709\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\"A lot of young conservatives are frustrated by the false choice between no climate action and a big government regulatory scheme.\" Consider the life of a current college sophomore, a 20-year-old. She was born in 1998, at the time the warmest year ever measured, when a monster El Ni\u00f1o pattern spawned floods and droughts around the world. Seven years later, as she started first grade, Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans, and 2005 set a new record as the warmest year ever measured. That record fell again as she started fifth grade and sixth grade, and in her sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. In fact, 18 of the 20 years she has been alive have ranked among the warmest ever recorded. But through those two decades, the United States has not moved much closer to doing anything about the underlying problem: human-caused climate change. Maybe 20-year-olds can help. On Wednesday, a coalition of 34 student groups from around the country\u2014including 23 chapters of the College Republicans\u2014announced the formation of Students for Carbon Dividends, a bipartisan group calling for national legislation to fight climate change. Specifically, they\u2019ve endorsed the Baker-Shultz plan, a proposal to impose an expensive new tax on carbon pollution while slashing Environmental Protection Agency regulations. That plan gets its name from the two GOP graybeards\u2014James Baker III and George Shultz, both former secretaries of state\u2014who first advanced it last February . It marks the first time that a coalition of College Republican groups has publicly backed a climate-change policy. \u201cAdult leaders have not acted efficiently or effectively on this issue, and we are stepping forward to fill the void,\u201d said Alexander Posner, the founding president of Students for Carbon Dividends and a 22-year-old American history major at Yale University. \u201cI think a lot of young conservatives are frustrated by the false choice between no climate action and a big government regulatory scheme. They feel pressured that those are the only two options, and they\u2019re hungry for a conservative pathway forward on climate,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s unique here is that the elder statesmen of the Republican Party are kind of uniting with the younger generation, to press the middle generation to act on climate.\u201d The Baker-Shultz plan has four major components. First, it creates a new $40 tax on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, which comes to about an extra 36 cents per gallon of gasoline . It also creates a new \u201cborder carbon\u201d tax, raising the prices of imported goods from countries that do not impose a carbon tax themselves. Instead of pocketing the money from those two policies, the plan calls for the government to redistribute it as a monthly check to every American. A family of four would find itself with an extra $2,000 every year, they estimate. (Baker and Shultz claim that their plan should be called a carbon dividend, not a carbon tax, because of these rebates.) Resources for the Future, an independent economics think tank, estimates that a $40 revenue-neutral carbon tax would prevent 16.8 billion metric tons of carbon pollution. The Climate Leadership Council , which backs the Baker-Shultz plan, believes that the policy would more than fulfill the U.S. commitment under the Paris Agreement. In return for these concessions to environmentalism, the Baker-Shultz promises a \u201csignificant regulatory rollback.\u201d The proposal calls for a full repeal of the Clean Power Plan and a general restriction on the EPA\u2019s ability to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions. When the plan was first introduced, it generated some press coverage, but the attention quickly  fizzled . The proposal seemed too na\u00efve to work. Republicans had just won an election campaigning against President Obama\u2019s energy policies: Why would they embrace climate change now? And through its control of the White House, the GOP could repeal the Clean Power Plan all by itself. But the centrism that annoyed Washington insiders turned out to be perfect for college politicos. Posner was inspired by the plan when he first read about it in the press. He contacted the Climate Leadership Council and ultimately interned there over the summer. When he returned to campus this fall, he was determined to recruit more college conservatives to their cause. He and his co-organizers have succeeded\u2014at least in name. College Republican groups at Auburn University, the University of Miami, the University of Michigan, and more than a dozen other schools announced their support for the plan on Wednesday. So did the Republican club at a certain school near Boston. \u201cThe Republican Party has failed to have a coherent strategy for climate change,\u201d said Kiera O\u2019Brien, a 19-year-old government major and the president of the Harvard Republican Club. She is also a vice president of the Students for Carbon Dividends. \u201cI was born and raised in Ketchikan, Alaska, so I grew up with a deep respect for the environment,\u201d she told me. \u201cMoving to the Lower 48 after growing up in Alaska was shocking\u2014even just from the perspective of light pollution, of going outside and not being able to see the stars.\u201d \u201cI may not see the effects [of global warming] yet in my hometown, but the world\u2019s changing,\u201d she added. Students for Carbon Dividends has also succeeded in recruiting six College Democratic groups and several environmental-advocacy organizations to the cause. \u201cThis solution is not necessarily perfect, but it\u2019s a good one that we can work with Republicans on, and it\u2019s an improvement on the status quo,\u201d said Jordan Cozby, the president of the Yale College Democrats and a 20-year-old history major from Huntsville, Alabama. \u201cRecognizing that the balance of power is the way it is, it\u2019s unlikely that Democrats or any pro-climate members of Congress will be able to push through a partisan, Democratic climate plan. So what are the solutions we can look for with the current circumstances?\u201d he asked Wednesday. He added that many Democrats want to make sure the proposal is \u201cas robust and environmentally conscious\u201d as possible \u201cbefore any of the regulations are pulled back.\u201d Not every young conservative who joined seemed sold on climate science. Dylan Jones, the chairman of the University of Kansas College Republicans, told me that much of what he knows about global warming he learned from his dad, who works as a meteorologist in Wichita. \u201cWhat I like to think is, something\u2019s obviously happening with the climate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been skeptical of many of the questions surrounding it. I think a lot of the conversation around climate change is still an ever-changing debate\u2014it\u2019s not necessarily set in stone, or scientific fact, that humans may be a cause.\u201d This view is not supported by established science. In November, a comprehensive report from 13 U.S. federal and military agencies declared that human activity was \u201cthe dominant cause\u201d of observed global warming since the mid-20th century. \u201cThere is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence,\u201d it said. Yet despite Jones\u2019s doubtfulness about climate science as a whole, he says imposing a price on carbon pollution was the right thing to do. \u201cI believe the free market works best, except in certain scenarios when it exhibits externalities that [pricing] doesn\u2019t take into account. Then it\u2019s necessary for the government to step in and correct that market, so there is an efficient allocation of resources to consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not know whether the carbon emissions are causing global warming or climate change, but we do know that there are negative impacts on the environment of carbon emissions. This would be a great solution to take in those externalities and create more of a free market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can still choose to consume or emit as much [carbon dioxide] as you want\u2014it\u2019s a free market\u2014but you\u2019re just going to be taxed on that.\u201d Jones also liked that the plan would send revenue back to Americans. \u201cIn a world where we\u2019re seeing stagnant wage growth, this is a good way to bring that money back to the people. It\u2019s a very populist idea,\u201d he told me. It\u2019s not clear how Students for Carbon Dividends will try to bring the Baker-Shultz plan to Congress. But the group is significant if it represents a generational willingness to compromise on the issue, especially among conservatives at elite universities. After all, the opinions of young Republicans presaged the party\u2019s most important recent shift leftward. In 2014, a majority of young Republicans said they supported same-sex marriage . The party as a whole is now evenly split on that issue , and President Trump has shown little interest in fighting against the Supreme Court ruling that legalized it. But it\u2019s also unclear when\u2014and if\u2014young Republicans will have enough clout to shape the party\u2019s legislative agenda. Think-tank centrists like to cite a few promising-sounding statistics about new voters: Seventy-four percent of young conservatives say that the United States should address climate change, according to a 2016 poll from the interest group Young Conservatives for Energy Reform . But other polls show shallower concern for climate change among Millennial Republicans. And Republicans may not need young votes to win. Roughly a quarter of all young Republicans left the party between December 2015 and March 2017, according to the Pew Research Center . (Democrats did not experience a generational exodus during the same period.) Yet this hemorrhage has not yet seemed to hurt them. Republicans won Congress and the White House in 2016 despite losing among Millennials , Gen Xers , and college-educated whites . Experts say that climate advocates should see the polling data\u2014and the existence of Students for Carbon Dividends\u2014as positive developments. \u201cI\u2019d say that such announcements can\u2019t hurt and might do some good,\u201d says Dan Kahan, a professor of law and psychology at Yale University who studies partisan polarization and climate change. \u201cIn general, Millennials seem less divided than other age cohorts\u201d on climate change. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to see College Republicans leading on this issue,\u201d said Edward Maibach, a professor of climate-change communication at George Mason University, in an email. \u201cThe Republican party has a clear climate-change problem,\u201d he told me. \u201cBeing on the wrong side of the scientific facts is bad for the party, bad for the country, and bad for the world. When College Republicans come out in large numbers in support of a revenue-neutral price on carbon, it will speak loudly to Republican members of Congress who are going to need the support of those voters at the next election, and the next, and so on.\u201d \u201cThankfully, young voters will be around for a long time,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s best to earn their support now.\u201d","headline":"They're Here to Fix Climate Change!

{"id":null,"body":"The country shows the power of self-determination when it comes to development and climate policy. F ifty years ago , Bangladesh won independence from Pakistan amid devastating climate disaster. The year before, in 1970, the Bhola cyclone had killed up to half a million people. The human toll of the disaster\u2014 one of the deadliest cyclones in recorded history\u2014was amplified by a woefully insufficient response by Pakistan\u2019s government. Faced with renewed demands for independence in what was then East Pakistan, the military waged a brutal crackdown and genocide. In the War of Independence, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, an estimated 200,000 women were raped , and 6 million homes were destroyed. From these beginnings, Bangladesh has remained, in the imagination of much of the developed world, a poster child for poverty and looming climate catastrophe\u2014a warning for what will befall the global poor if climate change is not addressed. The country\u2019s low elevation and high population density do make it distinctly vulnerable to rising sea levels and natural hazards such as cyclones. But the narrative of Bangladesh as a climate victim in waiting is almost entirely misinformed. From the fight for independence to now, as I recently wrote for Breakthrough Journal , Bangladesh in fact represents a success story , showing the power of self-determination when it comes to development and climate policy. An accurate telling of Bangladesh\u2019s recent development should start with natural gas. The country\u2019s rich domestic endowment of the resource was the driving force of its modernization. In 1974, the government nationalized Bangladesh\u2019s energy resources, but rather than selling its gas abroad, the country opted to keep much of it. And rather than use the gas for consumption in people\u2019s homes, the authorities channeled it into activities such as power generation for industrial growth, the development of the fertilizer sector, water supply for irrigation, and cement production. That, in turn, fueled spectacular expansion in agricultural production , and by 2019, Bangladesh was self-sufficient in food, and had also become a significant exporter of textiles, apparel, and leather products. Its economy is now the fastest growing in South Asia, but because natural gas constitutes more than 60 percent of its primary energy use, the country is greener than many of its neighbors, such as India, which depends more on coal. Alongside this economic progress, Bangladesh cut both extreme poverty and infant mortality by some 70 percent from 1990 to 2016. Life expectancy is only seven years shy of the United States\u2019. In 2015, Bangladesh\u2019s progress was recognized by the World Bank, which upgraded it to a \u201clower-middle income\u201d country. Bangladesh has also adapted to climate change with improved forecasting, public community-wide training and education campaigns, and infrastructure investments. As a result, death tolls from cyclones since Bhola have ticked down to the double or triple digits in recent years. These casualty numbers are still tragic, but a long way off from the shocking human cost of a half century ago. Certainly, these adaptive efforts have their limits, particularly as the effects of climate change worsen, but Bangladesh has bought itself time to make an energy transition while not compromising on the needs of its people. M uch of Bangladesh\u2019s growth model has flown in the face of recommendations from international-development institutions, well-meaning NGOs, and global environmental groups. The International Monetary Fund, for example, has long criticized subsidies such as the ones Bangladesh uses in the energy sector, downplaying the benefits that the combination of those and domestic use of gas has brought to Bangladesh\u2019s economy. Others have urged the diversification of countries\u2019 economies and energy sectors to reduce carbon emissions, typically touting investments in \u201cgreener\u201d energy sectors and the phasing out of fossil fuels, including natural gas. Still more argue that, for low-lying countries to survive global warming, large cuts to energy consumption are needed now. But generic recommendations haven\u2019t made much sense for Bangladesh in the past. And in the future, they may be even more off base. For one, although the nation has opportunities for hydroelectric power, harnessing it will not be possible without the large-scale displacement of communities. Potential for wind and solar energy is also limited: Most of Bangladesh\u2019s land is fertile and required for food production, whereas unused nonagricultural land is scarce. In addition, to lift millions more people out of poverty and raise living standards across the country, Bangladesh needs to produce and consume much more energy, which means that some imagined cut to energy consumption is off the table. In short, Bangladesh illustrates why priorities at the international level aren\u2019t always appropriate at the local one. For countries such as Bangladesh, the question should not be how to phase out fossil fuels the fastest, but how to make the best and cleanest use of them\u2014and the infrastructure around them. Doing so will mean continuing to prioritize productive domestic use of the country\u2019s remaining natural-gas reserves and finding ways to use that sector\u2019s infrastructure, resources, and knowledge to tap cleaner energy sources that make sense for local circumstances, such as geothermal and hydrogen. Geothermal energy has been used in many countries for heat and power generation, but it does not make up a very large share of total global energy generation, mainly because of the high cost of infrastructure required. However, using oil and gas exploration wells and depleted wells for geothermal heat and power generation is becoming possible, as a recent study from me and my colleagues showed. Hydrogen, meanwhile, first became an important part of the energy industry in the mid-20th century, but has recently received renewed focus as a potential replacement for oil and gas . As with geothermal, Bangladesh\u2019s existing infrastructure might be repurposed in a number of ways to support a hydrogen economy: Already, half of the world\u2019s hydrogen is produced with natural gas. To be sure, all of this would require huge levels of investment, but Bangladesh, with its well-developed gas sector, has opportunities to move to geothermal and hydrogen over time\u2014and in ways that are consistent with both its climate and development goals. But to get there, both imperatives need to be taken equally seriously, and the actors best placed to balance them are local. T he vision of Bangladesh as a place on the brink of being overwhelmed by rising seas is outdated, just as the notion that it might rapidly transition to renewable energy is unrealistic. In the 50 years since the Bhola cyclone, the nation has carved out a path to development thanks to natural gas. Turning away from that path precipitously would strand the nation\u2019s fossil-fuel assets and undermine its hard-won sovereignty and development gains. For countries such as Bangladesh, fossil fuels cannot be abandoned overnight, at least not within any global framework for mitigating climate change that could be characterized as sustainable or just. The transition to a low-carbon economy in less developed nations should go as fast as it can and no faster\u2014meaning that affordable, abundant energy services, and all the associated human development and economic benefits those bring, cannot be given up in pursuit of climate-change-mitigation objectives. There will be multiple transition models, all deeply entangled with development imperatives, local histories, governance, and resource endowments. Choices must be made democratically. They must respect sovereignty. And they must allow developing nations to build the technology, infrastructure, and institutions they need to chart their own path.","headline":"Bangladesh Really Is a Climate Success Story","article_name":620224.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/10\/bangladesh-climate-change\/620224\/","date_published":"2021-10-09 10:00:00","article_length":7910,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:55:59.090735","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/10\/bangladesh-climate-change\/620224\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"An interview with author and activist Naomi Klein For more than a decade, Naomi Klein has been calling attention to the invisible, abstract concerns that hide in the shadows of global trade: the exploitation of far-off workers, the environmental destruction, the corruption that contorts political systems. In her latest book, This Changes Everything , Klein tackles the unintended but inevitable consequence of fueling GDP with oil and gas and coal: a destabilized climate. These days, the prevailing mood in response to climate change seems to be one of despair. It's too late. The problem is too massive. But Klein sees something else. She sees a possibility: that a more humane economy can be shaped by aggressively combating climate change. I spoke with her about the opportunity to transform society at the precipice of calamity. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. Hamza Shaban: You write that climate deniers are wrong on the science, but compared to liberals, are more clear-eyed when it comes to the political and economic consequences of robust climate action. How so? Naomi Klein: I\u2019ve spent a fair bit of time hanging out with some of the hardcore climate deniers. And I think they\u2019re very open about the fact that what brought them to this issue is not that they discovered a problem with climate science. It\u2019s that they look at what the science is saying and they realize that if the science is true, it would upend their ideological project\u2014because their ideological project calls for deregulation, austerity cuts, privatization of the public sphere, deregulated free trade. And if you just glance at the kinds of policies we would need in order to take the science seriously, it would mean strong regulations of the corporate sector; it would mean big investments in the public sphere to prepare ourselves for heavy weather and to lower our emissions rapidly. It would also mean transfers of wealth, which they\u2019re not very big fans of. So they\u2019re faced with the problem that either the science is true and their ideology is in deep trouble, or the science must be a vast conspiracy and there ideology is fine. And they\u2019ve chosen the latter for obvious reasons. But I do believe they understand that if we were to take the science seriously it would require upending the neoliberal consensus. Shaban: In your last book, The Shock Doctrine , you argue that in the past four decades, corporate interests have used extreme shocks\u2014natural disasters, wars, financial meltdowns\u2014to ram through policies that blunt regulations, cut social spending, and push the privatization of public projects. Now you argue that climate change can be the \u201cpeople\u2019s shock.\u201d What do you mean by that? Klein: What I\u2019m arguing in this book is that we need to return to the progressive tradition of responding to deep crisis by trying to get at the root causes of the crisis. And the best example of that is the way in which the progressive movement responded to the Great Depression. It became an opportunity to change the way we organized our economies, to regulate banks, to launch social programs that got at the roots of inequality. If we really believed that climate change is an existential crisis, if we believed climate change is a weapon of mass destruction, as John Kerry said , why on Earth would you leave it to the vagaries of the market? Can you imagine if after 9\/11 if President Bush had just said: \u201cYou know, our liberty and way of life has been threatened so I\u2019m going to propose a market solution to terrorism.\u201d The truth is when our elites really believe that they face a crisis, as they did when the banks collapsed, they bend all kinds of free-market rules. That\u2019s why the climate march happening this weekend is significant. Because it\u2019s regular people literally sounding the climate alarm: We consider this to be a crisis even if our leaders are behaving as if it\u2019s not. And I think that our only hope is in mobilizing from below, to say we believe in science, we believe that this is a crisis, and therefore we want to act like it. Shaban: One of the developments in climate politics is the acceptance by liberal politicians and elites of an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d energy policy, the idea of clean coal, incrementalism, minor lifestyle changes, carbon trading, and reducing the issue to the narrow frame of energy security. Do you think this is doomed to fail? Is this another kind of climate denialism? Klein: Just to be clear, I think this is denying the politics of climate change, not denying the science. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doomed to fail; I think it\u2019s failed. A large part of the wonky climate-change world is still trying to prove that you can respond to climate change within the context of neoliberal orthodoxy. That it can be solved by putting just a few market mechanisms in place and then you can, as they say, \u201ctax and relax,\u201d and then we don\u2019t need to have a full-throated ideological debate about what kinds of values we want to govern our society. And that\u2019s where I think there is a form of liberal climate denial going on. They may not be denying the science, but they may be denying the implications of the science. Shaban: Over the summer, the journalist Ezra Klein wrote a story at Vox listing the reasons he\u2019s a climate pessimist, with the headline 7 Reasons America Will Fail on Climate Change . Klein: I read that piece and I found it incredibly revealing. Ezra Klein is a very smart liberal who believes in reformist change. And I think it\u2019s hard to define what the difference is between a radical and a liberal. To me, I\u2019ve always thought that the real difference is that liberals believe in change from the inside and are generally suspicious and slightly off-put by the messiness of social movements. And leftists and radicals believe that social movements are responsible for the greatest progressive victories that we have ever won. What was interesting to me about Ezra's piece, and also frankly a lot of what I\u2019m hearing from journalists as I launch the book, is I expected to be having debates about the science, about the policy. But basically what I\u2019m being told by liberal journalists after liberal journalist is: \u201cI agree with you about the science and the policy prescriptions.\u00a0Where I don\u2019t agree is the idea that social movements can change things.\u201d I think that climate change is really highlighting this essential difference between radicals and that sort of don\u2019t-get-too-excited-about-anything fetish-for-centrism that is so powerful in American politics, in particular among liberals. Now I thought there was something uniquely bizarre about putting that in the form of a list. I was imagining other listicles throughout history like: 7 Reasons Slavery Will Never Be Abolished. The Top 8 Reasons Women Will Never Get to Vote. Luckily there were crazy radicals who believed otherwise. And it wasn\u2019t because they figured out the averages and really crunched the numbers and made a chart. Shaban: Changing the Earth\u2019s climate in ways that will be incontrovertibly disastrous seems to be easier to accept than the prospect of altering the fundamental, growth-based, profit-seeking logic of capitalism. Why is that thinking so embedded in our society? Klein: It\u2019s easier to imagine ourselves drifting toward a climate meltdown than it is to imagine ourselves deliberately changing the economy. But it\u2019s worse than that. For a lot of powerful people it\u2019s easier to imagine deliberately intervening in the Earth\u2019s climate system through geoengineering\u2014trying to dim the sun and fertilize the ocean\u2014than it is to change the economic system in ways that would challenge the logic of unfettered growth. Think about that. It is seen now in many beltway circles to be more serious to talk about dimming the sun than to talk about saying no to fossil-fuel pipelines that aren\u2019t built yet. Shaban: Students across the U.S. are demanding that their universities divest their endowment holdings from fossil-fuel companies\u2014can you explain the long-term rationale for this kind of activism? Klein: I think that the divestment movement is really driven by a sense of what is right and wrong, what is moral and immoral. First and foremost, the divestment movement is about naming fossil-fuel profits as odious profits. In terms of an economic argument, it\u2019s less about bankrupting Exxon Mobile, or having a serious impact on the bottom lines of these companies, but they are part of a movement that is trying to delegitimize these companies and eventually turn them into the kinds of pariahs that tobacco companies became. That impacts politicians being willing to take fossil-fuel money, and could impact media outlets being willing to take fossil-fuel money. Many students who I talk to are most excited about the idea that they cannot only demand that their school divest from fossil fuels, but also that they invest that same money in a just transition away from fossil fuels. That\u2019s where you can start to have more of an impact, where alternatives become more economically viable and provide more competition for the fossil-fuel companies. Shaban: Why is the concept of global equity so important and why is it so difficult to enact in international negotiations? Klein: It\u2019s important for practical reasons because the issue of whether countries that started emitting first are going to start cutting first, whether there is going to be a transfer of resources to help the Global South leapfrog over fossil fuels and also adapt to heavier weather that\u2019s already locked in is always the central debate at every U.N. climate summit and always the issue over things breaking down. When the U.S. didn\u2019t ratify the Kyoto Protocol, this was the reason. It was because it was seen as unfair that China and India were not subject to the same emissions cuts because the U.S. is a country that always wants to pretend it was born yesterday, that history doesn\u2019t exist. This is a global challenge. It shows that we are connected. We all have our reasons to act equitably but it\u2019s extremely challenging. Shaban: One of the themes of your book is stitching together a grand political coalition that extends beyond the environmental movement. You suggest that we might be better off collectively demanding a minimum income than advocating for a carbon tax. Can you elaborate on this? Klein: If we were to adopt what the Europeans call a \u201cstrategic de-growth policy\u201d where we were to engage in that kind of serious transition and try to lower our emissions in line with what scientists are telling us, then we need to make sure we do that equitably. The only way you are going to have sign-on is if people are not being asked to choose between having a job and destabilizing a climate. One of the ways to do that is to have a stronger safety net, because when you have no safety net, and people\u2019s lives are much more precarious, they\u2019re going to be more prone to putting the immediate needs of feeding their family, entirely understandably, before what\u2019s seen as a longer term goal of making sure your kids have a stable climate to grow up in. So we need to introduce policies that give ourselves better choices. I think a much more plausible strategy is looking at the constituencies that are already engaged and already organized on a range of issues. They are fighting austerity, they are fighting for housing, they are fighting for healthcare, they are fighting against police brutality, and for immigration and for getting money out of politics, and it\u2019s important to find those intersections of places where there is common ground and to build a kind of umbrella movement that harnesses the urgency of the climate crisis.","headline":"Climate Change Is an Opportunity to Dramatically Reinvent the Economy","article_name":380429.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/09\/climate-change-is-an-opportunity-to-dramatically-reinvent-the-economy\/380429\/","date_published":"2014-09-19 11:30:00","article_length":11680,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:00.103231","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/09\/climate-change-is-an-opportunity-to-dramatically-reinvent-the-economy\/380429\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Studies have shown that improved access to birth control can be a valuable tool in slowing global warming, but many politicians are afraid to broach the subject. The equation seems fairly simple: The more the world's population rises, the greater the strain on dwindling resources and the greater the impact on the environment. The solution? Well, that's a little trickier to talk about. Public-health discussions will regularly include mentions of voluntary family planning as a way to reduce unwanted pregnancies and births. But, said Jason Bremner of the Population Reference Bureau, those policies can also pay dividends for the environment. \"And yet the climate-change benefits of family planning have been largely absent from any climate-change or family-planning policy discussions,\" he said. Bremner was speaking Tuesday at an event hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center, which has formed a working group of scientists and officials working on climate change and family planning to try to cross the gap between the two. Even as the population passes 7.2 billion and is projected by the United Nations to reach 10.9 billion by the end of the century, policymakers have been unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to discuss population in tandem with climate change. But there's been little or no funding for such programs, and the discussions tend to stall before getting into meaty policy. And despite the United Nations holding a special session on population and development a day before its September climate-change summit, academics lamented a lack of cross talk. Why? Talking about population control requires walking a tightrope: There's nuance between encouraging access to birth control and a China-style one-child policy, but that doesn't always translate in the retelling, and it can all too easily sound like a developed world leader telling people in the developing world that they should stop having children\u2014especially because much of the population boom is coming from regions like sub-Saharan Africa. And there's a coalition of critics ready to pounce on any speaker who slips, or even to twist the words of those who don't. Just look at what happened to Hillary Clinton in 2009, when as Secretary of State she acknowledged the overpopulation issue during a discussion with Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh. Clinton praised another panelist for noting \"that it's rather odd to talk about climate change and what we must do to stop and prevent the ill effects without talking about population and family planning.\" \"And yet, we talk about these things in very separate and often unconnected ways,\" Clinton added. Right-wing critics pounced, with the Alex Jones-run Info Wars calling her comments \"Malthusian.\" Oddly enough, Clinton has found herself criticized for falling on the other side of issue as well. In 2013, a line mentioning overpopulation was edited out of an essay for a Clinton-backed publication written by Bindi Irwin, the then-14-year-old daughter of the late \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin ( The Daily Mail chronicled the bizarre spat here ). But the Woodrow Wilson Institute researchers are quick to point out that they're not talking about touchy \"population control\" strategies like forced sterilization (prominently employed and quickly abandoned in India in the 1970s) or China's one-child policy. Rather, they're focusing on \"voluntary family planning\"\u2014emphasis on the \"voluntary\"\u2014programs that countries are already looking at. Sex education has been linked to reduced fertility rates, as has distribution of contraception. \"Achieving universal access to family planning throughout the world would result in fewer unintended pregnancies, improve the health and well-being of women and their families and slow population growth, all benefits to climate-compatible development,\" reads a draft statement from the group, which is crafting a full report to be released at the end of the year. The connection isn't necessarily new: Plenty of academics have made it, and Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke has blogged about it in the past. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has noted the burden of \"population pressures\" on natural resources, while separately looking at the health impact of family planning. Some national climate-adaptation plans around the world have brushed on family planning. A study from the Futures Group said it would cost $3.7 billion a year to provide such services to countries that don't yet have them. The public-health benefits of reducing unplanned pregnancies are clear for both mother and child, especially in high-risk impoverished areas. A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences looked at the link between policies that help women plan pregnancies and family size and global emissions (the study also looked at aging and urbanization trends). The researchers predicted that lower population growth could provide benefits equivalent to between 16 and 29 percent of the emissions reduction needed to avoid a 2 degrees Celsius warming by 2050, the warning line set by international scientists. But the benefits also come through easing the reduced resources that could result from climate change. The U.N. IPCC report notes the potential for climate-related food shortages, with fish catches falling anywhere from 40 to 60 percent and wheat and maize taking a hit, as well as extreme droughts. With resources already stretched in some areas, the IPCC laid out the potential for famine, water shortages and pestilence. Still, the link remains a \"very sensitive topic,\" said Karen Hardee, director of the Evidence Project at the nonprofit Population Council. \"At the global policy level you can't touch population \u2026 but what's been heartening is that over the last few years it's not just us, but people from the countries themselves talking about this,\" Hardee said. Hardee conducted a review of 41 National Adaptation Programs of Action (the vulnerability documents required of low-income nations by the U.N.) and found that 37 mentioned population as a climate-related problem. Of those, six recognized family planning as a possible mitigation technique. But none had funding for family-planning programs. And inclusion in a country-level plan doesn't translate to discussion at the international level, which is where the researchers say policy needs to be taking hold. The very idea of intervention has even gotten some recent pushback. A study published this month from two researchers at Australia's University of Adelaide also cast doubt on whether population control could even stem growth, projecting that even drastic measures like a one-child policy would result in a population between 5 and 10 billion by century's end. But the members of the Woodrow Wilson Center working group\u2014which includes members from the WorldWatch Institute and USAID, as well as climate scientists\u2014say their work can make waves, especially as world leaders prepare to meet for the U.N. climate summit in Paris next year. With countries already engaged on family planning, they say it's just a small leap to tie environmental concerns together. \"We want to achieve agreement on what the climate commitments are from individual countries,\" said Alexander Ochs of the Worldwatch Institute. \"There's a new opportunity here, a new approach that takes a bottom-up look at what countries want to bring to the table. \u2026 We're just focused now on getting over the stumbling blocks.\"","headline":"The Climate-Change Solution No One Will Talk About","article_name":382197.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2014\/11\/the-climate-change-solution-no-one-will-talk-about\/382197\/","date_published":"2014-11-01 13:00:00","article_length":7505,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:00.389973","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2014\/11\/the-climate-change-solution-no-one-will-talk-about\/382197\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Seven years ago, the presumptive Republican nominee called for urgent action to stop climate change. By its final year, it\u00a0was obvious that the 2000s were going to be the warmest\u00a0decade in history. 2005, after all, set records as\u00a0 the hottest year ever recorded . And 2007\u00a0was\u00a0 the second-hottest year \u2014until 2009 stole that record. 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 also all landed in the top-ten. Climate change was real,\u00a0its effects were felt planet-wide. But the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and its second-largest polluter, seemed to be doing little about it. Or maybe something was changing. In the autumn of 2009, climate-concerned Americans held out hope that progress might be made\u00a0at the\u00a0United Nations\u2019 annual climate conference,\u00a0planned for December\u00a0in Copenhagen. The new president,\u00a0Barack Obama, and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u00a0would be attending. It was the first time in eight years that a U.S. administration had recognized the reality of climate change. It was in\u00a0that environment that, in late November,\u00a0 a\u00a0full-page ad appeared in\u00a0 The New York Times . The ad, an open letter, called on President Obama and Congress to finally pass legislation\u00a0restricting greenhouse-gas emissions. \u201cWe support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today,\u201d it read. \u201cIf we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.\u201d Below that text were 55 names. They included\u00a0squishily\u00a0liberal\u00a0executives and various other famous people, like the\u00a0CEOs of Patagonia, Timberland, Blue Man Group, and Chipotle; and\u00a0Deepak Chopra,\u00a0Martha Stewart,\u00a0Kenneth Cole, and\u00a0Ben and Jerry. Someone else was on that list, too:\u00a0Donald J. Trump, and his three children. That\u2019s right: The Republican nominee for president\u00a0supported urgent climate action before he opposed it. The\u00a0full-page ad was forgotten \u00a0until it was\u00a0discovered this week by Ben Adler and Rebecca Leber, two journalists at the environmental-news site\u00a0 Grist. The Copenhagen talks ultimately came to very little.\u00a0Not until last year did the UN managed to\u00a0 produce\u00a0a successful\u00a0document \u00a0to halt climate change at its Paris conference.\u00a0Ironically, Trump promised to\u00a0 pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement \u00a0last month during his sole speech on energy policy. The speech\u00a0 didn\u2019t say much else about \u00a0climate change. As Adler and Leber write , Trump\u00a0flipped \u00a0on climate change long before his presidential run. Less than two months after that letter ran in the Times ,\u00a0 he had implied to \u00a0a crowd that\u00a0 global warming couldn\u2019t exist if snowfall was setting records. In 2012, he tweeted that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese. And though\u00a0he later said that tweet was a joke , Trump has regularly maintained that climate change doesn\u2019t exist or is a fraud . The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request\u00a0for comment about the open letter or the candidate\u2019s views on climate change. So first, let\u2019s state\u00a0unequivocally:\u00a097 percent\u00a0of actively publishing climate scientists\u00a0 understand global warming to be a real phenomenon, caused\u00a0by human activity. And every major American scientific organization, including the American Medical Association, has\u00a0 unambiguously\u00a0stated \u00a0that climate change is real,\u00a0caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and a threat to public health. Indeed, 2009-Trump might have said it best: Climate change is \u201cscientifically irrefutable.\u201d Now he seems to find it quite refutable.\u00a0But climate change wouldn\u2019t\u00a0be the first issue that Trump has flipped on or seemed to lie about. Trump endorsed\u00a0invading Iraq \u00a0on a national radio show in 2002; now he claims\u00a0 he opposed the invasion \u00a0long before the war began. He has lied about his relationship with former Libyan dictator\u00a0Muammar Qaddafi, a supporter of terrorism. And he has repeated\u00a0multiple inaccuracies \u00a0about the Trump University case . What exactly does Trump believe about the climate? To an outside observer, it almost\u2014 almost \u2014seems like Trump takes\u00a0the position that makes him look best\u00a0to a certain audience at a certain time. It almost seems like he can\u2019t stand to take a stand on anything:\u00a0Trump endorsed urgent climate action when the liberal CEOs came calling; now he rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change because, you know, he\u2019s\u00a0running as a Republican, and on climate change,\u00a0Republican politicians long ago stopped having to correspond to reality. During their presidencies,\u00a0Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush both took climate change seriously as a crisis.\u00a0An internal memo to Bush\u2019s secretary of state called climate change \u201cthe most far reaching environmental issue of our time\u201d and urged American leadership on the issue. The memo then quotes Secretary of State James A. Baker III\u2019s words back to him.\u00a0\u201cAs you yourself stated,\u201d it said , \u201cwe cannot wait until all the uncertainties have been resolved before we act to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare for whatever climate change we are already committed to.\u201d By the time Bush\u2019s son was president, American climate leadership was in retreat. Bush\u00a0pulled the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, the first emissions-restricting\u00a0climate treaty,\u00a0 under advisement from Exxon-Mobil . Republicans began to\u00a0deny that climate change existed at all.\u00a0And by the time this election rolled around, Senator Ted Cruz could cite\u00a0Galileo as a role model for his evidence-free\u00a0rejection of climate science. \u201cToday, the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers,\u201d Cruz\u00a0said . \u201cIt used to be [that] it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier.\u201d It\u2019s funny. Partisans regularly\u00a0quibble with this economist or that intellectual, suggesting why one\u00a0theory\u00a0of welfare, immigration, or\u00a0the market is more valid than another. And society is hard to study: It\u2019s\u00a0complex, culture-driven,\u00a0and impossible to run experiments on.\u00a0But the climate,\u00a0a vast and impersonal system, is simply a different kind of subject. Scientists can come to conclusions about the climate\u2019s operation in much clearer and difficult-to-dispute\u00a0ways than economists can come to conclusions about their chosen field.\u00a0Observation and commentary \u00a0do not alter the climate in the same way they alter\u00a0the economy.\u00a0And scientists are unified in their understanding that fossil fuel emissions are spurring the planet to get\u00a0warmer, leading to consequences that could be catastrophic within\u00a0our and our children\u2019s lifetimes. It\u2019s almost boring to note that the Republican Party, as an organization, has simply rejected these findings. (Sixty-eight percent of Republican representatives and senators reject anthropogenic climate change outright .)\u00a0But it is worth noting. It has made the party weak, subject to people like Trump, who know how to say the right thing to the right people.\u00a0And it has\u00a0put the party\u00a0on the wrong side of business interests and the free market: The solar industry already employs more people in this country than either the oil and gas\u00a0industry or the coal industry. Catching Trump in a double-bind, as\u00a0 Grist\u00a0 did, would be enjoyable if it weren\u2019t so serious. The United States really did postpone the Earth, as Trump and the progressive gang warned them not to in that\u00a0 Times\u00a0 ad seven years ago. Congress did not pass a market-based scheme to cap greenhouse-gas emissions during Obama\u2019s first term, and only\u00a0last year did the Obama administration introduce EPA regulations to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector. Yet climate change ground\u00a0on, unfeeling and uncaring about political gridlock or intransigence. And all those climate records set during the 2000s have passed away.\u00a0The three warmest years ever recorded are now considered to be 2014, 2015, and the one we\u2019re living in right now .","headline":"A Yuuuuuge Climate Flip Flop","article_name":486335.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/06\/trump-climate-change-new-york-times-letter-ad\/486335\/","date_published":"2016-06-10 12:00:00","article_length":7927,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:01.489192","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/06\/trump-climate-change-new-york-times-letter-ad\/486335\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new study suggests that giant bears, sloths, and saber-toothed cats died because warming temperatures cocked the gun, and people pulled the trigger. South America was once a land of giants. Its plains and forests were home to elephant-sized ground sloths , mace-tailed armadillos the size of a car, and huge creatures that resembled humpless camels . Hunting them were a large subspecies of jaguar, sabre-toothed cats, and the gigantic short-faced bear , several times heavier than a grizzly. All of these giants\u2014the aptly named megafauna\u2014are now gone. Why? In the 1930s, Junius Bird, an American archaeologist in the mold of Indiana Jones, found a clue in an innocuous rock shelter near the southernmost tip of Chile. Within it, he uncovered ancient knives, spear points, arrowheads and other stone tools, together with the bones of large animals like horses and lumbering ground sloths. Those discoveries, in what is now known as Fell\u2019s Cave , were among the first to suggest that prehistoric humans hunted the megafaunal menagerie to extinction. Paleontologists would soon level the same accusation at early humans from other continents, where titans like mammoths and woolly rhinos also disappeared. Meanwhile, South America remained neglected. It wasn\u2019t clear when the continent\u2019s giants disappeared, or why. \u201cTraditionally, it\u2019s been this mystery area,\u201d says Alan Cooper form the University of Adelaide. But it\u2019s a mystery that his team, including climatologist Chris Turney and evolutionary biologists Jessica Metcalf and Ross Barnett , have come closer to solving. By analyzing the DNA from bones and teeth recovered from sites around Fell\u2019s cave, the team showed that many other animals went extinct alongside the horses and sloths that Bird discovered. These included a species of llama and a giant subspecies of jaguar. During the process, they used carbon-dating to check how old the fossils were. \u201cWe noticed that the dates coming back were grouping together quite tightly,\u201d says Cooper. The llama and jaguar, along with the ground sloth, saber-toothed cat, short-faced bear, and South American horse all lived until around 12,300 years ago, and then disappeared. It was as if they had simultaneously crashed into an invisible wall. They all existed, and then they all didn\u2019t. Why? Humans seemed like unlikely culprits. Archaeological evidence from other caves show that people were living in southern Chile by at least 14,600 years ago, and co-existed with the megabeasts for a couple of millennia. \u201cYou\u2019ve got humans knocking at the gates of Patagonia well before the extinction,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt\u2019s not a blitzkrieg. It\u2019s anything but.\u201d A changing climate was a more likely suspect. The team noticed that the giant beasts went extinct a few centuries after a prolonged cold spell that gripped Patagonia between 14,400 and 12,700 years ago. As the glaciers retreated and temperatures rose, the giant beasts disappeared. \u201cThat\u2019s a clear signal. Humans arrive. It gets cold. Nothing happens for 2,000 years,\u201d says Cooper. But once temperatures started climbing again, \u201cbam, the megafauna are dead very quickly.\u201d While South America was going through its cold spell, North America was warm. And when the south heated up, the north cooled. The two sister continents see-sawed in climate but in both cases, the big animals disappeared during the warming stints. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as you can get to a replicated experiment,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cCold equals okay, warming equals death.\u201d Why did warming climates doom the megafauna? It\u2019s not clear, but Cooper has some guesses. The rising temperatures brought summer droughts, variable rainfall, and other weather anomalies. They also fueled the rapid growth of forests, which broke up the open habitats that these large animals were used to. And within that changing landscape, there were people, armed with bows and spears. They may have grown faster, or roamed over greater distances. Their populations could have boomed. They might have found it easier to kill the megafauna, which had been herded into ever narrower ranges. And in a newly fragmented world, there was no way for distant populations of hunted beasts to replace those that had been hunted out. This fits with a growing sense from other parts of the world that neither climate change nor humans was solely responsible for killing the megafauna. Instead, they acted synergistically. \u201cWarming might be the magic ingredient that activates or accelerates our natural destructive tendencies,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cOr cold shuts us down.\u201d Either way, climate change cocked the gun, and people pulled the trigger. \u201cThe evidence from the fossil record demonstrates the rapidity with which extinctions can occur and ecosystems can collapse when species are squeezed by multiple stressors that limit their ability to track habitat changes,\u201d says Elizabeth Jeffers from Oxford University. And \u201cthese processes\u2014rapid climate warming and habitat fragmentation by humans\u2014are occurring today,\u201d Thanks to us, the world is getting warmer, and large animals like elephants and rhinos are dying out. These are typically regarded as independent crises, caused by greenhouse gases and poaching respectively. But maybe the death of today\u2019s giants is partly driven by the same warming-related strife that doomed their prehistoric counterparts. \u201cIt becomes really pressing to work out what aspects of warming allow humans to be that much more destructive than normal,\u201d Cooper says.","headline":"How Climate Change Unleashed Humans Upon South America\u2019s Megabeasts","article_name":487502.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/06\/how-climate-change-unleashed-humans-upon-south-americas-megabeasts\/487502\/","date_published":"2016-06-17 18:00:00","article_length":5468,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:02.095231","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/06\/how-climate-change-unleashed-humans-upon-south-americas-megabeasts\/487502\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The former oilman downplayed humanity\u2019s responsibility for raising the global thermostat on Wednesday. As chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson admitted that climate change is real. In January 2009, he said the company was in favor of a carbon tax. A few years later, Exxon endorsed the Paris Agreement. It was never clear whether Exxon\u2019s leaders actually supported those policies or whether they were trying to put their best PR foot forward (or whether it mattered either way). But now Tillerson is the Secretary of State-designate for a man who not only rejects the Paris treaty, but who also once tweeted that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. What does Tillerson really think about global warming\u2014and will it matter? On Wednesday, at his ongoing confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we\u2019ve gotten four big glances at his views on the issue: 1. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat of New Mexico, pressed Tillerson to share his \u201cpersonal view\u201d of climate change. Tillerson replied that after 20 years as a scientist and engineer, he had concluded that \u201cthe risk of climate change does exist.\u201d He also believed \u201caction should be taken,\u201d though he neither went into detail nor left the passive voice. \u201cDo you believe that human activity, based on science, is contributing?\u201d asked Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThe increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited,\u201d Tillerson answered. A few notes here. First, as Inside Climate News points out , Tillerson never connected emissions from fossil fuels to the rise in greenhouse-gas levels. But oil, gas, and coal combustion contribute not only most of the ongoing global warming but also all of the ongoing ocean acidification . Second, Tillerson is careful to frame climate change as a future risk and not an ongoing reality. Yet the last three years have been the warmest ever recorded , and the U.S. East Coast is already seeing elevated sea levels , especially in South Florida . Most scientists also feel quite certain about many of the ill effects of climate change. Still, it pointed to a potential shift in the Republican Party\u2019s treatment of climate change. If some party members stop debating whether global warming is real ( it is ), and begin discussing what to do about it, the odd politics of the issue in the United States could begin to change. 2. Tillerson made comments about international climate treaties that\u2014in any reasonable reading\u2014do not agree with those of Donald Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. No one country is going to solve this alone,\u201d he said. Immediately after Trump\u2019s victory, there were hints that he may direct the United States to leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the overarching (and Congressionally ratified) treaty to address global warming. It\u2019s hard to reconcile the U.S. \u201cmaintaining its seat at the table\u201d with its abandoning the UNFCCC, as that would leave the U.S. unable to attend the UN\u2019s annual meeting on climate change. It\u2019s less clear what his comment means for the Paris Agreement. Since presidents ultimately set all policy, it\u2019s also unclear whether Tillerson\u2019s opinions about climate diplomacy may matter. But as the leader of an American business, it makes sense that he would see American engagement in global affairs as worthwhile. 3. Tillerson clarified his support for a carbon tax. When he announced Exxon\u2019s endorsement of a carbon tax on January 9, 2009 , it was because he opposed the incoming Obama administration\u2019s plans for a cap-and-trade plan, he told the committee. Back then, he called a carbon tax \u201ca more direct, a more transparent, and a more effective approach.\u201d He largely echoed that reasoning on Wednesday. \u201cIt replaces the hodgepodge of approaches we have today, which are scattered. Some of which are through mandates, some of which are well-intended, but ineffective incentives,\u201d Tillerson told Udall. He also liked that a carbon tax would not increase the size of the government. \u201cIf a carbon tax is put in place, it has to be revenue-neutral. All the revenues have to go back out to the economy through reduced employee payroll taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is simply a mechanism to incentivize choices that people are making. It\u2019s not a revenue-raiser.\u201d Tillerson did not commit to working for a carbon tax while secretary of state. 4. Tillerson got the senators to laugh about the notion of harassing the civil service. In early December, the Trump transition team circulated a survey among employees at the Department of Energy. It sought to learn , among other things, about which employees had worked on or studied climate issues and about who had attended international climate meetings with Obama political appointees. In response to ferocious opposition , the transition team withdrew the survey later that week . At the hearing, Udall asked Tillerson whether he would seek out or persecute State Department employees who had worked on climate issues for the Obama administration. \u201cNo sir, that\u2019d be a pretty unhelpful way to get started,\u201d replied Rex. The committee chuckled. Amid all of this, the loudest voice in the room about climate change wasn\u2019t from a senator or the nominee. Throughout the morning, protesters stood up in the gallery and shouted their opposition to the proceedings. \u201cExxon wants to drill and burn the Arctic,\u201d yelled a woman with graying hair. \u201cPlease don\u2019t put Exxon in charge of the State Department. Protect our children and grandchildren!\u201d she shouted. A Capitol Police officer escorted her out. Corker said he would \u201cstop the clock\u201d and allow senators their full questioning time whenever the proceedings were interrupted. The hearing continued.","headline":"Rex Tillerson Says Climate Change Is Real, but \u2026","article_name":512843.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/rex-tillerson-climate-change\/512843\/","date_published":"2017-01-11 19:25:00","article_length":5963,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:02.334819","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/rex-tillerson-climate-change\/512843\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Guest post by Jonathan H. Adler, a\u00a0 professor \u00a0at the\u00a0 Case Western Reserve University School of Law \u00a0 and regular contributor to the\u00a0 Volokh Conspiracy No environmental issue is more polarizing than global climate change. \u00a0Many on the left fear increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases threaten an environmental apocalypse while many on the right believe anthropogenic global warming is much ado about nothing and, at worst, a hoax. \u00a0Both sides pretend as if the climate policy debate is, first and foremost, about science, rather than policy. This is not so. There is substantial uncertainty about the scope, scale, and consequences of anthropogenic warming, and will be for some time, but this is not sufficient justification for ignoring global warming or pretending that climate change is not a serious problem. Though my political leanings are most definitely right-of-center, and it would be convenient to believe otherwise , I believe there is sufficient evidence that global warming is a serious environmental concern. \u00a0I have worked on this issue for twenty years, including a decade at the Competitive Enterprise Institute where I edited this book . \u00a0I believe human activities have contributed to increases in greenhouse concentrations, and these increases can be expected to produce a gradual increase in global mean temperatures. While substantial uncertainties remain as to the precise consequences of this increase and consequent temperature rise, there is reason to believe many of the effects will be quite negative. \u00a0Even if some parts of the world were to benefit from a modest temperature increase -- due to, say, a lengthened growing season -- others will almost certainly lose. Many so-called skeptics note that environmental activists and some climate scientists exaggerate\u00a0the likely effects of anthropogenic warming, distorting scientific findings \u00a0and overstating the extent to which contemporary events ( hurricanes , etc.) may be linked to human activity to date. \u00a0But the excesses of climate activists and bad behavior by politically active scientists (and the IPCC ) do not, and should not, discredit the underlying science, or justify excoriating those who reach a different conclusion . \u00a0Indeed, most skeptics within the scientific community readily accept the basic science. \u00a0They contest the more extreme climate projections, but accept the basic scientific claims. Take, for example, Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute. \u00a0In one of his recent books, Climate of Extremes: The Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know (co-authored with Robert Balling, another prominent \"skeptic\"), Michaels readily acknowledges that there is a warming trend and that human activity shares some of the blame. The position espoused by Michaels, Balling and most (but not all) skeptics is that anthropogenic global warming is occurring, but it is more of a nuisance than a catastrophe. \u00a0Some even argue that the net effect of climate change on the world will be positive, due to increased growing seasons, less severe winters and the like. \u00a0Were I a utilitarian, and if I placed substantial faith in such cost-benefit studies, I might find these arguments convincing, but I'm not and I don't. \u00a0Even if these skeptics are correct that global warming will not be catastrophic and that the net effects in the near-to-medium term might be positive, there are still reasons to act. Accepting, for the sake of argument, that the skeptics' assessment of the science is correct, global warming will produce effects that should be of concern. \u00a0Among other things, even a modest increase in global temperature can be expected to produce some degree of sea-level rise, with consequent negative effects on low-lying regions. \u00a0Michaels and Balling, for instance, have posited a \"best guess\" that sea levels will rise 5 to 11 inches over the next century. \u00a0Such an increase in sea levels is likely manageable in wealthy, developed nations, such as the United States. \u00a0Poorer nations in the developing world, however, will not be so able to adapt to such changes. \u00a0This is of particular concern because these effects will be most severe in those nations that are both least able to adapt and least responsible for contributing to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is a well established principle in the Anglo-American legal tradition that one does not have the right to use one's own property in a manner that causes harm to one's neighbor. \u00a0There are common law cases gong back 400 years establishing this principle and international law has long embraced a similar norm. \u00a0As I argued at length in this paper , if we accept this principle, even non-catastrophic warming should be a serious concern, as even non-catastrophic warming will produce the sorts of consequences that have long been recognized as property rights violations, such as the flooding of the land of others. My argument is that the same general principles that lead libertarians and conservatives to call for greater protection of property rights should lead them to call for greater attention to the most likely effects of climate change. \u00a0It is a well recognized principle of common law that if company A is flooding the land of person B, it is irrelevant whether company A generates lots of economic prosperity for the local community (including B). \u00a0A's action would still violate B's property rights, and B would be entitled to relief of some sort. \u00a0By the same token, if the land of a farmer in Bangladesh is flooded, due in measurable and provable part to human-induced climate change, why would he be any less entitled to redress than a farmer who has his land flooded by his neighbor's land-use changes? Property rights should not be sacrificed as part of some utilitarian calculus. \u00a0Libertarians readily accept this principle when government planners violate property rights in the name of economic development (see e.g., Kelo v. New London ). \u00a0Yet they seem to abandon their commitment to property rights when it comes to global warming. I readily recognize that there is, as yet, no international mechanism that adjudicate warming-based disputes, and I am quite sympathetic to those who believe any international entity capable of adjudicating such disputes would do more harm than good, but this does not negate the principle that global warming is, as best we can tell, likely to cause harms that should be addressed. \u00a0The question is how to do it. Accepting that global warming is a serious problem does not require the embrace of federal regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, as currently undertaken by the EPA. \u00a0I have been quite critical of these efforts, which I believe are based on a misinterpretation of the Act by the Supreme Court. \u00a0CAA regulation will be extremely costly but will not produce emission reductions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. \u00a0The pork-laden \u00a0 cap-and-trade legislation passed by the House of Representatives would not be much better. \u00a0What then should we do? If the effects of global warming are to be mitigated, it is necessary to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a reasonable level. \u00a0The emission reductions necessary for this to be achieved are enormous, and far beyond the capability of existing technologies. \u00a0Just to reach a reasonable intermediate target the U.S. would have to reduce its emissions to levels not seen in 100 years, and reduce per capita emissions to levels not seen since Reconstruction. \u00a0And even this would not be enough, for if equivalent emission reductions are not made elsewhere, it would all be for naught. \u00a0As I explain in the first part of this paper , dramatic technological innovation is necessary to address the threat of climate change. As Roger Pielke Jr. persuasively argues in his book  The Climate Fix , nations will not decarbonize their economies until it is relatively cheap and easy to do so. \u00a0Therefore, those who are concerned about climate change, as I am, should be pursuing policies that will make it cheaper and easier to adopt low-carbon technologies. \u00a0What should these policies be? \u00a0I've suggested several. First, the federal government should support technology inducement prizes to encourage the development of commercially viable low-carbon technologies. \u00a0For reasons I explain in this paper , such prizes are likely to yield better results at lower cost than traditional government R&D funding or regulatory mandates that seek to spur innovation. Second, the federal government should seek to identify and reduce barriers to the development and deployment of alternative technologies . \u00a0Whatever the economic merits of the Cape Wind project, it is ridiculous that it could take over a decade for a project such as this to go through the state and federal permitting processes. \u00a0This sort of regulatory environment discourages private investment in these technologies. Third, I believe the United States should adopt a revenue-neutral carbon tax, much like that suggested by NASA's James Hansen . \u00a0Specifically, the federal government should impose a price on carbon that is fully rebated to taxpayers on a per capita basis. \u00a0This would, in effect, shift the incidence of federal taxes away from income and labor and onto energy consumption and offset some of the potential regressivity of a carbon tax. \u00a0For conservatives who have long supported shifting from an income tax to a sales or consumption tax, and oppose increasing the federal tax burden, this should be a no brainer. \u00a0If fully rebated, there is no need to worry about whether the government will put the resulting revenues to good use, but the tax would provide a significant incentive to reduce carbon energy use. \u00a0Further, a carbon tax would be more transparent and less vulnerable to rent-seeking and special interest mischief than equivalent cap-and-trade schemes and would also be easier to account for within the global trading system. \u00a0All this means a revenue-neutral carbon tax could be easier to enact than cap-and-trade. \u00a0And as for a broader theoretical justification, if the global atmosphere is a global commons owned by us all, why should not those who use this commons to dispose of their carbon emissions pay a user fee to compensate those who are affected. Fourth and finally, it is important to recognize that some degree of warming is already hard-wired into the system. \u00a0This means that some degree of adaptation will be necessary. \u00a0Yet as above, recognizing the reality of global warming need not justify increased federal control over the private economy. \u00a0There are many market-oriented steps that can, and should, be taken to increase the country's ability to adapt to climate change including, as I've argued here and here , increased reliance upon water markets, particularly in the western United States where the effects of climate change on water supplies are likely to be most severe. I recognize that a relatively brief post like this is unlikely to convince many people who have set positions on climate change. \u00a0I can already anticipate a comment thread filled with charges and counter-charges over the science. \u00a0But I hope this post has helped illustrate that the embrace of limited government principles need not entail the denial of environmental claims and that a concern for environmental protection need not lead to an ever increasing mound of prescriptive regulation. \u00a0And for those who wish to explore these arguments in further detail, there's lots more in the links I've provided throughout this post.","headline":"A Conservative's Approach to Combating Climate Change","article_name":257827.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2012\/05\/a-conservatives-approach-to-combating-climate-change\/257827\/","date_published":"2012-05-30 15:11:00","article_length":11624,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:02.866474","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2012\/05\/a-conservatives-approach-to-combating-climate-change\/257827\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Areas of the country Trump won by large margins are particularly vulnerable to the environmental devastation wrought by climate change. On the heels of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this Monday with environmentalist and former vice president Al Gore, 97 percent of the world\u2019s scientists might have breathed (just a little) easier. Here was a signal\u2014however tentative\u2014that the incoming president was at least interested in hearing the views of those who consider climate change to be a looming threat, and who would prefer the United States do something about it. The meeting, as my colleague Robinson Meyer writes , was arranged by the first daughter, Ivanka Trump. Presumably, it is part of a reported effort to make climate change \u201cone of her signature issues\u201d in a bid to win over \u201cliberals disgusted and depressed with the tone and tenor of the new leader of the free world.\u201d It is worth noting that not only liberals are concerned with climate change: According to Gallup , 40 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of independents are \u201cworried a great or fair deal\u201d about it, an increase of nine points since the question was asked last year. And then there\u2019s the rest of the world, where not only is the existence of climate change broadly agreed upon , but is seen as a something that must be combatted\u2014which is why nearly the entire planet signed on to the Paris climate-change accords earlier this year. To be clear: Ivanka Trump\u2019s potential \u201coutreach\u201d on the subject would be as much international diplomacy as it would be an olive branch to distressed Democrats and concerned Republicans. But other indicators relating to the incoming administration do not bode as well for those who care about the warming of the earth\u2019s surface: Myron Ebell, a prominent climate-change denier , continues to head the Trump transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. And The New York Times yesterday reported that: Among Mr. Trump\u2019s current top candidates for E.P.A. administrator are Jeffrey Holmstead, a lead lawyer representing states and fossil fuel companies suing to overturn Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations; Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, who has been a key architect of that legal fight; and Kathleen Hartnett White, the director of a Texas think tank who served as a top environmental official under the former Texas governors Rick Perry and George W. Bush. Ms. White has denounced \u201cglobal warming alarmism\u201d and called last year\u2019s international Paris Agreement on climate change a \u201ctragedy.\u201d The environmental picture remains equally grim over at the Interior Department, where the incoming president is considering appointing Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, a strong critic of the clean power regulations set in place by the Obama administration, and a forceful advocate for oil and gas. Remember, this is the governor who responded to a question about climate change\u2014and whether it was to blame for a prolonged and historic drought that was crippling her state\u2014in 2013: It's just nature itself and the patterns that flow and so we're going to continue to pray for rain in the state of Oklahoma and hope we that we get some relief. At this point, no one can know where the Trump White House will land on a number\u00a0 of environmental concerns, but what we do know is this: The men and women who are likely to feel the most catastrophic effects of a warming planet are not West Coast Gore acolytes or compost-obsessed Northeastern liberals. The people on the front lines of climate change in the America are Trump voters: residents of the deep-red states in the Southeastern United States. Last year, an initiative called Risky Business , put together by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and the philanthropist Tom Steyer, released a report detailing the catastrophic effects of a changing climate on various regions of the United States. The Southeast\u2014precisely the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia\u2014is, according to Kate Gordon, editor of that report, \u201cthe most vulnerable.\u201d Gordon explained that, \u201cthe global South starts to encroach in the U.S. through the Southeast.\u201d Excepting Virginia (which Clinton won), these are also states where Trump claimed victory, mostly by very large margins. In Alabama and Arkansas, states Trump won by nearly 30 points each, temperatures are expected to soar in the coming years, thanks to climate changes as the result of increased greenhouse-gas emissions. Since 1980, the typical Alabaman has experienced an average of 12 days per year of temperatures above 95 degrees, while the typical Arkansan has had 19 days of it. According to the report, by 2050, there may be as many as 75 days of 95-plus degree heat. In Arkansas, over the same time frame, there may be as many as 82 days of scorching heat\u2014a nearly three-month long heat wave. The same goes for Mississippi, where Trump won by nearly 18 points and where, on average, residents experience of 13 days per year of 95-plus degree heat. The state is on track to reach up to 85 days of those temperatures by 2050. The effects of this heat are not simply discomfort, according to the report. In Texas, where Trump won by over 9 points and where the typical year sees an average of 43 days above 95 degrees, by 2040-2058, that number is likely to reach up to 106 days per year. In tandem with this, heat-related deaths are likely to increase by more than 4,500 in the same frame, the report projects. In a state like Florida, which Trump won narrowly, nearly one-fifth of the population is over the age of 64. With the largest share of elderly residents in the country, the effects of extreme and prolonged heat in Florida could be devastating: By mid-century, Florida is projected to have as many as 5,080 additional annual deaths, of which 90 percent are expected to affect people over age 64. Prolonged high temperatures will take a toll on the state\u2019s energy grids, which will be taxed with over-consumption, necessitated by over-reliance on air conditioning\u2014and state energy costs are expected to rise by billions of dollars, come mid-century. Worker productivity will also decline. Remember, Gordon told me, these are states where \u201cit gets really hot and humid, so you have heat stroke issues.\u201d State economies will equally be under pressure: Increased temperatures would have potentially devastating effects on the agriculture industries. Currently, Tennessee (which Trump won by nearly 25 points) has more than 79,000 farms, which cover more than 40 percent of the state\u2019s land area. Among the crops grown in the state are corn and soybeans, both of which, Gordon said, \u201care very vulnerable\u201d to climate change. \u00a0Without significant agricultural adaptation, Tennessee\u2019s soybean yields will drop by as much as 31 percent by mid-century; corn yields may plummet by as much as 47 percent. In Alabama, where soybeans were the state\u2019s second most valuable crop, absent significant agricultural adaptation, soybean yields will likely decrease by as much as 44 percent by midcentury. In Arkansas, corn yields will likely decrease by up to 59 percent in the following 20 years, so long as nothing is done to adapt the industry. Georgia, which Trump won by 5 points, is the country\u2019s largest producer of broiler chickens. (Alabama is second and Arkansas is third.) According to the report: Because poultry flocks can only tolerate narrow temperature ranges, higher temperatures can disrupt performance, production, and fertility, limiting a bird\u2019s ability to produce meat or eggs. Higher temperatures can also increase animal mortality. In addition, climate change can affect the price and availability of water, feed grains and pasture, and change patterns of animal diseases. And because energy costs comprise more than 50% of growers\u2019 cash expenses, higher energy costs due to climate change have the potential to put additional pressure on this sector. Some crops that are grown in the region, like wheat, may have increased yields due to increased carbon levels in the atmosphere, but Gordon cautioned, \u201cthe report wasn\u2019t exhaustive [in its breakdown]. Heat and humidity bring new insect species and things like mold\u201d\u2014both of which can have devastating effects on crops and livestock. And then there is the issue of the coast. The southeast, Gordon told me, \u201chas the worst sea level rise in the U.S.\u201d That is due to a number of factors, she explained, including, \u201cthe way land is at bottom the of ocean, geological formations, and Arctic versus Antarctic melt.\u201d Whatever the reason, this part of the country is on track to lose considerable (and valuable) coastal real estate with rising seas. In North Carolina, where Trump beat Clinton by almost 3 points, according to the report: By 2030, up to $4.4 billion in coastal property is likely to be flooded at high tide. By 2050, the value of property below the mean high water mark will likely increase to up to $5.6 billion. In South Carolina, where Trump won by over 4 points, the projection is almost identical: By mid-century, an additional $5.7 billion of South Carolina property is expected to be below the mean high-water mark. Louisiana, which Trump won by 20 points, faces the highest rate of sea level rise in the United States. If the country continues on its current emissions path, the mean sea level at Grand Isle, Louisiana, is likely to rise 1.9 to 2.4 feet by 2050\u2014and 4.1 to 5.8 feet by the end of the century. Mean sea-level impacts are similarly dire: By 2050, $44.8 billion worth of Louisiana property could be below mean sea level. But nowhere is this picture more grim than in Florida: According to projections, by 2050, about $152 billion worth of property in the state will be below local high-tide levels. Water problems caused by a changing climate will be particularly unkind to this section of the country: Storm surge and nuisance flooding will increase. Subsequent flooding of the Mississippi River will slow transportation of goods, complicating supply chains. And droughts elsewhere are projected to wreak havoc on the water-intensive oil and gas industries. Some of the most immediate projections included in the report will come to pass no matter who is in the White House and what their climate agenda happens to be, according to Gordon. \u201cThe heat and sea level rise impact\u2014that\u2019s baked into next 10-20 years. That\u2019s the result of emissions we put in the atmosphere,\u201d she said.\u201cBut 2040 and 2050 we could actually affect.\u201d The coming years, \u201care critical for mitigation in the next 30 years. And frankly, for adapting\u2014which you cannot ignore.\u201d To some degree, the president-elect can trust that states will continue to combat climate change on their own (as California has done ), regardless of what his environmental agencies unwind or reverse in terms of environmental regulation. But state action and industry reform are not a substitute for a national policy (nor international policy). And having an administration that acknowledges the reality of climate change\u2014and the significant threat it poses\u2014will be imperative in the medium and long term. \u201cWe have to accept\u2014and we have to have as a fundamental narrative in this country\u2014that climate change is a serious economic and security risk and needs to be addressed,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cWe need to be global and local in addressing this issue.\u201d Trump thus far has shown haphazard allegiance to the voters who swept him into office: He appears intent to follow through on his populist promise to prevent companies from moving American jobs overseas, but he aims to fill his cabinet with billionaires whose track records display little concern for the same working class voters whose fortunes most depend on Trump\u2019s commitment to populism. Despite the fact that a significant part of his voting base, the Southeast United States, lies at the frontline of the climate battle, this region\u2019s residents have not been vocal about the peril they face\u2014indeed, its state leaders have been downright skeptical about the very existence of the threat. Without a sizable and voluble coalition of his own supporters engaged on the issue, it is hard to imagine this particular president caring much at all. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, its unclear how beholden Trump might feel to them in the long-term. Perhaps the best hope for the millions of Americans\u2014and billions of people around the world\u2014concerned about the threat of climate change is that Trump\u2019s preoccupation with the fizzy high of positive press, coupled with his daughter\u2019s apparent desire to find common ground with Democrats, will result in something other than climate denialism and the unwinding of critically-important regulatory reform. As it concerns the environment, the country has little idea of \u00a0where it is headed in the short-term\u2014even if there is broad consensus as to where it may end up in the long-term.","headline":"Red States in the Hot Seat","article_name":509744.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2016\/12\/trump-voters-in-the-hot-seat\/509744\/","date_published":"2016-12-07 14:23:32","article_length":12991,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:03.449935","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2016\/12\/trump-voters-in-the-hot-seat\/509744\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies announced that 2010 had registered as the hottest year on record. Nothing new here: nine of the last 10 years have been among the warmest ever. The news highlighted one of Washington's biggest failures over the last two years: its inability to advance climate legislation. It was also a grim reminder that things could get worse. Some crucial policy areas have always been neglected and some initiatives stalled. But rarely has a first-order concern like the nation's climate and energy policy actually regressed -- and so dramatically as we've seen since the last presidential election. Not long ago, it appeared likely that the United States would take meaningful action to mitigate climate change. In the 2008 presidential campaign, both Barack Obama and John McCain touted plans to limit carbon emissions under a cap-and-trade scheme. Even Sarah Palin supported the idea. Much of the business community did, too. Adding momentum was the recent Supreme Court ruling, in Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency, that required the EPA, under the Clean Air Act, to regulate harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Lawmakers, it was presumed, would take the matter into their own hands rather than cede that authority. Of course, this didn't happen. Over the strenuous objections of Republicans and coal-state Democrats, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and trade bill in 2009 that met an ignominious death in the Senate. Along the way, cap-and-trade -- originally a conservative idea -- came to be vilified as \"cap and tax'' and regarded by a substantial part of the conservative base as a form of fascist oppression. Today, fewer Americans believe in the reality of global warming than did so two years ago, and many took out their wrath last November on Democrats who'd supported a climate bill. But this doesn't capture the full scale of the setback. Since that debacle, momentum in Congress has shifted strongly against climate-change legislation. If you want to frighten one of the remaining Democrats, suggest that he or she take another shot at passing cap-and-trade. There's still the EPA. When both parties favored cap-and-trade, this option was viewed as the less desirable one. The agency could limit greenhouse gas emissions, but not through a system as flexible and efficient as cap-and-trade, which included simple improvements like building-efficiency standards that lay beyond the agency's remit. EPA regulations would thus be less effective. The cap-and-trade bill that passed the House aimed to reduce emissions 17 percent by 2020 from their 2005 levels. A World Resources Institute study found that the most aggressive implementation of EPA regulations would only reduce emissions by 12 percent in that time frame. Scientists say reductions of 36-48 percent would be necessary to halt global warming. \"Having EPA set carbon-pollution reductions was everyone's second choice for slowing global warming,'' said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \"It was like 'In Case of Congressional Gridlock Break Glass.' '' Now, the backup plan is the only plan, and \"aggressive'' regulations are off the table. Last year, the EPA issued a \"tailoring rule'' signaling how it intended to proceed. The results in no way resembled the fears expressed by many detractors that a burdensome new system of regulations would be imposed on small businesses. Instead, the EPA will confine its attentions strictly to the largest polluters, such as power plants, oil refineries, and chemical manufacturers. These modest steps won't do nearly as much to slow global warming as the other, broader plans. But because the battle has shifted from the legislative to the regulatory front, the EPA nonetheless finds itself under attack from the newly empowered Republicans. One of the first things they will do is try to block EPA from establishing pollution standards, possibly by denying funds or refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless the process is slowed or halted. It's not clear whether they'll succeed. But given the heightened importance of stronger restrictions, environmentalists can't feel good about recent developments. Earlier this week, the Obama administration said it would focus on eliminating regulations, rather than strengthening them. That's probably an accurate reading of the political climate. But for the planet's climate, it's yet another blow. Joshua Green writes a weekly column for the Boston Globe.

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change is ever more destructive. Why aren\u2019t we heeding nature\u2019s warnings? \r\n Lately, it seems, Mother Nature has been trying to get our attention. Its signals are increasingly loud, strident, and hard to miss. Some have been lethal. The year 2015 is poised to become the hottest on record. In October, Hurricane Patricia, the strongest hurricane ever recorded by meteorologists, produced winds that reached 200 miles per hour. Average temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing twice as fast as temperatures on the rest of the planet. This, in turn, contributes to the thawing of the ice-covered polar surface\u2014ice cover that is shrinking by 9 percent every 10 years . Scientists expect polar thawing to raise sea levels to a point that will force the population of many highly urbanized coastal areas to move to higher ground. More relevant for Americans is the fact that the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica is melting as warm ocean water erodes it from underneath. Owing to the laws of gravity, this could elevate sea levels by at least 11 feet in the Northern Hemisphere; in the United States, sea levels could rise by 25 percent more than the global average. A recent study indicated that by the end of the century, some urban centers in the Persian Gulf will occasionally be afflicted with temperature and humidity levels \u201cthat are intolerable to humans\u201d\u2014a threat Southeast Asia also faces . In these studies, \u201cintolerable\u201d does not mean very unpleasant. It potentially means mortal danger to those who are exposed, even for a few hours, to these conditions. According to the United Nations , the current number of storms, floods, and heat waves is five times greater than it was in 1970. Although this increase should be partially attributed to the fact that we have better data now than we did half a century ago, numerous studies point to the heightened frequency these days of extreme weather phenomena: abnormally high or low temperatures, torrential rains, mudslides, prolonged droughts, and fierce forest fires. The number of people displaced by the effects of climate change is now greater than ever before. The International Red Cross estimates that there are more environmental refugees than there are political refugees escaping wars and other forms of conflict. After decades of intense debate, an overwhelming majority of scientists now agree that these changes in the earth\u2019s climate are caused by an increase in the emissions of certain gases (especially carbon dioxide, or CO2) produced by human activities. There is still some residual skepticism about this conclusion, some of which results from honest and healthy disagreements among experts. Unfortunately, however, there are also  plenty of biased \u201cscientific studies\u201d financed by corporations and other parties, which benefit from current patterns of energy production and consumption and fight any reforms bound to affect their interests. But despite these various distress signals, humanity has hitherto been unable to alter its current, disastrous path toward a warmer planet. This lack of effective action is not just due to certain corporations and countries pushing their fossil fuel-oriented agendas at the expense of the common good. It is also due to human nature. Put simply: Humans have a hard time changing their habits and routines. People who go on weight-loss diets tend to abandon the effort before accomplishing their goals, or to gradually gain back the weight they lost as they return to their old ways of eating. Tobacco smokers similarly struggle to break their nicotine addiction. A health scare is often the surest way to change behavior and renounce unhealthy lifestyles. Surviving a heart attack, for example, can do wonders to make people stop smoking, eat healthier foods, and exercise more often. Will it take a devastating, large-scale climate incident to curb CO2 emissions and change the ways we treat our planet? So far, it looks that way. After all, carbon addiction is rampant in today\u2019s world. The way we light, heat, and cool our homes and offices; our means of transportation; the way our cities are built; the products we consume, from plastics to hamburgers\u2014all require a high consumption of carbon that, once fed into the atmosphere as CO2, contributes to global warming and climate chaos. The most obvious reason why breaking the world\u2019s carbon addiction has proven so difficult is that doing so demands a collective and multinational effort, sustained in perpetuity. If sticking to a diet is difficult for a person, it is far more difficult for countries tasked with acting in concert with one another. Some countries will cheat. Others will demand that the diet followed by the rich and fat be more stringent than that adhered to by the poor and slim. Still others will request that the most onerous diet fall to those that have indulged themselves longest; developing nations like China and India, for instance, argue that they deserve a lighter low-carbon diet than countries that have been polluting the planet and its atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. In December, the UN will host a climate-change conference in Paris, one that promises\u2014\u201cpromises\u201d being the operative word\u2014to yield more progress than more than two decades\u2019 worth of such gatherings . But in this case, success has been defined downward; the agreements that will hopefully be reached in Paris, while welcome, will likely not achieve the goal of keeping average global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Curbing global warming is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, and so far humanity has shown little adaptability or foresight. Human inertia will continue challenging Mother Nature, without apparent concern for the fact that nature always wins. To be fair, some progress is being made. According to a recent report by the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, by the end of 2014 renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro power constituted nearly 28 percent of global power-generating capacity, and prevailing trends point to an acceleration in this reliance on renewables (though the recent drop in oil prices has simultaneously inhibited the development of more expensive clean-energy sources). More dramatically, atomic fusion, after a long period of research and false starts, seems on the verge of major breakthroughs that could lead to commercial power plants becoming available by 2050, providing practically inexhaustible sources of clean energy. Stewart Prager , the head of the Princeton Plasma Physics laboratory, calls this development \u201cinevitable.\u201d In addition, governments and private institutions and individuals are starting to provide strong financial incentives for the development of cleaner sources of energy in the quickest possible manner. In a recent interview with The Atlantic, Bill Gates spoke urgently about two essential components of this effort. One is a carbon tax, which he describes as the \u201cpull\u201d that would create lucrative enticements to invest in clean alternatives to fossil fuels. The other is research and development, which he calls the \u201cpush\u201d that could generate a more efficient, permanent solution to global warming. (Before that permanent solution is found, humans will spend roughly $70 billion per year on adapting to the changed climate they have wrought\u2014costs that will only rise if action against climate change is further delayed.) Progress in curtailing CO2 emissions will come about not by human nature triumphing over Mother Nature, but through our collective realization that the survival of our species depends on how effectively we keep human nature in check\u2014and heed Mother Nature\u2019s warnings.","headline":"The Struggle of Our Time: Human Nature vs. Mother Nature","article_name":415599.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/11\/climate-change-carbon-paris\/415599\/","date_published":"2015-11-12 17:24:50","article_length":7736,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:04.353652","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/11\/climate-change-carbon-paris\/415599\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The South China Morning Post is arguably the world\u2019s most important newspaper\u2014for what it tells us about media freedoms as China\u2019s power grows. O n the night of August 31, 2019 , police officers rushed into a Hong Kong subway station, swinging their batons and chasing suspected anti-government protesters into the narrow carriageways of a parked train as an emergency warning blared overhead. Like many pivotal moments of the city\u2019s protest movement, the scenes were captured in photographs and live-streams by journalists and bystanders. The most enduring image from the incident shows a small group of people huddled by the subway door. Among them is a man crouching on the floor, holding his hand up toward the police in anguish and fear as he is doused by a thick stream of pepper spray. Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement was nearly three months old by then, and the police action marked a significant turning point. Reporters across the city tried to make sense of what they were seeing, and to properly explain the enormity of the moment: A subway station, once considered a safe space for commuters, had been breached ; and the police, who just months earlier had been seen as trusted members of the community, had assaulted civilians despite no clear evidence of a major security threat. At the South China Morning Post , Hong Kong\u2019s largest English-language newspaper, the now-familiar breaking news scramble that would last until early the next morning was under way. How the paper handled that story has since become a source of tension among its journalists, sparking a controversy that is emblematic, many of them told me, of the broader conflicts over media freedoms in the territory as it faces an uncertain future. When I asked the paper\u2019s executive editor about the episode, and more general questions about its protest coverage, he voraciously defended the outlet. Critics, he said, had tried to intimidate and bully SCMP journalists to \u201ccondition\u201d the newspaper's narrative to their own liking. \u201cShould we bend to this kind of pressure?\u201d he asked. The SCMP is not as well read as the international outlets that it would like to compete with, but because of its unique position\u2014as the main English-language outlet in a strategically important city\u2014its coverage plays an outsize role in shaping international understanding of events not just in Hong Kong but across the border in China, as well. An early draft of an initial story about the incident, according to a version that was read to me, had an opening that detailed \u201cchaotic and shocking scenes\u201d as officers went after \u201ccowering commuters.\u201d That was not the account that was eventually published, though. The SCMP \u2019s edited story (which was subsequently updated) instead recounted how \u201celite Hong Kong police\u201d had chased \u201cradical protesters\u201d wearing \u201cmasks\u201d into the subway station. The incident at the paper, recounted by two people with knowledge of the event, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution, exemplified the type of heavy-handed, slanted editing that became common in the SCMP newsroom as the demonstrations carried on. Journalists who spent hours, sometimes in a haze of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, saw their work drastically altered by editors before running in print and online. The police were typically portrayed as heroes, and the protesters as villains, with little explanation or context of each side\u2019s motives and grievances. \u201cThat was frustrating,\u201d one current reporter involved in coverage of the demonstrations told me. (This journalist, like others I spoke to, did not want to be identified, fearing a backlash from the SCMP .) With these stories appearing on the front page of the paper, the reporter said, \u201cthey\u2019ve given an impression that SCMP is anti protesters. As journalists, we should never be pro or against protesters.\u201d H ong Kong has a long legacy of an aggressive and boisterous media, in both the dominant Cantonese language and English. Newspapers are widely read, and they often carry sharp critiques of government and police failures. Those freedoms have been a hallmark of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that has set the city apart from mainland China, where journalism is heavily censored and far less free. Yet even before the recent enactment of a far-reaching national-security law in Hong Kong, the city\u2019s media were under strain. Numerous mainstream outlets have been bought by China-backed figures or pro-establishment businesses , shrinking the diversity of voices. In recent years, vigilantes have carried out attacks against senior editors and Beijing has harassed officials from Cantonese newspapers. And since protests began last summer, the government in Hong Kong has also sought to curb journalists\u2019 freedoms. Dissatisfied with honest accounts of official malfeasance, the authorities have sought to stifle some of the city\u2019s most cutting voices. Radio Television Hong Kong, the government-funded broadcaster that operates akin to the BBC, drew an official rebuke when a reporter pressed a World Health Organization adviser over the contentious issue of Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the global body and after its long-running satirical program took aim at the Hong Kong police. That program, Headliner , has since been suspended. Top newsroom executives have stepped down, and the broadcaster is now under government review . Police continue to harass journalists reporting on protests , which have shrunk dramatically in size and frequency due to a combination of the pandemic, new police tactics, and the national security law. Read: The leader who killed her city The new law has worsened the climate further. Reporters and editors in Hong Kong have been left wondering what journalistic activity may now constitute a crime, and they have received few assurances from the city\u2019s leaders. A number of local newspaper columnists have resigned from their positions, fearing that they may fall afoul of the national-security law. This month, The New York Times announced that it would move a portion of its staff to South Korea, a decision that is likely to be followed by other foreign outlets; at least three major Western news organizations, including the Times and The Wall Street Journal , are facing delays in securing new visas or visa renewals for their staff, according to people familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThe purpose of the law is precisely to manufacture a climate of fear among all the governed here,\u201d Kwai-Chueng Lo, the head of the writing program at Hong Kong Baptist University who has researched Hong Kong\u2019s media, told me. The SCMP sits at the center of many of these tensions. Founded in 1903, when Hong Kong was a British colony, the newspaper has long been the broadsheet of the city\u2019s elites, \u201cthe paper to be gripped while riding the bus or to be seen on one\u2019s doorstep in the morning,\u201d the veteran journalist Yuen-ying Chan wrote in an academic article examining Hong Kong\u2019s English-language media. Even beyond China, the SCMP has stood apart, operating free from the onerous press restrictions enforced in other Asian countries such as Singapore. Today, it is arguably the city\u2019s most important title internationally, a position gained from a combination of both its size and its ownership (it is controlled by Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba Group , one of China\u2019s most successful tech companies). But last year\u2019s protests tested the paper, as the global media spotlight shifted to Hong Kong, and the SCMP \u2019s reporters found themselves butting up against senior editors who often appeared to be overly deferential to authorities and largely unquestioning of police narratives, even as evidence of misconduct mounted. Largely due to its association with Hong Kong\u2019s establishment, and that establishment\u2019s growing reliance on business dealings with mainland China, the SCMP has always been a more staid outlet than its Cantonese counterparts. Through the late 1980s and into the mid-2000s, the paper was owned by the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and then the Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok, and while SCMP veterans often speak of a bygone golden era in which the paper was more critical, there have in fact long  been  instances that gave rise to questions about its editorial stance and censorship. When Alibaba purchased the paper in 2015, the company brought an infusion of much-needed cash. The SCMP hired additional staff, moved into new offices (complete with an on-site pub), and expanded editorial offerings, including the tech-focused Abacus and Goldthread , a video-heavy vertical that reports on Chinese culture. The paper\u2014long a must-read for English-language China watchers, its coverage being far more credible than any mainland outlet\u2014expanded its ambitions, courting a global readership hungry for news from China by dropping its paywall and eventually beefing up its team of China-based reporters to around 50. In 2018, it announced a tie-up with Politico that Gary Liu, the SCMP \u2019s CEO, said in an internal email was a sign of the newspaper\u2019s \u201cgrowing credibility and authority.\u201d (The SCMP has approached The Atlantic about coproducing events in the U.S. and Hong Kong, according to a spokeswoman for The Atlantic , but the partnership has never materialized. In recent years, the SCMP has also spoken to The Washington Post , according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Post did not respond to request for comment.) Thanks to those factors, as well as drastically increased interest in China, where, of course, the coronavirus pandemic began, the SCMP has seen a sharp rise in readership. Though its daily print circulation is relatively limited, at just over 100,000, it averages more than 50 million monthly active users\u2014a tenfold increase over the past three years\u2014and nearly 200 million pageviews a month. Around a third of that audience is in the United States, Liu said in a podcast interview with Digiday . Yet despite the largesse of its ownership, SCMP remains at the whim of the media market: The newspaper is unprofitable, Liu said during a Recode podcast , and its reliance on advertising has \u201cset off alarm bells.\u201d Staff were recently forced to take unpaid leave for three weeks, and management pay was cut. The SCMP is hoping to open up other revenue streams and will soon reintroduce its paywall . Read: Hong Kong is a colony once more Over the course of its history, the SCMP has largely fought off English-language challengers, both in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region. Today, its position atop Hong Kong\u2019s English media scene is largely unrivaled, but its ambitious goals\u2014and its new ownership\u2014have brought greater scrutiny, which the paper does not always seem comfortable with. In particular, there are questions about whether the 117-year-old institution could someday resemble the propaganda outlets trumpeting the party line over the border in China. Liu, who joined the paper in 2017 from the tech company Digg, has consistently pushed back against these concerns. \u201cThere is an immediate assumption that because Alibaba is a Chinese company that they are going to meddle in editorial,\u201d he said in the Digiday podcast. \u201cThat has never been the case.\u201d Yet Liu has acknowledged how tenuous the paper\u2019s editorial independence is. \u201cIf the laws of this city and the judiciary that protects those laws change to the point where there is no longer press freedoms in this city, the South China Morning Post will change,\u201d he told Digiday . (The owners have spoken about how they think coverage should be driven: \u201cA lot of journalists working with these Western media organisations may not agree with the system of governance in China, and that taints their view of coverage,\u201d Joe Tsai, chairman of the SCMP \u2019s board of directors and Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, said shortly after the sale was completed . \u201cWe see things differently, we believe things should be presented as they are.\u201d) Concerns have been raised over the newspaper\u2019s ethics, and its willingness to cooperate with Beijing since the sale. In 2018, the SCMP faced backlash when it conducted a government-arranged interview of Gui Minhai\u2014a Hong Kong bookseller and Swedish citizen who disappeared in 2015 and then reappeared in Chinese custody a year later\u2014in a detention facility while guards loomed over him . Liu has stood behind the interview and article, arguing that the SCMP agreed to the interview after discussions with editors, that there were no strings attached, and that the newspaper made a point of highlighting that Gui was accompanied by security personnel. But Angela Gui, the bookseller\u2019s daughter, told me she was unhappy with the paper\u2019s decision and its continued defense of the interview, which she says Beijing orchestrated to advance its own misleading narrative about her father\u2019s situation. \u201cMy father was, after years of illegal detention and torture, subjected to public humiliation by the Chinese government, and the SCMP was complicit by disseminating and legitimizing it as a \u2018news story,\u2019\u201d she said. W hen it comes to China , the SCMP \u2019s overall coverage remains far from Communist Party mouthpieces such as China Daily or Global Times . Indeed, its website\u2014like that of The Atlantic and other major Western publications, including the Times , the Journal , and others\u2014is blocked on mainland China. More illustrative has been its coverage of the Hong Kong protests, which proved to be an unexpected test for the paper. Liu told Recode that the newspaper strove to remove emotion from the reporting and editing of stories on the crisis. Those views were welcome on the opinion pages, Liu said, but not in the news section. \u201cThat separation for us is sacrament.\u201d However, nine current and former SCMP employees told me that the lines were often far less clear. Nearly all pointed to Yonden Lhatoo, the SCMP \u2019s chief news editor\u2014and among those responsible for editing the subway story\u2014as an example. Lhatoo, a former TV journalist who was described by current and former colleagues as an abrasive and mercurial presence prone to angry outbursts and frequent shouting, is part of a trio of senior editors seen as contributing to a sometimes caustic newsroom environment. Lhatoo also writes a regular opinion column and news stories as well. His editing of various articles that recapped days of protest grated on some journalists, particularly those reporting from the street. The tone was not missed by close readers of the newspaper. \u201cThere are choices of language and vocabulary that are in themselves a reflection of bias,\u201d said Louisa Lim, a former Beijing correspondent for NPR who is now a senior lecturer at the Center for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne, pointing to the use of terms like riot and rampage that often made it into the final versions of stories recounting protests. Members of the newsroom were particularly unhappy with a story Lhatoo wrote in October that ran in the news section of the paper, pushing a theory popular among pro-Beijing figures that there was a \u201csilent majority\u201d in Hong Kong that was against the protests but had been scared into silence. They were concerned enough to request a meeting with senior editors after the story\u2019s publication to discuss their concerns over Lhatoo and editing more broadly. Chow Chung Yan, the executive editor, and Zuraidah Ibrahim, the deputy executive editor, met with disgruntled staff, but \u201cthere was no attempt to try and reconcile anybody,\u201d one person present at the meeting told me. \u201cIt was just, \u2018This is the situation; if you don\u2019t like it, there is the door.\u2019\u201d Over the course of the protests and in the months that followed, a number of journalists central to coverage did leave the newspaper, and at least one other editor is expected to depart shortly, according to people familiar with the matter. More recently, Lhatoo, in a May 16 column, urged Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, to take a page from Donald Trump\u2019s book and strike back at \u201cmalicious journalists\u201d by labeling them \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d One former reporter likened it to \u201casking for an attack on press freedom itself.\u201d Read: The end of Hong Kong Liu did not respond to a message seeking comment. The paper\u2019s spokesman, Elgen Kua, sent a statement in response to a list of questions this month and suggested a visit to the outlet\u2019s newsroom once Hong Kong is past its latest wave of COVID-19 cases . In a follow-up call, Kua said, despite not having seen the comments themselves, that remarks made by current and former SCMP employees to me were \u201cquite libelous\u201d and that Lhatoo had become the target of a \u201chate campaign,\u201d something Lhatoo has addressed in his column . Shortly before this story was due to publish, and weeks after multiple interview requests were submitted, the SCMP made Chow available for an interview. Chow told me he believed The Atlantic was biased against the SCMP and in a combative interview, which lasted nearly 40 minutes, challenged the sourcing of this story, the timeline of when The Atlantic contacted the SCMP for comment, and defended the paper\u2019s protest coverage as well as its editorial standards and newsroom culture. \u201cI think actually, from the beginning, you already set your mind about the story angle,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom your line of questioning I have this worry that I don\u2019t think the SCMP will get fair coverage and I also think some of your story is maybe based on incomplete information.\u201d \u201cWe occupy the middle ground; that means some people are bound to feel like their views are not the dominant views and they feel resentful for that,\u201d he said of the paper\u2019s position. When asked about the Gui story, Chow compared the editorial decision to ones news organizations make when they are invited on government-organized tours of Xinjiang, where China has carried out a brutal crackdown. Regarding the story recapping the subway incident, he said the article was updated numerous times to reflect the chaotic situation on the ground and the end result was a balanced recount of the events of the day. Concerns over bias in favor of the authorities, particularly the Hong Kong Police Force, exist in the newsroom: In one case, a reporter who has landed numerous scoops for the newspaper on police actions, and has conducted a series of high-profile interviews, was ousted from a group chat with other journalists over concerns that she was possibly leaking information to the force, according to people familiar with the matter. (It was unclear if this ever occurred.) In another case, a story in June marking the anniversary of the protest movement featured a police officer who was injured by demonstrators when he was covered with unknown chemicals . The piece was similar to a report that ran in a recent issue of OffBeat , the police force\u2019s official magazine, featuring the same officer. Another article was an interview with a British police officer serving in Hong Kong that some in the newsroom felt gave him a free pass for police actions during the protests and played down his role in a property scandal unearthed by another outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s not critical at all,\u201d one current reporter told me of the interview. (Chow said that while he believed Hong Kong\u2019s police had room for improvement, they had become demonized by the public and the voice of the force was often missing from media coverage of the protests. \u201cIf you draw the comparison between the Hong Kong police and the police in the U.S. and U.K. and any other part of the world,\u201d he said \u201cI would say they are not particularly bad.\u201d Chow added that The Atlantic was \u201cin a sense joining the bullying gang,\u201d by singling out the SCMP \u2019s police coverage because of the difficulties faced by reporters who wrote positively about the force.) On the opinion side, the SCMP has withdrawn five stories purportedly written by Lin Nguyen , a fictitious personality who was part of a network of fake journalists exposed by the Daily Beast that published opinion pieces in various publications around the globe. The retractions came days after Alex Lo, a columnist based in Canada, unequivocally declared that the \u201cUS has been exposed for funding last year\u2019s Hong Kong protests,\u201d in a piece that was based on a Time magazine report and offered scant evidence to back up the claim, a popular narrative pushed by Beijing and Lam\u2019s administration . Chow said the paper had committed a \u201cslip of judgment,\u201d when it came to the Nguyen stories, and emphasized that Lo\u2019s piece ran in the opinion section, adding that the paper could not verify if\u00a0 \u201c Time magazine\u2019s story is true or not.\u201d Kua said in his statement that the SCMP reviewed and strengthened its verification process for submissions in response to the Daily Beast revelations. Still, concerns abound. As restrictions grow on international media in Hong Kong and across China, and smaller news organizations in the city are put under greater scrutiny\u2014the founder of Hong Kong Free Press , an English-language outlet, argued in The Guardian that the confusion set out by the national-security law was \u201ca feature, not a bug,\u201d and was designed to push journalists to \u201cself-censor\u201d\u2014the SCMP \u2019s importance when it comes to coverage of the country will only grow. How it manages the balance between these new, blurry, red lines and Hong Kong\u2019s history of a free and open press will matter far beyond the territory\u2019s borders. Liu, Chow, other senior editors, and some journalists have bristled at criticism of the newspaper, lamenting that its ownership makes it an unfair target. Following a 2018 story in the Times that was critical of the SCMP , Liu sent an email to staff, reviewed by The Atlantic , in which he said the article \u201cdisappoints me, it does not surprise me,\u201d and that it \u201cmisrepresents our mission and mischaracterizes our transformation.\u201d (No corrections or clarifications have been made to the Times story.) At the end of his interview with The Atlantic , Chow offered a vague warning about writing critically about the newspaper. \u201cThe last thing I want to say is I hope your story can be factual. If it is not, if it is anyway defamatory to SCMP and our colleagues, we will defend ourselves,\u201d he said. Asked how he would do this, Chow responded, \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you, Tim. But I can tell you we will defend ourselves.\u201d","headline":"A Newsroom at the Edge of Autocracy","article_name":614719.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2020\/08\/scmp-hong-kong-china-media\/614719\/","date_published":"2020-08-01 10:00:00","article_length":22382,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:04.532658","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2020\/08\/scmp-hong-kong-china-media\/614719\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Alas, a brief cold spell does not undo decades of scientific fact. It\u2019s something of an annual tradition for the president. On Sunday morning, as the eastern half of the country endured driving snow and frigid winter winds, Donald Trump asked on Twitter how climate change could be real if it was so cold outside. \u201cBe careful and try staying in your house,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn\u2019t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!\u201d Trump has raised similar concerns about that \u201cgood old fashioned Global Warming\u201d nearly every year since 2012. If it snows near Manhattan, the president says he isn\u2019t sure about climate change. Read: Trump, climate change, and the future of U.S. democracy Unfortunately, even as New York has occasionally been blasted with frozen precipitation, the world has kept warming. The past four years have been the four warmest years on record\u2014a fact that NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were due to announce this past week, were the government not shut down. Earlier this winter, Washington, D.C., experienced a shocking 22 days of above-average temperatures , and the Northeast as a whole saw a balmy January. President Trump did not seize that opportunity to affirm that global warming was real. The simple, tedious fact is that two things can be true at the same time: The world\u2019s average temperature can be clearly and dangerously increasing, and it can still snow sometimes in the northeastern United States. Climate emerges from averages, and the averages are unambiguous. Snowpack and ice cover are decreasing , especially in the Mountain West. The Great Lakes\u2019 winter-ice cover has declined by 71 percent over the past 40 years. The average time between the last frost of spring and the first frost of fall has increased in every region of the country since the early-20th century. None of these facts is likely to convince Trump, for Trump seems to have decided that he does not want to be convinced. As I wrote last year , he has expressed no interest or curiosity in updating his beliefs to reflect new facts. Instead, he has fought to keep those facts from the public: In November, every U.S. scientific agency affirmed the fact of human-driven climate change. The White House responded by trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday . \u201cOne of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we\u2019re not necessarily such believers,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post  while rejecting his own government\u2019s dire climate conclusions last year . Believers is an unfortunate choice of word because facts, alas, keep being true whether you believe in them or not. It is dangerously icy in the Northeast, and by all means local residents should stay inside. But a brief cold spell does not undo decades of scientific fact.","headline":"There\u2019s Snow on TV, so Trump\u2019s Tweeting About Climate Change","article_name":580885.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change\/580885\/","date_published":"2019-01-20 19:56:32","article_length":2992,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:05.254362","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change\/580885\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Here are seven ways of understanding the IPCC\u2019s newest climate warning. 1. There is no shortage of scary facts in the major new report on climate change and land, a summary of which was released today by a United Nations\u2013led scientific panel. Chief among them: For everyone who lives on land, the planet\u2019s dangerously warmed future is already here. Earth\u2019s land has already warmed more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the industrial revolution, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That\u2019s the same amount of warming that climate activists are hoping to prevent on a global scale . This spike makes sense, scientifically: Land warms twice as fast as the planet overall. Earth as a whole has warmed by only 0.87 degrees Celsius (1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) during the same period. But this increase makes the stakes of climate change clear: When scientists discuss preventing \u201c1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming,\u201d they are really talking about forestalling 3 degrees Celsius\u2014or 5.1 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014of higher land temperatures. And land temperatures are what humanity usually cares about. Land, really, is what humanity cares about. That\u2019s the point. 2. If the report has an overarching theme, it\u2019s that land is extremely scarce, we need it for everything, and we are already using most of it. More than 70 percent of the planet\u2019s ice-free land is already shaped by human activity, the report says. As trees are felled and farms take their place, this human-managed land emits about a quarter of global greenhouse-gas pollution every year, including 13 percent of carbon dioxide and 44 percent of the super-warming but short-lived pollutant methane. But unlike other sources of pollution\u2014such as the burning of fossil fuels, which must be quickly reduced globally\u2014land can\u2019t just be shut down. It must be made into a tool in the climate fight. The report\u2019s more than 100 authors, hailing from 51 countries, say that this will require immediate action from farmers, bankers, conservationists, and policy makers worldwide. And to really succeed, it will require hundreds of millions of affluent people in the Northern Hemisphere to change their diet, eating many more plants and much less meat\u2014and especially much less red meat\u2014than they do now. These changes must happen fast, because land problems have a pesky way of metastasizing. Louis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and an author of the new report, described the cascading consequences of warmer air temperatures at a press conference this week. \u201cAs the biosphere gets warmer, we increase evaporation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we increase evaporation, ecosystems dry out and burn when they normally wouldn\u2019t do that. And when soils get dry due to increased evaporation, we get longer heat waves.\u201d And longer heat waves, of course, make the biosphere warmer still, starting the cycle again. Around much of the world, this cascade has already begun. Heat waves worldwide have gotten longer, hotter, and more common, according to the IPCC. Deserts are expanding toward the poles, while zones of colder weather are shrinking. Dust storms are kicking up more often. And evidence suggests that every year from 1961 to 2013, an additional 1 percent of the world\u2019s drylands slipped into drought. As I said, there are a lot of scary facts here. 3. Yet one fact\u2014maybe the most important idea in the report\u2014didn\u2019t frighten me so much as leave me awestruck. It comes early in the document: \u201cPeople currently use one quarter to one third of land\u2019s potential net primary production for food, feed, fiber, timber and energy.\u201d It\u2019s a lot of jargon. But here\u2019s what it means. Recall from high-school biology that primary production is the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Besides the tiny creatures that live in deep-sea heat vents and other extreme environments, all life on Earth derives its energy from the sun. You and I don\u2019t get our energy directly from photosynthesis, but we eat plants\u2014or things that ate plants\u2014that do. Every major food chain on Earth begins with a plant, somewhere, humbly transfiguring photons into sugar. This is the net primary production that the IPCC alludes to. It\u2019s saying that the human demand for food, meat, clothes, and warmth now consumes at least 25 percent of the net product of photosynthesis on land. The free-wheeling, far-reaching maw of our material metabolism\u2014that thing we normally call the global economy\u2014devours as many as one out of every three sugar molecules made by dirt-bound plants, on net. Plants are one of the few things in the universe that can work this magic, as far as we know. And we have roughly hooked one out of every four of them into our planetary system of consumption and speculative exchange. Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what\u2019s happening now This isn\u2019t scary, necessarily, but it is strange. Whatever that kind of arrangement is, it doesn\u2019t seem constrained by economics or agriculture or ecology. And this is the most daunting aspect of the new report. For the scientific community, this document is a milestone because it assumes that land is scarce and precious. Climate researchers, for decades, have sometimes talked about land as if it is a limitless global sponge capable of cleaning the worst mess in human history. A recent high-profile study, for instance, cheerfully suggested soaking up most of the planet\u2019s carbon pollution by planting 1.2 trillion trees across 2.2 billion acres worldwide. It was impressive research, but it was immediately sold to the public as The Solution to Climate Change . And there\u2019s a problem with that. Those 2.2 billion acres\u2014an area roughly the size of the continental United States\u2014 are already in use . They comprise, in large part, the planet\u2019s most productive farmland! And in the decades to come, that farmland is going to be very useful if we hope to feed the 9.8 billion people who will soon reside on the planet. 4. In some ways, this is the most unavoidably political document that the IPCC has ever published. Its report last year, on the dangers of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, called for an unprecedented transformation in the globe\u2019s energy system. It demanded a rapid switch to carbon-free energy systems. But talking about the energy system is, in this context, relatively easy. No one\u2019s ever gone to war over electric cars or renewable portfolio standards. But land is different. It is home, and the possibility of home. The relationship between people and land is the most treasured and unresolved idea in global politics. As the IPCC says, land \u201cprovides the principal basis for human livelihoods and well-being, including the supply of food, freshwater and multiple other ecosystem services, as well as biodiversity.\u201d Another authority put it like this : \u201cCursed is the ground for thy sake \u2026 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.\u201d Chemically speaking, of course, we are mostly water. But everything we love about ourselves is solid, and therefore made of land. Accordingly, everyone has opinions about it. Somewhat notoriously in climate circles, the final summary of every IPCC report is written by the world\u2019s worst committee process. Over a marathon five days, the lead scientific authors sit at the front of a room and painstakingly read every line of the document to every national delegation that cares to attend. At any time, any delegation can more or less raise any issue with any word, and before the report can be published, every country\u2019s delegation must acquiesce to it in full. Historically, oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia use this process to raise one concern after another, bogging down the proceedings and effectively excising the strongest language from the final document. But the process this time, which took place in Geneva, unfolded differently. The world\u2019s developing countries might normally raise a few issues with the IPCC\u2019s initial proposed language. For this report, they asked for changes to line after line, according to Doreen Stabinsky , an environmental-politics professor at the College of the Atlantic who observed the talks. \u201cA lot of countries want to make sure that they see themselves, and their specific interests and issues, in every single paragraph,\u201d she told me this week. \u201cLand is something that\u2019s so local. People come with the land and food-security issues in their country. You can tell people in the room care really deeply about these questions, but it has made things incredibly slow. There\u2019s also some really complex political issues at the center.\u201d The biggest of these issues: Land can\u2019t really multitask. 5. Nearly every American knows what our peculiar national grid of farm and field looks like. During a drive across the Midwest, it rolls past, flipbook-like: field-field-road, field-field-road. During a coast-to-coast flight, it unfurls outside the plane window like a vast Cartesian quilt, lines meeting lines at right angles, circles of irrigation locked within squares. This grid system, formally known as the Public Land Survey System, covers much of the land outside the 13 original colonies. What every American may not realize is that this grid gives us a great advantage when thinking about area. Each of those grid squares is about one square mile. The Earth\u2019s total land surface is about 52 million square miles. So we only get 52 million grid squares to work with as a species. While 52 million squares may seem like quite a lot, consider that each of them is worth incommensurately more than $1. At some point in the past, $52 million might have seemed like quite a lot of money. But now it cannot buy a 10-foot sculpture of an orange balloon dog . These 52 million grid squares cannot only service our needs. They are all the land, period . They must also hold the vast, lovely, unknowable thing that we call nature\u2014every shady spot, every mountain stream, every sand dune. (The IPCC authors call this, somewhat dryly, \u201cbiodiversity and ecosystem services.\u201d) Every grain of rice and cobalt mine, every sidewalk square and platypus, has to be somewhere on that 52 million. Read: California\u2019s wildfires are 500 percent larger due to climate change These were the \u201creally complex political issues\u201d at the center of the IPCC talks. \u201cLand can\u2019t, at the same time, feed people, and grow trees to be burned for bioenergy, and store carbon,\u201d Stabinsky said. \u201cThat conflict of what\u2019s going to take priority as we face greater and greater climate challenges\u201d defined the talks, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more desire to try to use land to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, and that\u2019s going to interfere with food production.\u201d In a way, this process previewed the more consequential negotiations\u2014and, God forbid, conflict\u2014to come. And the report tries to anticipate some of these. The authors conclude that some land must be used to remove carbon from the atmosphere through a process called BECCS, or bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration. BECCS involves growing vegetation, burning it for energy, capturing the exhaust before it reaches the atmosphere, and burying both the exhaust and the charcoal underground. But very little land should be used for this, the report says. Otherwise it will start to induce food shortages in poor countries. 6. Even if the authors mumble about the future, they can clearly denounce the present crisis: That system of 52 million is already badly damaged. The planet\u2019s land absorbs carbon pollution today only because of a great \u201cnatural subsidy,\u201d said Louis Verchot, the report co-author. The 70 percent of ice-free land surface managed by people actually produces five gigatons of greenhouse gases a year. The remaining land surface\u2014the 30 percent in nature\u2019s control\u2014sucks up 11 gigatons. So while the land surface absorbs about six gigatons of carbon on net, this has nothing to do with people. \u201cThe land is out of balance in areas that we are managing,\u201d Verchot said. \u201cThe biosphere is offsetting the carbon emissions, but that\u2019s not a reason to call the land in balance.\u201d He called this absorption an \u201cadditional gift of nature,\u201d but it may be more apt to call it the final gift of nature. And at some point in the coming century\u2014as more forests are felled and as demand for beef grows\u2014this gift could become a curse, and the land will spew greenhouse gases into the air as ferociously as humanity does today. Even before that reversal, this report confirms that the ill effects of climate change will arrive faster than scientists once thought. Under 1.5 degrees Celsius of planetary warming, Earth will face a high risk of food shortages, mass thirst, and rampant wildfires. Remember that land warms faster than the planet: A 1.5-degree-Celsius-warmer world would in fact be 3 degrees Celsius, or 5.1 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter on land. Cynthia Rosenzweig , a senior research scientist at NASA and an author of the report, warned this week of \u201cmultiple bread-basket failure,\u201d in which crops die across several major agricultural regions at the same time. She noted that crops in Europe had already suffered this summer under successive heat waves. Farmers in the midwestern United States, meanwhile, have been hammered by spring and early-summer floods. Avoiding 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming is a very aspirational if. While it\u2019s not too late to stop our current course, humanity must put in extraordinary effort to hold warming to such a manageable level. If every car, pipeline, and power plant around today were allowed to keep operating until it broke down, and no other new fossil-fuel infrastructure was built, they would still lock in enough carbon emissions to shoot Earth well past 1.5 degrees of warming, according to a recent study . At the same time, climate policy may do more than we realize. Timothy Searchinger , a land scientist at Princeton who was not involved in the new report, told me that the IPCC may undercount the benefits of land policy specifically. The panel does not always assume that farmers, for instance, will get better at capturing carbon if paid to do so, even though technology almost always improves in such circumstances, he said. Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis But on our current trajectory\u2014and on any trajectory, frankly, where the United States does not adopt a serious climate policy\u2014it\u2019s far more likely that the planet will warm at least 3 degrees Celsius (5.1 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. That means that average land temperatures will be 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than they are today. The IPCC warns that people who live on such a planet will face a \u201cvery high risk\u201d of famine, water scarcity, and mass vegetation die-offs. Some of the people who will see that planet have already been born. 7. Let\u2019s return to that one astonishing fact: that humans have integrated as much as one-third of photosynthesis on land into the global economy. This statistic captures not only the rice or broccoli or carrots on your plate, but the coffee in your mug, the cotton fiber in your socks, the oak heartwood in your kitchen table, and the linseed oil in your linoleum floor. What\u2019s incredible about this fact is not only the scale of economic production that it entails. It\u2019s that photosynthesis isn\u2019t even the energetic part of the economy. What we call \u201cthe energy sector\u201d still mostly consists of fossil fuels: oil, coal, and natural gas. Those three fuels generated 80 percent of the energy used in the United States in 2017, at least by a traditional accounting. Of course, fossil fuels are themselves just concentrated sunlight: The Permian oil basin in Texas is so named because it holds the gloopy product of photosynthesis made during the Permian period , more than 251 million years ago. And there\u2019s a view of climate change as a massive spending spree, the end result of humanity spending down its 600-million-year inheritance. But that\u2019s not my point. To address climate change, we will need to reduce our use of fossil fuels, and replace energy generated in the past (by long-dead plants) with energy generated today (by wind turbines, solar panels, and uranium atoms). But, this report adds: We must do all that in a house of only 52 million rooms, the majority of which already serve as someone\u2019s bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen. And those 52 million rooms must stage not only the unending drama of the human family, but also\u2014as far as we know\u2014every other living thing in the universe. How are you even supposed to talk about that? More than 30 years after climate change first became a political issue, it feels like we are still figuring it out. This report gets us closer. It makes clear that climate change isn\u2019t only about coal-fired power plants, or gas-guzzling cars; and it\u2019s definitely not about littering or\u2014God help us\u2014recycling . It\u2019s about the profound chemical and physical specificity of human life. You and I are not free-floating minds that move around the world through text messages, apologetic emails, and bank deposits. We are carbon-based creatures so pathetic that we need a lot of silent plants to make carbon for us. Climate change requires us to alter the biogeochemical organism that we call the global economy on the fly, in our lifetimes. Such a task should command most of the time and attention of every economist, agriculturalist, investor, executive, and politician\u2014anyone who fancies themselves a leader in the physical workings of the economy, or whatever we call it. It is our shame, and theirs, that they don\u2019t.","headline":"This Land Is the Only Land There Is","article_name":595705.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/how-think-about-dire-new-ipcc-climate-report\/595705\/","date_published":"2019-08-08 19:57:07","article_length":17673,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:05.736683","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/how-think-about-dire-new-ipcc-climate-report\/595705\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new U.N. report, integrating the findings of more than 800 climate scientists, says there's still a chance to reverse climate change. A new report from the United Nation's panel of climate scientists offers little in the way of surprises: Climate change, it says, is almost entirely man-made; it will be irreversible if nothing is done soon; and reducing greenhouse gases to zero this century may be necessary to reverse its effects. This isn't surprising. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's final volume, dubbed the \" Synthesis Report ,\" echoes the previous three reports that relied on the findings of more than 800 scientists released over the previous 13 months. \"Science has spoken,\" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the launch of the report in Copenhagen . \"There is no ambiguity in their message. Leaders must act. Time is not on our side.\" The report makes it clear that scientists are more certain than ever before that human activity is responsible for climate change. \"Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history,\" the report says. To keep the the global temperature rise from reaching what the panel views as a dangerous level, emissions from fossil fuels may need to drop to zero by the end of the century. The report cites increasingly frequent and severe heat waves, melting glaciers, and dramatically changing sea levels as indicators of the accelerating rate of climate change. Although the report by and large has a bleak outlook, it also strikes a hopeful tone, saying that educating the general public about climate change is the key to reversal. \"We have the means to limit climate change,\" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri says in a press release issued with the report. \"All we need is the will to change, which we trust will be motivated by knowledge and an understanding of the science of climate change.\" We already have technology, the report points out, that could play a major role in helping to end our dependence on fossil fuels. \"It is technically feasible to transition to a low-carbon economy,\" Youba Sokona, co-chair of one of the IPCC's working groups, says . \"But what is lacking are appropriate policies and institutions. The longer we wait to take action, the more it will cost to adapt and mitigate climate change.\" Secretary of State John Kerry called the report \"another canary in the coal mine\" and warned that politics and ideology should not get in the way of taking action. \"The bottom line is that our planet is warming due to human actions, the damage is already visible, and the challenge requires ambitious, decisive, and immediate action,\" Kerry said in a statement . \"Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids.\"","headline":"'All We Need Is the Will to Change'","article_name":382262.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/11\/pessimistic-un-climate-change-report-also-offers-an-out\/382262\/","date_published":"2014-11-02 16:09:05","article_length":2885,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:06.082239","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/11\/pessimistic-un-climate-change-report-also-offers-an-out\/382262\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A Senate hearing Thursday on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline produced a clear piece of news: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce isn't especially fond of talking about humans' contribution to global warming. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez asked the Chamber's Karen Harbert whether the Chamber agrees that climate change is real and caused by humans. \"The Chamber has a long record on climate and here is what it is: Number one, we support addressing our environment [with] things that work,\" said Harbert, who heads the Chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy, in response. She then noted that U.S. carbon emissions have been falling already and said Europe's cap-and-trade program isn't working. \"We want to be in favor of things that work, technologies that work, that put Americans back to work, so we strongly believe in improving the environment while also protecting the economy,\" said Harbert, who later in the hearing would note the Chamber's support for green-technology R&D and energy-efficiency legislation. But Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, kept pressing on his specific climate query. \"That's not responsive to my question,\" Menendez said. \"I asked a very simple question: Does the Chamber believe that climate change is real and caused by humans? Yes or no?\" Harbert replied: \"We believe that we should be doing everything in our power to address the environment.\" Menendez replied: \"That's great. But is climate change caused ... is it real?\" {{ BIZOBJ (video: 4812) }} Harbert: \"The climate is warming, without a doubt.\" Menendez: \"So climate change is real. Is it caused by humans?\" Harbert: \"And the other part of that answer is, is it warming as much as some of my colleagues on this panel have predicted in the past, and the answer is no.\" (The witness panel included former NASA climate scientist James Hansen and Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.) Menendez: \"I am going to get to that, too ... but you have got to give me your answer: Is it caused by humans?\" Harbert: \"It is caused by lots of different things, and you can't say that climate change is only caused by humans. I think the science is what you're pointing to, and we have a robust debate going on in this country, as we should, and those that would say everything is settled sort of undercut the integrity of science. It's an ongoing discussion.\" So, at the end of all that, the Chamber is acknowledging a human contribution to climate change. But Harbert's framing underplays the extent of agreement among scientists that human activities, including carbon emissions from fossil fuels, are the key driver of global warming. For instance, a recent joint report by the National Academy of Sciences and the U.K.'s Royal Society concludes that recent climate change is \"largely\" caused by humans, and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year concluded there's at least a 95 percent chance that humans have been the \"dominant\" cause of warming since the mid-20th\u00a0century. The Menendez-Harbert exchange on climate begins at the 59:50 mark here .","headline":"Here Is Exactly What the Chamber of Commerce Thinks About Global Warming","article_name":447177.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/03\/here-is-exactly-what-the-chamber-of-commerce-thinks-about-global-warming\/447177\/","date_published":"2014-03-13 19:20:45","article_length":3099,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:06.649759","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/03\/here-is-exactly-what-the-chamber-of-commerce-thinks-about-global-warming\/447177\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Legalizing marijuana is extremely popular. So why won\u2019t Joe Biden embrace the idea? Democratic political consultants dream of issues like marijuana legalization. Democrats are overwhelmingly in favor of it, polls show. So are independents. A majority of Republicans favor it now too. It motivates progressives, young people, and Black Americans to vote. Put it on the ballot, and it\u2019s proved a sure way to boost turnout for supportive politicians. It\u2019s popular in key presidential-election states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Florida, Arizona, and Virginia. There\u2019s no clear political downside\u2014although marijuana legalization motivates its supporters, it doesn\u2019t motivate its opponents. For the Democratic presidential nominee, the upsides of supporting it would include energizing a very committed group of single-issue voters and making a major move toward criminal-justice reform and the Bernie Sanders agenda. Joe Biden won\u2019t inhale. Democrats eager for Biden to support legalization have theories about why he won\u2019t. His aides insist they\u2019re all wrong. It\u2019s not, they say, because he\u2019s from a generation scared by Reefer Madness . It\u2019s not, they say, because he spent a career in Washington pushing for mandatory minimum sentencing and other changes to drug laws. It\u2019s definitely not, according to people who have discussed the policy with him, because he\u2019s a teetotaler whose father battled alcoholism and whose son has fought addiction, and who\u2019s had gateway-drug anxieties drilled into him. With legalization seeming such an obvious political win, all that\u2019s stopping Biden, current and former aides say, is public health. He\u2019s read the studies, or at least, summaries of the studies (campaign aides pointed me to this one ). He wants to see more. He\u2019s looking for something definitive to assure him that legalizing won\u2019t lead to serious mental or physical problems, in teens or adults. America appears to be moving on without him, and so are the future leaders of his party. If Biden really has his eyes on public health, he should think about how many Black people end up in jail for marijuana sale and possession, argues Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Chokwe Lumumba\u2014a young Black progressive who oversaw local decriminalization in his city in 2018. Biden should also think about how an illicit, unregulated market is leading to the drug being laced with other chemicals, and the health effects of that, Lumumba told me. If Biden thinks marijuana is addictive, he said, then he should explain what makes it worse than alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Legalization is a necessary part of criminal-justice reform, Lumumba said. \u201cI would encourage him and his campaign more broadly to do more research on some of the finer points,\u201d he added. Alternatively, John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, says Biden should think about how legalization could raise tax revenue in the post-pandemic economy of state budget deficits. \u201cWhat better time than now to have that conversation?\u201d Fetterman told me. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Fetterman spent a year traveling his state, including areas that mostly voted for Trump in 2016, proselytizing \u201ccommonsense\u201d legalization. There\u2019s even more reason to agree with him now, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate policy and financial low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not moved by the gross racial disparities, what state doesn\u2019t need a couple hundred million more in revenue at this point?\u201d Read: America\u2019s invisible pot addicts Amid the criticism that Biden hasn\u2019t taken a definitive stance on legalization, it\u2019s easy to lose track of how far ahead he is of any other major-party presidential nominee in history in terms of changing marijuana policy. He\u2019d decriminalize use, which would mean fines instead of jail time, and move to expunge records for using. He\u2019d remove federal enforcement in states that have legalized the drug. That\u2019s further, by far, than Donald Trump, or Barack Obama, has gone. Biden would move marijuana off as a Schedule 1 narcotic, the same category as heroin, but would not take it off the illegal-drugs schedule entirely, so that federal law would treat it the way it does alcohol or nicotine. John Morgan, a Florida Biden donor and a major proponent of legalization in his state, is a proud user of marijuana, and told me he knows many Democrats and Republicans who are too. He\u2019s been able to get Ron DeSantis, his state\u2019s Republican governor and a big Trump ally, on board with legalization. Morgan said that when he broached the issue briefly with Biden last year ahead of hosting a fundraiser for him, the candidate responded, \u201c\u2018I know where you are on this.\u2019 I just took it to be as You know where I am on this .\u201d Erik Altieri, the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a pro-legalization lobbying group, told me that although his organization heard from several of the other leading Democratic presidential campaigns last year, it never got a call from the Biden team. Biden\u2019s resistance is particularly frustrating for those who remember how he was a pioneer in standing up for legalizing same-sex marriage, the biggest recent issue on which laws suddenly flipped to catch up to changing views. Maybe, one person who\u2019s spoken with Biden theorized, the difference is that he knew gay people, but believes\u2014almost certainly falsely\u2014that he doesn\u2019t know people who regularly use marijuana. That\u2019s a bad guess too, Biden aides told me. \u201cAs science ends up with more conclusive evidence regarding the impact of marijuana, I think he would look at that data. But he\u2019s being asked to make a decision right now. This is where the science guides him,\u201d Stef Feldman, Biden\u2019s policy director, explained to me. \u201cWhen he looked to put down his position on marijuana in writing for the purposes of the campaign, he asked for an update on where science was today. He didn\u2019t ask for an update on what views and science said 20 years ago. He wanted to know what was the best information we know now. And that is what he made his decision on.\u201d Read: What Americans don\u2019t know about Joe Biden This can seem both perfectly reasonable and a ridiculous excuse. There isn\u2019t some conclusive study about health effects that Biden is ignoring, but one is also not likely to emerge anytime soon. And though they insist this is all about health, other ripples from legalization are on the minds of institutionalists like Biden and his close advisers: trade deals that require both sides to keep marijuana illegal would have to be rewritten, half a century of American pressure on other countries about their drug policies would be reversed, and hard-line police unions would have to be convinced that he wasn\u2019t just giving in to stoners. Realistically, marijuana isn\u2019t a priority right now for the campaign. Legalization is at once too small an issue for Biden\u2019s tiny team to focus on and too large an issue to take a stand on without fuller vetting. And it comes with a frustration among people close to Biden, who point out that liberals talk about trusting science on everything from climate change to wearing masks\u2014and, notably, wanted vaping restricted because the health effects were unclear\u2014but are willing to let that standard slide here because they want marijuana to be legal. Biden\u2019s compromise: going right to the edge of legalization, while appointing a criminal-justice task force for his campaign whose members have each supported at least some approach to legalization. But that sort of signaling doesn\u2019t get people to the polls. \u201cBeing cute is fine. Being bold is motivating,\u201d Ben Wessel, the director of NextGen America, a group focused on boosting political involvement among younger voters, told me. \u201cIf Biden said he wants to legalize marijuana tomorrow, it would help him get reluctant young voters off the fence and come home to vote for Biden\u2014especially Bernie [Sanders] supporters, especially young people of color who have been screwed by a criminal-justice system that treats them unfairly on marijuana issues,\u201d Wessel told me. Publicly supporting marijuana legalization would be an easy, attention-grabbing move, and might help many Sanders diehards get past the fact that he\u2019s not where they want him to be on the rest of their candidate\u2019s democratic-socialist agenda. Altieri, the pro-marijuana lobbyist, said coming up with a legalization policy wouldn\u2019t take much work: Sanders had one, as did Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andrew Yang. Or Biden could check in with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who wrote a legalization bill based on the argument that legalization is essential to the criminal-justice-reform conversation. Altieri is not impressed with how little Biden has moved so far. \u201cWhere he\u2019s at now would have been maybe a bold stance in 1988. It\u2019s not much of one in 2020,\u201d he told me. In 2018, top Democrats credited a legalization ballot initiative in Michigan with boosting turnout and producing the biggest blue wave in the country\u2014winning races for governor, Senate, attorney general, and secretary of state, along with flipping two congressional seats and multiple state-legislature seats. A ballot initiative is expected for the fall in Arizona, New Jersey, South Dakota, and possibly Montana. Anyone who believes\u2014hopefully, or out of cynical political calculation\u2014that Biden will announce some big change in his thinking, aides told me, will be disappointed. Just do it, Fetterman said: Do it, if only to secure Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes and get that much closer to the White House. \u201cIf Joe Biden\u2019s account tweeted out \u2018Legal. Weed.,\u2019 it would get a million likes in the first two hours. I guarantee it. And no one\u2019s going to accuse Uncle Joe of being a pothead,\u201d Fetterman told me. \u201cIf you think weed is the devil\u2019s tobacco, you ain\u2019t voting for Biden anyway.\u201d","headline":"The Marijuana Superweapon Biden Refuses to Use","article_name":613777.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/07\/biden-marijuana-pot-legalize\/613777\/","date_published":"2020-07-06 11:00:00","article_length":9865,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:06.834796","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/07\/biden-marijuana-pot-legalize\/613777\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"As the climate changes, hyperlocal projects are helping keep disadvantaged areas livable. \u201cGrandma, is the air on?\u201d Kisha Skipper was worried. She\u2019s the vice president of the Yonkers NAACP and a member of the Climate Safe Yonkers Task Force, a group that\u2019s planning projects to make the city safer in a hotter world. And she could see her 95-year-old grandmother sweating on the video call. Skipper\u2019s grandmother is reluctant to turn on her air-conditioning even on the hottest days, because running the unit costs money and she\u2019s on a fixed income. Every dollar is already spoken for. \u201cI am going to turn it on right now,\u201d she tells Skipper whenever she asks. But Skipper fears that her grandma\u2019s frugality will kill her. \u201cThe same way they say \u2018all politics is local,\u2019 all climate issues are local,\u201d Skipper says. \u201cOf course, we should be focusing on the global scale. But why does it have to be one or the other?\u201d The United States has recently taken noteworthy steps to address climate change at the global level. A new law dedicating roughly $374 billion to climate action and the quiet ratification of a treaty to reduce the consumption and production of climate-toasting hydrofluorocarbons suggest, to optimistic climate wonks, glimmerings of progress. But dangerous levels of warming are already here. One study estimates that more than a third of heat-related deaths over the past few decades might not have occurred without climate change. Sublethal suffering matters too: heat-related illness, flooded homes, children stuck inside on the hottest days. Forty-six percent of Americans say they have personally felt the impacts of climate change. And a growing body of research shows that poor neighborhoods\u2014especially Black and brown neighborhoods\u2014are hit the worst. To address these unequally distributed harms, a number of grassroots environmental organizations have begun working at the hyperlocal level, raising money and mobilizing volunteers in neighborhoods that are already inside the climate crisis. In Yonkers, maps showing which neighborhoods were once formally designated for Black families can be almost overlapped with maps of where the city is hottest. These are neighborhoods with few trees, block after block of concrete parking lots and shadeless streets soaking up the sun all day and radiating heat all night. The work of planting trees in neighborhoods like these, as well as installing rain gardens, removing pavement, and making sure that the elderly can afford air-conditioning, might seem like small potatoes compared with the high-powered policy making necessary to stop climate change on the global or national level. But unlike those top-down approaches, hyperlocal adaptation can proceed even if climate-change deniers are elected to national office or international negotiation grinds to a halt. James Fallows: A plan to grow 90,000 trees in Los Angeles Cate Mingoya-LaFortune, the national director of climate resilience and land use at Groundwork USA , says that top-down mitigation and local adaptation go hand in hand. Groundwork helps coordinate a network of local efforts, including Groundwork Hudson Valley, which runs the Yonkers Climate Safe Neighborhoods Task Force, where Skipper is contributing her understanding of her community\u2019s needs. In each community, local residents are asked what would make their neglected neighborhood more livable in a hotter world. Groundwork helps pay for the chosen projects with grants from charitable foundations and local governments. The goal, Mingoya-LaFortune says, is \u201cto push back against that urban history\u201d that has left certain neighborhoods covered in asphalt and baking hot. In Yonkers, Groundwork has contributed funds for water-retaining rain gardens and water-directing bioswales in municipal housing, designed to handle rain and prevent flooding during storms made more intense by climate change. The systems were built by local high-school students . Other sites in the network include neighborhoods in Milwaukee, Kansas City, San Diego, and other cities. In Elizabeth, New Jersey, it is raising funds to establish several \u201cMicroForests\u201d\u2014ultradense plantings of native species. In New Orleans, they are helping pay for solar-powered shaded benches where people can recharge their phone during emergencies, including in the aftermath of hurricanes. That\u2019s not to say that hyperlocal efforts can\u2019t benefit from national funding. The Biden administration\u2019s \u200b\u200b Justice40 Initiative , announced last year, is likely to direct more money to this kind of neighborhood-level adaptation. Mingoya-LaFortune says she expects that federal support will allow Groundwork to \u201csignificantly expand and advance our work.\u201d The initiative pledges to allocate 40 percent of certain federal funding in climate-related fields to \u201cdisadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.\u201d Even if neighborhood adaptation taps into federal funds or foundation money, the nonprofit leaders I interviewed say the efforts are always more successful when led or at least guided by locals. For example, lots of climate-adaptation projects center on planting trees for shade, but Skipper told me that Southwest Yonkers can\u2019t afford to wait for them to grow. She wants money for businesses downtown to install shade awnings so people without cars can safely do errands in the heat. She also wants reliably open cooling centers and legal support to help people behind on their electricity bills avoid shutoffs\u2014not necessarily projects that well-meaning outsiders would have prioritized. Those well-meaning outsiders, Skipper said, can help by advocating for climate justice with local elected officials, protesting, and organizing\u2014amplifying their neighbors\u2019 voices. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong; we will definitely still take your money as well,\u201d she said, laughing. Read: Earth\u2019s new gilded era In Portland, Oregon, people from across the city are helping out with the physical work of neighborhood climate adaptation. Depave is a nonprofit that does exactly what you think: demolishes and removes unused and unnecessary pavement, such as concrete schoolyards and empty parking lots, and replaces it with green spaces, which can store carbon, retain water, provide shade, and clean the air. \u201cI think the act of prying up asphalt in itself is radical,\u201d the director, Katya Reyna, told me. Reyna and her team cut the pavement with large motorized saws, and then local volunteers pry it up with crowbars. Later, the site is planted and\u2014crucially\u2014maintained over the long term through weeding and planting parties. Depave prioritizes public spaces that serve low-income, Black, and Indigenous communities. The organization and its volunteers have depaved at schools, tribal offices, Boys and Girls Clubs, and community centers. All told, they\u2019ve removed about 230,000 square feet of pavement since 2008. \u201cI firmly believe that actual lasting change does start from the community level,\u201d Reyna said.

But for people who live in neighborhoods already hit hard by global warming, hyperlocal action can yield real results. When hot, treeless, or flood-prone neighborhoods are greened and reengineered, residents can feel the difference on their skin. They can smell the trees. And these projects can save people like Skipper\u2019s grandmother from heatstroke. \u201cIf we change the life of one person at a time, then we\u2019re doing our part,\u201d Skipper said.","headline":"A Plan to Cool Off the Hottest Neighborhoods","article_name":671875.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/10\/hyperlocal-climate-change\/671875\/","date_published":"2022-10-26 20:01:13","article_length":7579,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:07.829371","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/10\/hyperlocal-climate-change\/671875\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Disastrous environmental events are converging like never before. Updated at 12:47 p.m. ET on September 8, 2021. A fter this summer\u2019s first searing heat wave baked the Pacific Northwest, the environmental scientist Robert Rohde posted an unusual observation on Twitter. Looking through a report that analyzed temperature patterns for the region over the past 70 years, he noted, \u201cthe heatwave was statistically \u2018impossible.\u2019\u201d Obviously, the heat wave wasn\u2019t literally impossible, given that, after all, it happened. But the broiling temperature that the Northwest reached\u2014108 degrees Fahrenheit at one point in Seattle, 121 degrees in British Columbia\u2014was so far beyond the observed experience, he explained, that it exceeded even statistical models\u2019 outmost potential extremes for the area. A few weeks later, I caught up with Rohde, the lead scientist for Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit research group that analyzes current and historical climate data, via Zoom from Zurich, where he\u2019s now living. He reiterated that the Northwest temperatures reached this summer were outside the boundaries \u201cof what we thought was possible.\u201d Rohde allowed that such seemingly impossible events do in fact \u201csometimes\u201d occur. But, he told me, it\u2019s much more common for extreme events to match a rare high point with at least some historic precedent\u2014hence the idea, say, of the thousand-year flood. Truly unprecedented events that shatter any previous experience, he said, have been much rarer. \u201cIt is not that common,\u201d he said drily, \u201cto find results that look impossible.\u201d Rohde offered two explanations for such a unique event. The heat wave, he suggested, might have represented a meteorological black swan: \u201ca rare dynamical interaction that has always been possible, but so rare that in 70 years of data we never observed a weather pattern that was qualitatively similar.\u201d But there was also, he said, a second, \u201cscarier\u201d explanation for the surge, which led to hundreds of excess deaths across Washington and Oregon , as well as mass die-offs for shellfish that were literally baked in their shells : The climate is changing in ways we don\u2019t entirely understand. \u201cOnce in a while, Mother Nature can throw surprises at us, and what we have experienced in the past is not always a good predictor of the future,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd climate models are telling us that some things that are coming are not necessarily what we are familiar with.\u201d Across the western United States, 2021 is the year when the unimaginable became the unavoidable. The severity of the threat has been matched only by its breadth. Record heat this summer has battered not just the Northwest, but also the Southwest (where California\u2019s Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, or 54.4 Celsius, possibly the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth ). Drought conditions have been reached this year in virtually every western state, including Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, an expanse of at least 1.1 million square miles. The heat and drought have contributed to record wildfires burning across Oregon, California, and other states. As of Monday, more than 1.6 million acres have burned in California alone, a similar number to the acres burned at this time last year. In 2020, a record 4.2 million acres burned.) The fires have produced apocalyptic orange skies and emitted harmful particulates to trigger air-quality emergencies. Power systems have teetered under increased demand from the heat and distribution outages caused by the fires (while also, as in previous years, sparking some of the fires ). Salmon and other fish species throughout the Pacific Coast states have suffered enormous losses because of declining water levels and rising water temperatures. The juniper tree is facing systemic decline in Arizona and Utah , and because of the extreme aridity, previously burned forests across the West appear to be regenerating more slowly. In mid-August, water levels in Lake Mead, the giant reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, fell so low that the Interior Department declared the first official water shortage in the lake\u2019s 85-year history and announced cuts in the promised water allocations to Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico. Leah C. Stokes: How can we plan for the future in California? This has been the West\u2019s summer of extremes. In every direction, the consequences of climate change across the region have become more tangible, immediate, inescapable. \u201cIt feels like the first inkling of an apocalyptic movie,\u201d Jay Inslee, the Washington governor and a longtime leader on climate issues, told me recently. \u201cPeople can usually deal with one [threat], maybe two, but this comes to you from every direction.\u201d H eat, drought, floods, and especially the lengthening and intensifying wildfire season, have compelled the West to reckon with climate change more explicitly than probably any other region in America. But this summer\u2019s convergence of extreme events proves that climate change isn\u2019t a future threat; it\u2019s here. Scientists, political leaders, and environmentalists all broadly recognize that extremes and unpleasant surprises\u2014events that once seemed impossible\u2014will become more commonplace. Even describing climate-related events as unprecedented or unpredictable becomes less meaningful: Is an event that has never happened before really \u201cunpredictable\u201d if such events are now happening virtually every year? Or is it more accurate to say that unpredictable and unprecedented events are now an eminently predictable, even reliable, element of the region\u2019s future? To borrow from the late Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s famous phrase about the Iraq War , the biggest lesson of this year\u2019s severe events may be that the West faces a climate future marked by the certainty of uncertainty, or \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d (Even more ominous is that climate scientists don\u2019t rule out the possibility that we\u2019ll experience Rumsfeld\u2019s concept of \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d: threats so novel that we can\u2019t even fully conceptualize them now. Rohde described these as \u201cevents that are not just pushing the boundaries a little bit, but are really jumping out at us as something we did not expect based on what we had prepared for in the past.\u201d) The known changes that have already hit the region are daunting enough. Patrick Gonzalez, a forest ecologist and climate scientist at UC Berkeley who also advises the National Park Service on climate, recently summarized them for me. \u201cGreenhouse-gas pollution from cars, power plants, deforestation \u2026 have increased temperature as much as 2 degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, in the Southwest U.S.,\u201d he told me. Combined with a period of lower precipitation (a natural cycle that so far scientists have not definitively linked to the changing climate), that excess heat, he said, has \u201ccaused a drought across the Southwest since 2000 that has been the most severe since the 1500s.\u201d Fueled in turn by the heat and drought, forest fires are now annually burning twice as much acreage as the \u201cnatural\u201d level recorded through history. In the Mojave Desert alone\u2014which includes Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, as well as the Mojave National Preserve\u2014\u201cincreased aridity has caused four out of 10 bird species to disappear locally since the early 1900s,\u201d he said. To Gonzalez, this pattern of threats is following pretty closely what the climate models warned. But many others I spoke with this summer believe that change is consistently hitting the West at the very high end of what the models considered possible or sometimes beyond it. Mary Nichols, who served as the head of the California Air Resources Board in the 1970s and again from 2007 through last year as the state developed its pathbreaking agenda to reduce carbon emissions, says that although the direction of change isn\u2019t surprising, the pace of it is. \u201cI think the multiple assaults on the system from various directions are absolutely consistent with what the models were predicting,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just happening faster than the scientists had been suspecting\u201d\u2014or at least, in their desire to appear cautious, were willing to publicly forecast. Even if scientists had warned of the extreme heat, fire, and drought events the West has experienced this year, \u201cI don\u2019t know [that] they would have been believed,\u201c she said. Inslee likewise thinks that he\u2019s dealing with climate effects that push at, or through, the outer boundary of forecasts. \u201cMost days, I am reading something about some scientific data points coming in that are outside the projected range: hotter, drier, faster, whatever,\u201d he said. He expects climate change in the coming years to present the same kind of unanticipated challenges as COVID-19 is doing now\u2014with the coronavirus\u2019s Delta variant powering a massive new outbreak only weeks after the U.S. appeared to be on track to finally contain the pandemic. Like a global pandemic, climate \u201cis a very complex system, and the bad news is it seems like we can\u2019t catch a break: Everything that could go bad in climate is going bad in climate. It\u2019s hard to find a good data point.\u201d John F. Ross: How the West was lost In one sense, experts told me, the convergence of dangerous effects this summer can be seen as coincidental. There will be years that are wetter or drier, hotter or cooler, more prone to fires or less. But, as Rohde said, this year\u2019s simultaneous extremes are \u201cnot random,\u201d either. \u201cThere are very direct interactions between extremes in heat, extremes in precipitation, and extremes in fire, and so a lot of these extreme events are interacting in such a way that they will tend to pile on top of each other,\u201d he told me. Moreover, as carbon continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, years that simultaneously produce record levels of heat, drought, and fire will become more frequent. \u201cNot every year will be an extreme year; there will be normal years along the way,\u201d Rohde told me, expressing a view echoed by other scientists. \u201cBut we will have an increasing frequency of these extreme years, so there will be times when it just stands out like, Oh my God, what is happening? \u201d To Vijay Limaye, a climate and health scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, the most unnerving aspect of the mounting impacts across the West are the feedback loops. \u201cWe are seeing really scary signals in recent weeks about the intersecting effects,\u201d he told me. To take one: Long-term, chronic drought means that less of the heat from the sun is consumed to evaporate water from the soil, which \u201ccompounds the temperature\u201d rise in the atmosphere. \u201cThen you suddenly expand the possibility of devastating wildfires, and so you have this cascading series of effects.\u201d Katharine Jacobs, the director of the University of Arizona\u2019s Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions and an expert in water systems, points to the next consequence in the chain. \u201cWhen it is hotter and it is drier, obviously you have a much higher chance of wildfire, so the watersheds that are upstream from reservoirs may wind up burning,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat leads to sediment flows that both reduce the volume of reservoir capacity and increase sediment in the water supply and in some cases actually mean you have to shut down the system. And at the same time, those wildfires are causing air-quality problems that are interfering with virtually everyone who is engaging in outdoor activity.\u201d These complex dynamics test the ability of any institution to plan for what\u2019s coming. The governments that obtain water from the Colorado River have painstakingly negotiated the supply cutbacks that the federal government announced this month (first affecting Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico, but potentially reaching California before long). Some experts worry that future water flows will be even lower than the official projections, forcing another round of difficult talks for further reductions. States across the region are also facing the limits of adaptation in confronting fire risk. Local governments are putting more money and effort into maintaining their forests to clear away the dead trees and plants that provide fuel for the wildfires (a cause that former President Donald Trump highlighted as part of his effort to downplay the consequences of climate change). But \u201cyou can\u2019t manage your forests out of the problem,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cWe are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into managing our forest, but that cannot solve this problem when everything is tinder-dry and one spark means a cataclysm.\u201d W hether the absolute  magnitude of climate change in the West is more severe than in any other U.S. region is an open question: Some of the experts I talked with said yes, while others said that the heat waves and hurricanes in the Southeast or the heat waves and floods in the Midwest may be at least as damaging. But even so, there\u2019s a general sense among local leaders and scientists that the West remains the U.S. region where life as we know it today will face the greatest disruptions from climate change. The reason is that the West starts with little margin for error. Because it is so arid, development in the West has always been precarious. Since the 19th century, its growth has relied on a sustained triumph over nature, massive engineering projects funded primarily by the federal government to tame its rivers to produce the water and electric power that made possible its growing cities\u2014Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix (the latter two are the second- and fifth-largest cities in the country). \u201cThe modern West is a human construct, dependent on a massive rearrangement of water availability across large areas,\u201d Daniel Farber, of the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at Berkeley Law, wrote recently . \u201cThe physical and legal infrastructure of the West is geared toward a certain climate regime. At great expense and effort, dams, canals, and irrigation systems have been carefully engineered for a climate that no longer exists.\u201d The experts I spoke with differed on which of the climate-induced changes under way may reshape life in the West the most. Nichols, of the California Air Resources Board, picked the rising atmospheric temperatures. \u201cI think, realistically, it\u2019s the periodic heat waves that just kill people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tend not to pay as much attention to them; we don\u2019t assume there is a right to air-conditioning in most places, but at a certain point, you are going to see large numbers of excess deaths,\u201d along with threats to outdoor work and recreation that will affect \u201cevery aspect of how people can live.\u201d Read: \u2018What is this doing to their lungs?\u2019 Inslee worries most about the particulates and other air pollutants released in fire seasons that are now both longer and more destructive. \u201cThe respiratory issues \u2026 are the most, in some sense, immediate because our kids can\u2019t go outside because of the particulate pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too unhealthy. We tend to like to breathe, and finding a solution to that is the most challenging. Staying inside right now is the only one, but that is pretty limiting.\u201d Katharine Jacobs pointed to a problem that isn\u2019t necessarily the most threatening but may prove the most intractable and tragic: the impact of climate change on plants and animals. Although humans can adapt to hotter temperatures by shifting work patterns or adding air conditioners in areas such as the Northwest where they are rare, animal and plant life can\u2019t adapt as quickly or easily. \u201cI am absolutely petrified about the implications for biodiversity and for quality of life, recreation, forest health, all of those things, because you cannot innovate your way into protecting all of that, whereas people have lots of options if they are willing to make adaptive choices,\u201d she said. Mass die-offs of salmon and other freshwater fish in multiple states from rising water temperatures and declining water levels, and the reports of at least 1 billion shellfish (and probably more) boiling in their shells during the Northwest heat wave, underline her point. But without discounting any of these dangers, most of the experts I spoke with pointed to drought and reduced water supplies as the biggest long-term threat from climate change to the West. Climate change is putting pressure on western water supplies from almost every direction. Because the air is hotter, it draws more moisture from plants; parched soil in turn absorbs more water before allowing runoff to rivers. Snowpack in the mountains, which operates as an essential source of natural storage for the water system, accumulates less (because more precipitation is falling as rain) and then also melts more (because of rising temperatures). One study estimated that each Celsius degree of warming would reduce the water flow in the Colorado River, the principal water source for most of the West, by nearly 10 percent. Even heavier precipitation, the scientists concluded, \u201cwill not suffice to fully counter\u201d the robust drying driven by the changing climate. When it comes to water supplies, \u201cevery year in the West is a roll of the dice,\u201d Felicia Marcus, the former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, told me. \u201cBut with climate change, the dice are loaded.\u201d The squeeze on water supplies from the changing climate isn\u2019t a surprise; scientists have been tracking it for years (which is why states across the region have been compelled to negotiate cutbacks in their allocations from the Colorado River). But, as on many fronts, the shortfalls are developing at the far end of the most pessimistic projections, if not past them. Even people who \u201chave been looking at water-supply issues for several decades and anticipating climate change \u2026 have been surprised by how quickly the impacts have escalated,\u201d said Jacobs, who has studied water policy for decades as both an Arizona state official and a senior climate adviser in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. \u201cThe physics of this pretty much were known a long time ago, but as a water manager, I have to say I don\u2019t know of any water managers who understood the dramatic relationship between increase in heat of a few degrees and a reduction in flow of surface water. It goes beyond what seems to be predictable, just thinking about it from a physical perspective.\u201d The western states, as a group, have actually performed quite well over the past generation in conserving water: Through pricing incentives and mandatory installation of water-saving technologies, California now uses less water than it did in 1980, though its population is far greater. Phoenix and Tucson likewise use no more water than they did in 1985 despite huge population growth, Jacobs said. Marcus, now a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Water in the West program, said that climate-driven constraints will require further significant tightening. California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s request in July that Californians voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 15 percent is likely only the beginning. The good news, Marcus said, is that there are many opportunities for savings. \u201cUrban areas can adapt because we are so wasteful now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe use over 50 percent of our water on outdoor ornamental landscaping, which is mostly keeping a lawn as green as a Scottish golf course \u2026 You could get rid of the lawns and plant more trees.\u201d More recycling and recapture of rain runoff (the L.A. area is expanding its water-recycling efforts through two massive projects that are each larger than any now operating in the world, as well as a huge stormwater-capture program funded under a fee measure passed in 2018 ) can also offset the continuing squeeze on water supplies. Agriculture across the West, Marcus said, will also need to live with \u201cbigger limitations\u201d on its water supplies and learn to grow more with less. On the other side of the water challenge\u2014managing rising sea levels and more dangerous floods\u2014San Francisco has been leading the way with a bond initiative that provides hundreds of millions of dollars to nurture wetlands and tidal marshes that can serve as a natural buffer against floods and capture carbon as well. \u201cWe have to integrate the natural world into our thinking,\u201d Marcus said. Through measures like the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area initiatives, Marcus believes, the West can reconfigure its water system to cope with the reduced supply, even as its population continues to rise. But the pace of change must rapidly increase. And none of it will be painless. Reduced supply to agriculture will affect consumers because California produces such a large share of the country\u2019s fruits and vegetables. (California, for instance, is the source of all of the nation\u2019s commercially grown almonds, a highly water-intensive crop , and less water could mean lower production and higher prices at a time when demand is soaring, partly because almond milk has proved a hit with so many consumers.) And, after restrictions imposed during the last drought expired in 2017, both local and statewide California officials have not shown much appetite for confronting homeowners with limits on water usage for maintaining lawns or hosing down driveways (though the pressure of the new shortfalls could soon change that). Water law will need to adjust as well, Farber said, because the current rules prioritize agriculture and even with conservation, population growth will demand a shift of limited water resources from farms to cities. \u201cWe are going to have a lot of political conflict over what to do with an increasingly scarce resource,\u201d he said. Read: The most important number for the West\u2019s hideous fire season In the end, Marcus believes, adapting to the drier future will be a task comparable in magnitude and difficulty to the original test of building the enormous network of dams and water systems that made the West\u2019s settlement possible in the first place. \u201cIt really is going to be the test of our civilization,\u201d she said, \u201cas to whether we can retrofit ourselves to live within our means with the vision and audacity of that original expansion.\u201d T he disruptive climate-change events unfolding now reflect the impact of carbon that was released into the atmosphere years ago. As Nichols noted, the carbon already emitted guarantees that the extreme events happening across the West this year will become more common, and even more severe, \u201cno matter what\u201d we do to reduce emissions going forward. The main question is whether we can slow the rate of emissions to a point that holds those future changes in the climate to a range the West can plausibly adapt to. The West, as I noted, may be threatened by the changes already baked into the climate more than any other U.S. region, because its aridity means it starts with so little margin for error. It also faces the pressure of growing demands on its natural resources from a steadily rising population: All but one of the 12 counties that added the most people from 2010 through 2020 (including those centered on Phoenix, Seattle, Las Vegas, Houston, and Dallas) are located from Texas to the Pacific Coast. Should the most environmentally stressed region add people that quickly? Generally, the experts I spoke with said that although adjustment won\u2019t be easy, with sufficient planning and adaptation (things like more water conservation, more air conditioners in the Northwest, more concentrated development to limit expansion into fire-prone areas), the region should be capable of sustaining a continually growing population, albeit not without heavy burdens, such as more punishing heat waves or smoky days that force the residents of big cities to huddle indoors. But even that conditional optimism rests on a profoundly uncertain foundation. All of the scientists and government officials I spoke with agreed that any hope of adaptation depends on rapidly reducing, and eventually eliminating, the addition of more carbon into the atmosphere. If emissions are not controlled, our adaptations will continually be running behind further deterioration in the climate beyond what planners anticipated. \u201cUltimately, to have our adaptation responses be manageable, we have to stay committed to very ambitious emission reductions, because if we do not reduce emissions, the effects are going to be that much worse,\u201d says Nuin-Tara Key, the deputy director for climate resilience at the California Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Research. Gonzalez, of UC Berkeley, likewise said that if emissions are controlled, the West can likely adapt to the changes already locked into the system, but if the world fails to hold the global temperature increase below the international goal of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, the future effects will be extremely difficult to contain\u2014like wildfires at five times the historical average. On the ground, the future already seems ominously unstable to the activists and officials I spoke with this summer in Sebastopol, a hippie-flavored, now-gentrifying small town in the Russian River Valley northeast of San Francisco. On the western edge of Sonoma County\u2019s wine country, the town is thriving with Bay Area transplants seeking more affordable housing; it\u2019s developed a stylish shopping and eating complex downtown, in a former apple cannery called the Barlow. On the day I was there, families descended with lawn chairs for free afternoon concerts on stages set up in between the craft breweries, wine bars, and boutiques. Read: The West can end the water wars now In the past few years, the Russian River Valley has experienced almost every danger climate change can offer: flood, drought, wildfires. The fires haven\u2019t yet broken through to downtown Sebastopol, but hardly anyone in the area feels immune after the most intense blaze, in 2017, burned through affluent residential neighborhoods nearby. Then in 2019, severe flooding from the Russian River submerged much of the region, including the Barlow. Fires raged again in 2020. Now drought has left the Russian River (the central attraction for the region\u2019s tourism industry) at a low ebb and forced cutbacks in water supplies. Water shortages have added a new challenge for the area\u2019s many wineries, which already saw nearly one-third of their grapes last year ruined by smoke from the persistent wildfires. (Smoke can leave the grapes tasting, in the evocative if unappetizing analogy many wine growers use, like a wet ashtray.) Kari Svanstrom, Sebastopol\u2019s planning director, told me that she and her counterparts across Sonoma County are all being forced to wrestle with the likelihood that these extreme events will hit more often. \u201cWe are looking at increased frequency as well as new impacts that weren\u2019t necessarily planned for in the past,\u201d she said. Sonoma County, perhaps not surprisingly as an upscale Democratic-leaning place, takes climate change very seriously. The county already generates 97 percent of its power from carbon-free sources, and the county commission earlier this year endorsed the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030\u2014fully two decades ahead of President Joe Biden\u2019s national goal. Kenna Lee, a home hospice nurse, is participating in all these efforts as the chair of the citizens\u2019 climate advisory committee that Sebastopol\u2019s city council established earlier this year. With its relatively affluent population, she says, the city should become a model for strategies to cut carbon emissions, through ideas such as building community storage facilities for solar energy and constructing renewably powered \u201cresilience centers\u201d that can serve as cooling spaces during heat waves or evacuation points during fires. \u201cThis is a wealthy place that should be an incubator for ideas,\u201d she told me when we met in the Barlow. After 20 years living in the area, she\u2019s excited about those possibilities, yet she says that if not for her family situation, she would have moved away already because of the accumulating threats from flood and especially fire. The fires have become so persistent that her company has been forced to develop evacuation plans for all its patients; Lee was worried enough about her own fire risk that she recently moved from her house about two miles outside of town to a new home inside Sebastopol close to the fire department. Lee is determined to do everything possible to control the risks of a changing climate, through both adaptation and reducing future emissions, but she\u2019s also keenly aware that even if she achieves all the goals she\u2019s working toward, she cannot prevent the risk from increasing. In that way, she personifies the equation facing the West in a warming world. \u201cWe tell ourselves\u201d that it is safe to keep living as we have been, Lee told me, \u201cbut looking at it from any rational perspective, no one can believe that. We tell ourselves that because, otherwise, we can\u2019t go on living our lives.\u201d This article previously misstated that 2018 held the record for most acres burned in California.

{"id":null,"body":"The more 90-degree days a fetus or infant endured, the lower his or her earnings in adulthood. Even if countries take moderate action on climate change, by the end of this century , Phoenix is expected to have an extra month of days above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while Washington, D.C., is expected to have another three weeks of these sweltering days, as the Climate Impact Lab and New York Times reported. A new study suggests that even days that are an average of 90 degrees Fahrenheit, or 32 Celsius, might have long-term, negative impacts on developing fetuses. The stress of the hot weather might show up as reduced human capital once those fetuses reach adulthood. Maya Rossin-Slater, a health-policy professor at Stanford University, said she and her team wanted to understand the long-term consequences of climate change on people. For the study , published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , she and other researchers looked at data on births, weather, and earnings in half the states in the United States. For a given county, on a given day, they measured how many days above 90 degrees a child born that day would have experienced during gestation and during their first year of life. They then compared that person\u2019s salary as an adult to someone born in that same county on that same day in other years. It turned out fetuses and infants exposed to a single extra 90-plus degree day made $30 less a year, on average, or $430 less over the course of their entire lifetimes. Right now, the average American only experiences one such day a year. (This study looked at the average temperature throughout the entire day, not the highest temperature that day.) By the end of the century, there will be about 43 such days a year. In addition to birthday and county, the researchers also controlled for gender and race. Rossin-Slater said it is unlikely the difference in earnings could be explained by something other than heat. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to figure out what else it could be. They set up a really good study design,\u201d said Kathryn Grace, a professor of geography, environment, and society at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the study. What\u2019s more, the study used data from the 1970s, when more and more people were installing air conditioners in their houses. The researchers found the difference in earnings went away in areas where most people got air conditioners installed. It\u2019s not entirely clear how hot temperatures would be causing this dip in earnings. Fetuses and infants are especially sensitive to heat because they don\u2019t yet have the ability to self-regulate their body temperatures. Rossin-Slater said there are three potential pathways by which being too hot could impact the fetus: The heat could overstress it, which could affect the child\u2019s health. Heat could also affect how nutrients are delivered to the fetus, or harm its cognitive development, and thus potentially things like focus or self-control. Nathaniel DeNicola, an obstetrician with George Washington University and an expert on environmental health, said it\u2019s well established that extreme temperatures can affect fetuses, for example by restructuring proteins that are involved in organ formation, and extreme heat raises the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Those issues, in turn, can sometimes cause cognitive impairment. Still, he said, the authors could be missing some other variables that could be contributing to adult salaries, and it\u2019s not clear that adult salaries are a marker of good health. The overall message from the study, to him, should be that \u201cthere are clear health risks to extreme heat, and those risks are worse during the critical periods of development.\u201d (In the study, there was no effect on earnings for children older than 12 months either way.) Women shouldn\u2019t get too worried if they are pregnant and living in a warm area, Rossin-Slater cautioned. The difference in earnings was small, after all, and nothing happened to the air-conditioned babies. But that also doesn\u2019t mean we should look to AC to solve all our climate-change woes. Air conditioning isn\u2019t free, and people in the developing world\u2014which is hotter\u2014are more likely not to have access to it. \u201cIn poor countries, we can sometimes be like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s food insecurity, it\u2019s drought, it\u2019s not temperature,\u2019\u201d Grace said. \u201cThis is a place for us to start thinking about what physical environments do to our health.\u201d","headline":"Climate Change Might Lower Salaries","article_name":547406.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/hot-weather-fetuses\/547406\/","date_published":"2017-12-04 20:00:00","article_length":4461,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:08.562671","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/hot-weather-fetuses\/547406\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"According to the UN, most major polluters are not on track to meet their Paris goals. But critics say that accounting may be too pessimistic. Humanity is losing ground in its battle against climate change. On Tuesday, a new UN report warned that the world is farther than it was last year from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. More than half of the planet\u2019s richest countries\u2014including Canada, Australia, South Korea, the United States, and the nations of the European Union\u2014are not cutting their carbon pollution as fast as they promised under that treaty, it says. If humanity does not change course, then Earth could warm by roughly 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, the report suggests. This is enough warming to set off some of the most feared consequences of climate change, including deadly heat waves , ravaging wildfires , widespread plant and animal extinctions , and potentially many feet of runaway sea-level rise . Read: The worst is yet to come for California\u2019s wildfires \u201cThe gap between where we are and where we need to be is much bigger than it was last year,\u201d says Philip Drost, an officer at UN Environment who helped write the report. \u201cWe have new evidence that countries are not doing enough.\u201d Joseph Curtin , a senior fellow at the Institute of International and European Affairs who was not involved with the UN report, affirmed its overall message. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise whatsoever that the picture has worsened since last year,\u201d he told me in an email. Meeting the Paris goals \u201crequires dramatic global reductions in emissions, but as the report notes, emissions have not declined.\u201d But he took issue with some of its country-specific conclusions, especially for the EU. The report uses a stringent method of forecasting whether a country is on track to meet its goals, extrapolating only the policies that are in place today. He predicted that the EU would make its Paris targets by its 2030 deadline, adding that the group must reconcile policies across 28 member states. \u201cThe EU is in fact rushing ahead to meet its pledge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just snap your fingers and make it happen.\u201d The UN\u2019s dire diagnosis comes as the Paris Agreement faces an ambiguous future. Completed in 2015 , the treaty allowed for each country to set its own climate goal. The UN expects each country to increase the ambition of its climate goal over time. But President Donald Trump, who intends to withdraw the United States from the agreement , has damaged this \u201cratchet mechanism,\u201d Curtin said. Read: Did Donald Trump just make the planet hotter? In fact, a global rightward shift on climate change seems to be occurring. In the United States, Trump has undone several  major  programs meant to limit carbon pollution. In Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull failed to pass an energy-reform bill that included modest climate goals, and was promptly ousted by his own party for proposing it. In Brazil, the far-right president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to strip the Amazon rainforest of its legal protections , possibly clearing the way for logging of such scale as to virtually ensure dangerous climate change . Even in France, the birthplace of the climate treaty, rioters have taken to the streets this week to protest President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new climate-friendly tax on gasoline and diesel . France, Brazil, Australia, and the United States are all members of the G20 , an organization of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies or central banks. Drost, the UN officer who helped lead the new report, said the G20 countries are primarily responsible for the growing failure to meet Paris. Taken together, they emit about 80 percent of worldwide carbon pollution every year. But Drost did not solely blame laggards in the G20, such as Australia or the United States, for failing Paris. A few members of the group\u2014notably India, Russia, and Turkey\u2014will massively overshoot their Paris targets, he said. This suggests that they originally picked goals that were too easy to meet. The UN report identifies two reasons for the growing gap between the Paris goals and reality. First, worldwide carbon pollution rose in 2017 , thanks to growing economies in Asia, booming SUV sales worldwide, and a small increase in coal use in India . This was the first time that global carbon emissions had risen in three years. Second, a blockbuster report released last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world will not be able to directly remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as once thought. Read: What SUVs reveal about the erosion of American society \u201cA lot of people were patting themselves on the back for the flatlining in emissions from 2014 to 2016,\u201d says Kelly Levin , an author of the UN report and a policy analyst at the World Resources Institute. \u201cBut even if [countries\u2019 Paris goals] are fully implemented, emissions aren\u2019t scheduled to peak until after 2030.\u201d Under that set of goals, the world would warm above pre-industrial levels by at least 5.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100\u2014and likely more if it overshoots the 2030 targets. That\u2019s not nearly enough to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, according to that same recent IPCC report. To safely hold global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees, the IPCC says that the world must dramatically cut emissions before 2030 . Earth has already warmed 1.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century. But countries \u201chave a lot of time to course-correct,\u201d Levin told me. Most of them have set a self-imposed deadline of 2030 for their Paris goals, although a few, including the United States, chose 2025. Curtin said that he fully expected the EU to make its goals under the Paris treaty\u2014it just needed more time. \u201cThe EU is on track to meet its 2020 pledge (it will significantly over-comply), and then 2030 will come into greater focus,\u201d he told me. He added that he doesn\u2019t love the UN\u2019s pessimistic public pose. \u201cI think it\u2019s very dangerous to take a \u2018plague on all their houses approach,\u2019\u201d he said. Instead, he favored promoting policies such as those in Sweden, the U.K., and Germany as examples the rest of the world should follow. And not everything looks bleak in global climate policy. Even as the United Kingdom plans to leave the EU, it has publicly promised to uphold the EU\u2019s climate goals under Paris. The UN report also hails states, cities, and companies that have promised to cut their carbon emissions. The Science Based Targets initiative , which has set pollution-cutting goals for companies such as McDonald\u2019s, General Mills, and CVS Health, deserved high praise, Drost said. \u201cWhat this report makes strikingly clear is that everyone has to do everything,\u201d he told me. \u201cCitizens have to be engaged, have to pay attention, have to use their purchasing power, have to demand change from businesses. Governments have to scale up their [Paris pledges]. Everyone needs to act, and everyone can act.\u201d","headline":"It's Not Just America: Climate Policies Are Stumbling Worldwide","article_name":576700.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/how-hot-will-climate-change-make-earth\/576700\/","date_published":"2018-11-27 19:06:53","article_length":6981,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:09.676022","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/how-hot-will-climate-change-make-earth\/576700\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Yes, but it didn\u2019t act alone. Weather always makes good news, but the role of climate change in altering weather, especially extreme weather, has made the subject a lightning rod for unease. A case in point this week: A heat wave is triggering record temperatures in the Southwest. American Airlines reported having canceled up to 50 flights at Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor airport, where the temperature has neared 120 degrees in recent days. Flight cancellations are a perfect foundation for climate-change panic. Commercial air travel is an aspect of ordinary life that touches everyone: Travelers can\u2019t help but worry that their mobility will be impacted by near- and long-term effects of climate change. Much  of  the  coverage tracking the American Airlines cancellations pegs climate change as a direct or indirect cause of the disruption. That account isn\u2019t wrong. But it doesn\u2019t tell the full story, either. When I asked, American Airlines cited a 118 degree \u201cmaximum operating temperature\u201d for the flights in question, and confirmed that \u201cthe heat has impacted some of our regional flights.\u201d But airplanes don\u2019t exactly have such neat and tidy maximum temperatures. Temperature limits might affect avionic systems\u2014the electronics that run communication, navigation, and so forth\u2014but temperatures interact with airplane performance more than they allow or prohibit flight itself. Density altitude , which can change in part based on temperature, affects aerodynamic performance of specific aircraft, but that performance also interacts with other factors, including weight. \u201cAircraft engine performance is a function of many things including air temperature,\u201d Glenn Lightsey, an aerospace engineer and colleague of mine at Georgia Tech said. \u201cHotter days require longer runways and more gradual ascent paths to lift the same weight.\u201d Flight is complex, and it cannot be boiled down to a single number. The specific aircraft matters, too. American Airlines canceled flights using Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) equipment. These are the business jets that cover routes between hubs and smaller markets. Larger passenger jets are rated to tolerate higher temperatures, well above those currently being experienced in the American Southwest\u2014after all, planes also fly from Dubai, Riyadh, and Cairo. The CRJ\u2019s history might play a role in its airworthiness under extreme heat. CRJs are currently made by Bombardier, a multinational transportation manufacturer. Bombardier bought the CRJ line from Canadair, a Canadian state aerospace company. These jets were originally designed for business use, and only later developed to serve the commercial regional jet market. They were not necessarily intended for use in all conditions and markets, nor to be packed full of passengers like they are today. (Bombardier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) That circumstance is a consequence of deregulation and consolidation in the American airline market. When regulation demanded that airlines serve all markets, larger jets serviced smaller airports. But as those requirements lifted, and as more airlines merged, even once-thriving hubs like Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Memphis have become minor markets. Airlines began relying on equipment like the CRJ, because they can transport a smaller number of people at a lower cost. Were the affected flights on Boeing large jets instead, there would be no question about their ability to fly. Speaking of cost, it\u2019s not clear if American itself has issued the CRJ-based flight cancellations, or if they came from the regional partners that actually operate those flights under American-Airlines livery. The business relationships between major carriers and their regional partners are complex. Some are wholly owned subsidiaries, while others\u2014including Mesa and SkyWest, which serve Phoenix on behalf of American\u2014are contracted carriers. Regional carriers tend to endure financial pressures from their major-carrier partners, some of which might make the effects of high-temperature operation a financial or operational burden. For example, it\u2019s possible that the planes could fly safely above a certain ground temperature, but that the performance data to facilitate that flight is not already available or easily determined. Airlines have to buy the performance charts used to operate flights, and they might determine that it is not worth purchasing them for unlikely or uncommon scenarios. American Airlines didn\u2019t comment when I asked who had made the determination to cancel flights, or if available performance data had any impact on the decision. At least one other airline, Delta, also canceled a flight operated by SkyWest on CRJ metal scheduled at the peak of Tuesday\u2019s heat, although it isn\u2019t clear if temperature played a role in that decision, or which airline made the call to cancel it. Grounding flights due to heat in Phoenix clearly is a matter that interacts with climate change. But it\u2019s not solely explained by climate change. Industrial history, public policy, market economics, and other factors exert pressure on the situation, too. And that applies to more than flight. Climate change is a wicked problem because it interacts with so many other aspects of the lived and built environment. It does the subject a disservice to pretend that it can be summarized by the reading on a thermometer.","headline":"Did Climate Change Ground Flights in Phoenix?","article_name":530976.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/06\/did-climate-change-ground-flights-in-phoenix\/530976\/","date_published":"2017-06-20 19:06:00","article_length":5366,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:10.696707","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/06\/did-climate-change-ground-flights-in-phoenix\/530976\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s difficult to imagine the party nominating two white men for president and vice president ever again. In the final rally Joe Biden held before COVID-19 shut down the country in March, he clasped hands on a stage in Detroit with a group of emerging Democratic stars. \u201cI view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\u201d he declared a few minutes later. \u201cThere is an entire generation of leaders that you saw standing behind me. They are the future of this country.\u201d Yesterday, Biden took a major step toward redeeming those words when he chose Senator Kamala Harris of California, one of the Democrats on that stage, as his vice-presidential nominee. By selecting Harris, Biden has positioned the Democratic Party for a profound generational and demographic transition, and he\u2019s addressed the fundamental incongruity of his candidacy: the inherent strain of a nearly 78-year-old white man leading a political coalition that relies on big margins among young voters, people of color, and women. Biden represents the Democratic Party of his post\u2013World War II coming-of-age: a coalition centered on blue-collar white people who worked with their hands, mostly in smaller industrial cities such as Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he was born. From almost every angle, Harris embodies the Democratic Party of the 21st century: a biracial child of immigrants (who is herself in an interracial marriage) who rose to political prominence from a base in San Francisco, a diverse, globalized hub of the emerging information economy. Many obstacles still prevent women and people of color from achieving power in the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership commensurate with their influence in its voting base. But Harris makes the concept of Biden as a bridge more concrete\u2014and potentially more attractive to younger nonwhite voters displaying lagging enthusiasm for him\u2014by embodying the other side of that span: a party that potentially makes more room at the table for people who look like her. \u201cI think Kamala Harris has the potential to activate a voter that otherwise has not seen themself reflected in the Democratic Party,\u201d says Terrance Woodbury, an African-American Democratic consultant who studies younger voters. Read: Why Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris Many members of the Democrats\u2019 \u201ccoalition of transformation,\u201d including professional women, immigrants, and African Americans, can see aspects of their experience reflected in Harris\u2019s life. That could make her a resonant symbol of the Democrats\u2019 embrace of a changing America, and offer a rebuke\u2014not only in her words but through her sheer presence\u2014to a president who has openly wielded racist and sexist language. Yet the fact that she personifies the changing country so clearly will also make her a more tempting target than Biden for Trump and his allies, who are trying to convince the GOP\u2019s \u201ccoalition of restoration\u201d that a Democratic victory will threaten to erase the America they have known. Attacks from the right won\u2019t completely muffle complaints on the left. As Woodbury and other activists note, Harris will \u201chave some things to prove\u201d with younger racial-justice advocates skeptical of her record as the district attorney of San Francisco and as California\u2019s attorney general, particularly her reluctance to pursue prosecutions against law-enforcement officials involved in the killing of civilians. But no one I\u2019ve spoken with disputes the power of Biden acknowledging that Black voters\u2014especially Black women voters\u2014deserve representation at the very apex of the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership. Harris\u2019s new role is especially meaningful because of the possibility that Biden, if he wins, might not run for reelection in 2024, which would position her as a front-runner, if not the front-runner, for the Democratic nomination that year. When Biden made his announcement yesterday afternoon, I was on the phone with Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, which advocates for advancing more women of color in the Democratic Party. We were discussing her ambivalent feelings about how Biden\u2019s vice-presidential selection process had unfolded over the past few weeks. She considered the large number of Black women, and other women of color, considered for the position an overdue recognition of their pivotal role in the modern Democratic coalition. \u201cFor me, the VP discussion reflects a new way of thinking about and valuing the leadership of women of color,\u201d she told me. But she was frustrated and angered that several of the Black women candidates, particularly Harris, had faced what Allison saw as a hazing in the press from some older white male Democrats, including former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, who was part of the small committee Biden had assigned to assess his choices. \u201cWhat\u2019s very clear is we have political institutions and a political culture that has a very unique way of tearing down women who are standing for leadership, who have impressive experience [and] come with impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, with a capacity to inspire voters in a way white guys can\u2019t,\u201d Allison told me. \u201cThe conversation was very racist and very sexist. It\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a problem we have with Republicans. It\u2019s a problem with Democrats. It\u2019s bigger than a political party.\u201d Those words had barely left Allison\u2019s mouth when the news broke that Biden had selected Harris. For a moment, she was overcome with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable. I get emotional\u2014she\u2019s just made history,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. Harris \u201cstands on the shoulders of remarkable generations of Black women who have fought and bled for this moment.\u201d The selection, she thought, showed that Biden meant what he\u2019d said onstage in Detroit. \u201cShe represents a new America,\u201d Allison told me. \u201cShe already knows how to speak to that language of solidarity, to that multiracial coalition. She is showing up in the moment we need. This is what the country needs.\u201d Megan Garber: The world that Kamala Harris will navigate This ticket always seemed to some observers (myself included) the most logical choice for Democrats in their fight against Trump. That\u2019s because the pairing reflects the party\u2019s promising but tenuous position as demographic shifts inexorably transform the electorate. By any measure, Harris symbolizes a Democratic future rooted in groups and places that are growing as a share of society: the well-educated and diverse voters centered in the nation\u2019s largest metropolitan areas. A massive recent compilation of survey research by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that the non-college-educated white voters Biden grew up around now constitute only about three in 10 self-identified Democrats, while white voters with a four-year college degree or more constitute nearly as many. People of color represent the plurality, at about 40 percent of Democrats. But because of lagging turnout among some of those people of color\u2014and also because white voters without a college degree are overrepresented in key Rust Belt states\u2014many Democrats concluded after 2016 that they needed a nominee who could win back working-class whites. A solid majority of Democratic primary voters, including all but the youngest African American voters, in effect hired Biden to perform that very specific job. Polls have generally found that Biden is making at least some progress on that front. But he\u2019s continually struggled to generate much excitement among younger people, especially those who are nonwhite. Many Democrats are hopeful that Harris will provide more of the spark with younger people of color that he has not (within the limits of the vice-presidential nominee\u2019s capacity to influence the race). In 2016, just 60 percent of eligible African American voters turned out, down from 67 percent in 2012, according to the Census Bureau. Kasim Reed, the African American former mayor of Atlanta, told me last night he is confident that Harris\u2019s position\u2014combined with antipathy toward Trump and Biden\u2019s own connections with older Black voters\u2014will ensure a dramatic rebound in Black participation. \u201cI am going on the record that Black turnout is going to exceed President [Barack] Obama\u2019s Black turnout,\u201d Reed said. Harris\u2019s selection \u201csends a very important message that high achievement and dedication matter.\u201d Others are more cautious about her potential to energize younger voters. Harris is a demographic bridge between Biden and the modern Democratic Party, but she\u2019s not nearly as much of an ideological bridge. Though she ran sharply to the left during the early stages of her unsteady presidential bid, her record, like Biden\u2019s, is fundamentally moderate. Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, told me that overall, he believes Harris will boost Biden. \u201cI think this will be viewed as real, historic, and likely to be helpful to him in many ways,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cIt will look like a generational change, like someone who is in touch with the country, who can prosecute the case against the administration and against [Mike] Pence\u201d during the vice-presidential debate this fall. Read: Joe Biden\u2019s vice president could be the most powerful in history But to the extent that lagging youth enthusiasm for Biden represents ideological suspicion of him, Greenberg said, Harris isn\u2019t likely to solve the problem. Instead, that will probably require sustained engagement from other, more liberal figures in the party, such as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Uncertainty about Biden\u2019s and Harris\u2019s commitment to the full slate of ambitious policing and civil-rights reforms pushed by many racial-justice advocates threatens friction if the ticket wins, Steve Phillips, the founder of the advocacy group Democracy in Color, predicts. \u201cThese are people who have been strong voices for far-reaching change, and they have found a lot of leaders, including Kamala, wanting,\u201d he told me. But he believes that between now and November, those concerns will be eclipsed by the powerful message Biden has sent about \u201cthe centrality of African Americans in general, and Black women in particular,\u201d to the Democratic Party. \u201cI think that given the depth and the pervasiveness of the \u2026 racism and sexism of this president, to be able to put up a strong, unapologetic, culturally relevant woman of color is really going to resonate with people,\u201d Phillips said. This far into Biden\u2019s career, it\u2019s unlikely that Democrats would have picked him as their nominee in any circumstance other than the pressing need many saw to recapture working-class white voters from Trump. Even in this environment, there\u2019s little chance that the grassroots movements focused on racial justice, climate, and gun control (among other issues) will turn to him for inspiration or direction. \u201cIf we look at Biden for leading, we are going to be disappointed,\u201d Allison said. \u201cHe himself has evolved as a candidate and a leader, but he needs to be surrounded by especially women of color that can speak to the issues of racial and gender justice in a way that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s able to do.\u201d Biden\u2019s inner circle has tilted heavily toward older white men, but by choosing Harris, he\u2019s taken one significant step toward acknowledging his need to open more doors to younger and more racially diverse leaders. Many activists of color were deeply frustrated this year that, even with the party\u2019s most diverse presidential field ever, all of the race\u2019s finalists were white candidates in their 70s: Biden, Sanders, and Warren. Harris\u2019s selection won\u2019t eliminate all the structural inequities that produced that incongruous result. But whether Biden wins or loses in November, her nomination may be remembered as a moment when the pinnacle of Democratic Party leadership came to more closely resemble the base of voters that elects it to power. Even as the GOP at every level remains dominated by white men\u2014starting with Trump and Pence\u2014the Democrats haven\u2019t nominated a presidential ticket of two white men since 2004. It\u2019s difficult to imagine when they ever will again.","headline":"Kamala Harris\u2019s Nomination Is a Turning Point for Democrats","article_name":615187.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/08\/kamala-harris-and-new-democratic-party-coalition\/615187\/","date_published":"2020-08-12 14:18:31","article_length":12036,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:11.530079","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/08\/kamala-harris-and-new-democratic-party-coalition\/615187\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"More Americans than ever are worried about climate change, but they\u2019re not willing to pay much to stop it. A surging number of Americans understand that climate change is happening and believe that it could harm their family and the country, according to a new poll from Yale and George Mason University. But at the same time, Americans are not any more willing to pay money to fight climate change than they were three years ago, says another new poll, conducted by the Associated Press and the University of Chicago. The polls suggest that public opinion about climate change is in a state of upheaval. Even as President Donald Trump has cast doubt on climate change , most Americans have rejected his position. Record numbers of Americans describe climate change as a real and present danger. Nearly a quarter of the country says they already see its tidings in their day-to-day life, saying \u201cpersonal observations of weather\u201d helped convince them of climate change\u2019s reality. Despite this increasing acceptance, there is no clear political path forward. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\u201d were needed to keep the Earth\u2019s temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius. Such a transformation would be, in other words, expensive . But almost 70 percent of Americans say they wouldn\u2019t pay $10 every month to help cool the warming planet. The data are still striking, suggesting that U.S. concern about climate change has leapt by several points in just the past year. More than seven out of 10 Americans now say that global warming is \u201cpersonally important\u201d to them, an increase of nine points since March 2018, according to the Yale poll . More Americans than ever\u201429 percent\u2014also say they are \u201cvery worried\u201d about climate change, an eight-point increase. Read: How I talk to my daughter about climate change These changes are basically unprecedented. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like that in the 10 years we\u2019ve been conducting the study,\u201d says Anthony Leiserowitz , a senior research scientist at Yale who helped oversee the poll. It reflects a large shift, as an outright majority of Americans\u2014a record-high number\u2014believe that climate change could endanger their loved ones. Historically, most Americans have said that global warming \u201cwill harm people in the United States\u201d while insisting that it would \u201cnot harm me, personally.\u201d Now 57 percent of Americans say global warming will harm their neighbors, 56 percent say it will harm their family, and 49 percent say it will harm them personally. These changes show up in both new polls. The AP survey found that seven out of 10 of Americans understand climate change is happening. Even more notable: A slim majority of Republicans\u201452 percent\u2014understand that climate change is real. (The AP asked questions about \u201cclimate change,\u201d while Yale polled about \u201cglobal warming.\u201d The difference in language didn\u2019t seem to change how people replied.) Climate change itself may be driving this remarkable shift. Nearly half of Americans say that the science supporting climate change is \u201cmore convincing\u201d now than it was five years ago, the AP poll found. The vast majority cited \u201crecent extreme weather events\u201d\u2014such as hurricanes, droughts, and heat waves\u2014as especially persuasive. Yet it\u2019s not clear that Americans are willing to do anything about fighting climate change. Many economists support a carbon tax, a policy that makes polluters pay for emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Forty-four percent of Americans say they would support such a tax, according to the AP. Americans become more supportive of a carbon tax, though, when they know where the money it collects will go. Sixty-seven percent of Americans would support a carbon tax if it were used to restore forests and wetlands. Majorities also endorse a tax that would support renewable-energy R&D or public-transit improvements. But even then, most people are not willing to spend much. Seventy percent say they would vote against a $10 monthly fee tacked on to their power bill. Forty percent would oppose a $1 monthly increase. These results don\u2019t lend themselves to straightforward answers about what actions to take next. Recently, some oil companies and Washington elite have endorsed a deficit-neutral carbon fee , a type of carbon tax that regularly mails revenue collected back to every American as a check. The same proposal would also roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules . The AP poll found Americans were least supportive of this plan: Three out of four said they would oppose a carbon tax that \u201ceases climate-related regulation,\u201d and only half liked the idea of a monthly rebate. Yet the opposite strategy hasn\u2019t worked either. In November, voters in Washington State considered a carbon tax that would have supported forest restoration, wind and solar energy, and public transit \u2014everything that people just told the AP pollsters they like. Oil companies spent $31 million to defeat the measure, and voters rejected it by a 12-point margin . Read: The new politics of climate change The AP and the University of Chicago did not directly ask people about a Green New Deal , a still-hazy progressive plan to fight climate change while expanding federal programs. \u201cBut this [poll] sort of supports the idea that it could be politically popular among voters,\u201d says Sam Ori , the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. So what\u2019s going on here? One possibility is that Americans are slowly, grindingly, coming around to the reality of climate change. But political scientists talk about an idea called \u201cthermostatic opinion.\u201d It holds that U.S. public mood works like a seesaw: When one party occupies the White House, voters immediately start to turn against its favored policies and outlook. Though more of an observation than a law, it helps explain why Americans were more conservative in 2013 \u2014just after Barack Obama\u2019s second victory\u2014than they had been in decades. Since Trump is both unpopular and linked to climate denial, isn\u2019t it possible that the public mood will just shift again once he leaves office? Leiserowitz, the Yale scientist, isn\u2019t so sure. Americans are more certain about climate change now than they have been since 2008, he said. But 2008 was a different moment: Both major parties endorsed the reality of climate change, and the Republican candidate in that year\u2019s election, John McCain, even had his own climate plan. So strong cues from both parties\u2019 political elite suggested that it was okay to accept climate change\u2014and public opinion followed. Now the country\u2019s president has vacillated on the reality of climate change, calling it an \u201cexpensive hoax,\u201d then revising his view. Climate change \u201cis one of the most politically polarized issues in Americans,\u201d Leiserowitz said. \u201cSo the fact that Trump is now a hoaxer in chief and yet these numbers are going up is actually really interesting.\u201d","headline":"The Unprecedented Surge in Fear About Climate Change","article_name":580957.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes\/580957\/","date_published":"2019-01-23 12:30:00","article_length":6982,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:12.212822","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes\/580957\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The international body has issued a manual for adapting to a warming world. The United Nations' latest report on climate change contains plenty of dire warnings about the adverse impact \"human interference with the climate system\" is having on everything from sea levels to crop yields to violent conflicts. But the primary message of the study isn't, as John Kerry suggested on Sunday, for countries to collectively reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Instead, the subtext appears to be this: Climate change is happening and will continue to happen for the foreseeable future. As a result, we need to adapt to a warming planet\u2014to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits associated with increasing temperatures\u2014rather than focusing solely on curbing warming in the first place. And it's businesses and local governments, rather than the international community, that can lead the way. \u201cThe really big breakthrough in this report is the new idea of thinking about managing climate change,\u201d Chris Field, the co-chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) study, said this week, adding that governments, companies, and communities are already experimenting with \u201cclimate-change adaptation.\u201d First, a definition of terms is in order. Since the 1990s, the climate-policy community has been engaged in a debate about whether to focus on reducing emissions (\"mitigation\"), managing climate change (\"adaptation\"), or both. But in a 2007 article for Nature , a team of academics gave three reasons for why the \"taboo on adaptation\" was gradually disappearing: 1.\u00a0 The \"timescale mismatch\" : Even if world leaders take decisive action to cut emissions (a big \"if\"), it won't have an impact on the climate for decades, and greenhouse-gas concentrations will continue to increase in the meantime. 2.\u00a0  The emissions fallacy: People are vulnerable to the climate for reasons other than greenhouse-gas emissions, including factors like socioeconomic inequality and rapid population growth along coasts. 3.\u00a0 The demands of developing countries: While wealthy countries account for most greenhouse-gas emissions, poor countries suffer the most damage from climate change. And these developing countries want the international community to help them become less vulnerable to the extreme climactic events they're facing now , rather than arguing over emission targets that will theoretically protect them in the future. The IPCC's early climate reports in the 1990s barely mentioned climate-change adaptation. But that changed in the panel's 2001 edition , which noted that \"adaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement climate mitigation efforts.\" The IPCC spent two pages discussing \"adaptation options\" in its 2007 study , and this week has devoted more than four chapters to the strategy, including a graph that shows our ability to adapt to climate change in three eras: the present; the near-future we've committed ourselves to based on current emissions; and the distant future we still have the capacity to shape. Adaptation hasn't received nearly as much attention on the international level as mitigation has, though that could change with this latest UN report. But on the national level, where much of the action on climate change has shifted amid international gridlock , adaptation-focused thinking is becoming more common. According to a recent study by Globe International, which tracked climate legislation across 66 countries, the number of national climate laws around the world has increased from 40 in 1997 to nearly 500 now. Some of these laws are mitigation-focused, like Switzerland's aggressive carbon-dioxide-reduction act , but overall the \"momentum in climate change legislation [is] shifting from industrialised countries to developing countries and emerging markets,\" which \"has gone hand in hand with a rise in legislation covering adaptation.\" In Africa, key risks revolve around insect-transmitted illnesses, clean-water availability, and agricultural productivity due to intensifying droughts. Terms such as \"sustainable urban development,\" \"agroforestry,\" and \"diversifying livelihoods\" pop up in the corresponding list of adaptation prospects. Central and South America face all of the above, too, though adaptation responses may focus more on equipping public-health services to fight the spread of vector-borne diseases.","headline":"The UN's New Focus: Surviving, Not Stopping, Climate Change","article_name":359929.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-uns-new-focus-surviving-not-stopping-climate-change\/359929\/","date_published":"2014-04-01 12:39:58","article_length":4384,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:12.495143","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-uns-new-focus-surviving-not-stopping-climate-change\/359929\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Global warming may have turned an already historic dry spell into the third-worst drought of the past 1,000 years. Every so often, the American West seems to lurch into something called a \u201cmega-drought.\u201d The rains falter, the rivers wither, and the forests become tinder boxes waiting for a spark. Mega-droughts are notoriously hard to study\u2014the last one happened in the 16th century\u2014but what we do know is worrisome. In the 1540s, a few wet years in the middle of a mega-drought may have triggered one of the worst disease epidemics ever recorded. According to research unveiled last week, mega-droughts may no longer be history. On Thursday, a team of climate scientists argued that the American West may currently be experiencing its first mega-drought in more than 500 years. A record-breaking period of aridity set in around the year 2000 and continues to this day, they said. \u201cThe last 19 years have been equivalent to the worst 19 years of the worst mega-droughts on record,\u201d said Park Williams , a professor of bioclimatology at Columbia University, at a presentation of the work. Only three recent mega-droughts\u2014in the late 800s, the mid-1100s, and the late 1500s\u2014were worse than the current period, he added. Climate change seems to be driving a good chunk of the problem. \u201cThe current drought is substantially worse than it would have been without global warming,\u201d Williams said. The drought was 62 percent more severe than it would have been, he said, due to human-caused climate change. * Williams presented the results to a standing-room-only session at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s fall meeting, the year\u2019s largest planetary-science conference. The work has not yet been peer-reviewed. While it\u2019s a common practice to share preliminary work at a scientific meeting, Williams didn\u2019t comment directly for this article; academic norms discourage researchers from publicly discussing a study before its formal publication. But other scientists told me that the work makes sense, saying it was \u201cquite plausible\u201d that the American Southwest is in a mega-drought right now. And no matter what, it\u2019s clear that the region is in the middle of a far-reaching climatic transformation. \u201cThe definition of mega-drought technically is open to debate,\u201d said Jonathan Overpeck , a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. Two decades ago, he and the climate scientist Connie Woodhouse coined the term mega-drought  in a paper , specifying that such a drought must last 20 years or more. \u201cThe drought in the Southwest is now in its 19th year. So it\u2019s right on the cusp of technically being a mega-drought,\u201d Overpeck told me. The current drought is \u201crelentless,\u201d he said, with consequences that reverberate across the West. \u201cIt\u2019s reflected in the levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell , the two largest reservoirs in our country \u2026 You see it in the way the forests are outright dying in some places, in big insect outbreaks as [plants] are weakened by a lack of moisture in the soil, in more catastrophic wildfires. There\u2019s a lot of signs this drought is unusual.\u201d He said that two different events seem to be driving the crisis. First, the region is receiving less rain than normal. Second, the Southwest as a whole is systematically warming up and drying out. It\u2019s becoming a more desertlike place, a process that scientists call aridification . \u201cMost of the work points to aridification being dominant\u201d in driving the modern drought, Overpeck said. The new work from Williams and his colleagues may support the same idea. They began by looking at the climatic record preserved in tens of thousands of tree rings across the American West. By using a simple form of machine learning on that data and calibrating it to modern weather records they pieced together the past 1,200 years of soil moisture in the West. (Williams\u2019s team includes Ed Cook, who practically invented the modern study of tree rings .) Read: The map hidden in the Pacific Northwest\u2019s tree rings Consulting this record, they found that the current drought does not perfectly resemble historic mega-droughts. While previous droughts were concentrated in just one or two places in the West, the current drought covers almost half of the country. Climate models suggest that this huge territorial extent may be caused by the extreme heat and dry air that\u2019s plagued western states in the past few decades. \u201cWhat may have just been a drought in the Southwest is now a drought across the entire study region,\u201d Williams said at the conference. Scientists have long suspected that aridification could cause problems across the West\u2014mega-droughts included. Two years ago, a paper in Science Advances warned\u2014with 99 percent certainty\u2014 that a southwestern mega-drought would occur by 2100 if greenhouse-gas emissions continued to balloon through the next several decades. In another paper, Williams and some of his same colleagues found that increased heat in the West has exploded the size of wildfires since the mid-1980s . Read: The simple reason that humans can\u2019t control wildfires But Williams believes that climate change is not solely to blame. \u201cThe current drought would have been occurring anyway without global warming, but it would only have been the eighth- or ninth-worst on record,\u201d he said. Instead, it\u2019s the fourth-worst in the past 1,200 years. Woodhouse , who coined the term mega-drought with Overpeck, told me that this effect may be the most important finding of the new paper. \u201cThe current 19-year period is different [from] 19-year periods in the past for the simple reason that it is occurring under warmer temperatures,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn essence, a garden-variety drought (in terms of precipitation deficits) + warming = a much more severe drought.\u201d Overpeck agreed. \u201cThe warming is having a huge effect\u2014a huge effect on water resources and a huge effect on forests,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople knew there would be an effect, but we didn\u2019t know it would come this big, and this fast.\u201d * This article previously misstated the amount by which human-caused climate change worsened the current drought.","headline":"The Southwest May Be Deep Into a Climate-Changed Mega-Drought","article_name":578248.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/12\/us-southwest-already-mega-drought\/578248\/","date_published":"2018-12-18 12:10:00","article_length":6089,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:13.587028","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/12\/us-southwest-already-mega-drought\/578248\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"As record-breaking high tides overwhelm Hawaii, people are getting a preview of what life will be like in the decades to come. The water is everywhere. For the second time in a month, Hawaii\u2019s coastlines have been swamped by epic tides. The phenomenon, known as a king tide, is actually a convergence of a few different factors: high lunar tides, rising sea levels associated with last year\u2019s strong El Ni\u00f1o and climate change, swirling pockets of ocean eddies, and a robust south swell\u2014that is, big waves rolling onto south-facing shores. King tides happen routinely in the Hawaiian Islands\u2014a few times a year, usually\u2014but this year\u2019s batch have been particularly extreme. Data from federal tide stations around Hawaii show that water levels have been up to six inches above predicted tidal heights since early last year. In April, levels peaked at more than nine inches above predicted tides and broke the record high for any water level around Hawaii since 1905. Scientists say the record is likely to be broken again in 2017. Several Honolulu roadways have been submerged. Beaches have been washed out. Beachfront hotels have canceled shorefront entertainment and readied generators. Property owners living near the coasts were told to move electronics and other valuables up to the second floor of their houses and park their cars elsewhere. People photographed fish swimming down the streets. And all around the islands, small mountains of sand have been deposited in parking lots and other strange places\u2014spots the waves should never reach. For the people of Hawaii, alarm bells are ringing. King tides like this aren\u2019t just a historic anomaly; they\u2019re a sign of what\u2019s to come. \u201cWithin a few decades this will be the new normal,\u201d said Chip Fletcher, associate dean of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawai\u02bbi, in a university statement . \u201cHawaii should consider this a practice run, and reevaluate policies and development practices accordingly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a risk big enough to get the attention of officials who usually watch things like hurricanes and tsunamis,\u201d said the local TV reporter Gina Mangieri, who reported for KHON that emergency-management officials had called for \u201call-hands-on-deck coordination\u201d across state, county, and federal agencies to protect critical infrastructure and the public. Scientists believe Hawaii could experience a sea-level increase of three feet by the year 2100, which is in line with global predictions of sea-level change and which would substantially reshape life on the Islands. That\u2019s part of why scientists are enlisting volunteers to help photograph and describe incremental high tides across Hawaii. \u201cFirst-person experiences that are place-based and familiar reinforce that climate changes impacts are local in nature and not a distant phenomenon,\u201d the university\u2019s King Tides Project website says. More than 60 volunteers have submitted more than 900 photos so far. Scientists have measured other significant environmental changes already under way. The rate of warming air temperature in Hawaii has quadrupled in the past four decades. The cooling trade winds that help bring rain have diminished. Overall rainfall is declining, raising the risk of drought and threatening freshwater supplies, according to a 2014 report by the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program. \u201cIt is now widely accepted that human activities are affecting global climate systems in a significant way,\u201d the authors of that report wrote. \u201cWhile there are disagreements about the exact nature, magnitude, and timing of these changes, the science is clear that global climate change is being observed.\u201d Hawaii officials are already in the process of developing statewide maps to predict and track Hawaii\u2019s most vulnerable areas for erosion and flooding, outlining how climate change will alter the Islands in 2030, 2050, 2075, and 2100. In the meantime, an even bigger king tide than the ones in April and May is forecast for June.","headline":"The Ghost of Climate-Change Future","article_name":528471.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/the-ghost-of-climate-change-future\/528471\/","date_published":"2017-05-30 14:47:09","article_length":4006,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:14.845577","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/the-ghost-of-climate-change-future\/528471\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Experts on ecology, conservation, and climate change offer their reasons for optimism and pessimism going into 2016. The two words \u201cclimate\u201d and \u201cchange\u201d are so routinely strung together that just saying them as a pair\u2014\u201cclimate change\u201d\u2014seems to somehow obscure the full weight of the phenomenon they describe, to say nothing of its consequences. But in those moments when one pauses to consider the ramifications of human activity on the planet for generations and generations ahead, things can feel beyond bleak. And yet: This past year saw the nations of the world reached their first-ever agreement on an ambitious plan to rein in emissions, perhaps the most significant progress yet made on this issue. We reached out to some of the leading scholars of climate change, conservation, and ecology, and asked them what, as the Earth begins yet another trip around the sun, is giving them cause for hope and despair. Below are their answers, lightly edited for length and clarity. Robert Glennon, p rofessor of law and public policy at the University of Arizona Reason for despair: I despair that we don\u2019t consider water to be scarce or valuable. A century of lax water laws and regulations has spoiled most Americans. We turn on the tap and out comes as much water as we want for less than we pay for cable television or cellphone service. When most Americans think of water, they think of it as similar to air\u2014as infinite and inexhaustible. In reality, it\u2019s both finite and exhaustible. Because we don\u2019t respect water as remarkable, we use needless quantities for frivolous purposes, such as growing grass in the desert. And because we don\u2019t pay the real cost of water (only the cost of the infrastructure to provide it), we remove the incentive to conserve. Perhaps most important, our innovation economy has encouraged engineers and inventors to create water-saving technologies that extend our supply; but the price of water is so low that few of them have viable business plans. Reason for hope: We have a suite of options to confront the crisis and prevent it from becoming a catastrophe. These options include conservation, which remains the low-hanging fruit; reuse of treated municipal effluent; and desalination of ocean or brackish water. We can also price water sensibly to encourage conservation, while protecting access to water for persons of modest means. Finally, we can use the power of market forces to encourage a modest reallocation of water from low to higher-value uses. A low single-digit percent reduction in agricultural water consumption would solve the municipal and industrial water-supply problem. Modernization of farm irrigation systems, paid for by cities and industry, would protect the viability of rural communities and secure needed supplies for the urban sector. None of these options requires a radical change in our behavior, but they will require the moral courage and the political will to act. Margo Oge,  f ormer director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality of the Environmental Protection Agency Reason for despair: Climate change is the biggest challenge our planet faces. The science is clear, the risks are real, and the phenomenon\u2019s impact on every part of our planet is increasingly visible. In mid-December, nearly 200 countries met in Paris to secure a historic agreement to reduce the impacts of the global threat. The negotiators for every single country involved have accepted that we need to take immediate and substantive action on this threat. Back at home, however, Congressional Republicans continued their decades of denial. In a symbolic rebuff of global urgency on the issue, both the House and Senate voted to repeal President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. By the time our legislators\u2014a few hundred people\u2014finally accept the overwhelming scientific evidence about the threat, I despair that time will have run out for future generations. I fear that killing, or endlessly delaying, the nation\u2019s serious efforts to mitigate this threat will be catastrophic: rising seas swallowing island nations, floods wiping out towns and villages, unprecedented heat waves and drought destroying crops and lives, and even global instability that provokes wars. Reason for hope: What gives me optimism is watching our country take a positive role in the Paris international-climate agreements after decades of foot dragging on the issue. When the United States leads, other countries follow. This means that the U.S. efforts to secure strong climate actions in Paris and at home will make a hugely positive impact globally on carbon emissions. The United States has, in fact, long been a leader on environmental technology innovation. In the 1970s, it was American car-emission standards that led to the development of catalytic convertors. These devices were the first to ever clean up the toxic soup coming out of cars\u2019 tailpipes. The rest of the world followed America. Today you can\u2019t find a car without one. After we banned leaded gas, Europe and the rest of the world came along. In 2009 we initiated another world-leading effort, regulations that will cut automotive carbon pollution in half as well as double the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles by 2025. For decades, American environmental efforts have led to innovation, saved lives, and created jobs. As a result of these regulations, our car industry is today undergoing a technological and economic revolution. Our automakers are building the most fuel-efficient vehicle fleet in history and are already ahead on a trajectory to doubling fuel economy by 2025. The world needs the United States to continue and expand its technological leadership in mitigating climate change. Peter Singer,  p rofessor of bioethics at Princeton University Reason for despair: One thing that brings me close to despair is the fact that, just in the West, we seemed to have turned a corner in regard to meat eating and factory farming\u2014both are now on the decline\u2014the resulting reduction in animal suffering and greenhouse gas emissions is being swamped by the growth in meat eating in China and other parts of Asia. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t despair because the situation is not hopeless. As long as there is hope of change for the better, I\u2019m too busy trying to bring about that change to lose myself in despair. Reason for hope: More and more people are seeking fulfillment in their lives by turning away from the consumer lifestyle and instead living in accord with their values. The emerging movement known as effective altruism is one outcome of that, and it is having an impact. I\u2019m encouraged by the tremendous progress made over the past 25 years in reducing extreme poverty and improving life expectancy worldwide. Infant mortality, for example, has been cut by more than half since 1990, despite rising population. If we continue to put more resources\u2014our intelligence and our skills, as well as our money\u2014into using reason and evidence to make the world a better place, then I am confident that we can make even more progress over the next 25 years. Elizabeth Marino,  a ssistant professor of anthropology\u200b at Oregon State Unviersity Reason for despair: As an anthropologist working alongside indigenous communities in the United States, it\u2019s hard not to see climate change as another wave of violence inherent in the colonial ideal. Colonized geographies like communities in Alaska, small nation states in the Pacific, and large nations in sub-Saharan Africa all share the heaviest burdens of a rapidly changing climate, all share vulnerabilities to those changes produced by unjust economic and political systems, and all are limited in social and cultural expression by the narrow-mindedness of what is deemed culturally acceptable by the \u201cWest.\u201d These burdens are all part of climate injustice. But even aside from this new form of colonial violence, I despair because, more than any other crisis, climate change needs alternative cultural models for framing problems and non-Western solutions. \u00a0Unfortunately, many accept as \u201cnatural\u201d merely one set of ideas borne from very particular \u201cWestern\u201d worldviews: the necessity of growth; monetary value as determinant of inherent value; the nature\/culture dichotomy; competition as the driver of production; technological \u201cfixes\u201d as paramount. I despair when the solutions and rhetoric around climate-change mitigation and climate justice are embedded in these presuppositions; when the world stays narrow. Juliet B. Schor,  p rofessor of sociology at Boston College\u200b Reason for despair: Despair? Yes, it is there. Not because I don\u2019t think that eventually we will have a low- or zero-carbon world. We will. But how can one not despair at the certain destruction we\u2019ve already ensured with the warming and chaos that is now built in to the climate system? This month flooding in my husband\u2019s home city of Chennai reached second floors, with more than 1.8 million people displaced. In one 24-hour period there was nearly 11 inches of rainfall. California remains in the grip of a powerful drought. It is 60 degrees in Boston, in \u00a0December, in what\u2019s likely the world\u2019s warmest recorded year, a distinction which may be eclipsed 12 months from now. All the while, the politics of hatred are rising, like the sea levels. Reason for hope: COP21, the UN talks in Paris, ended with a degree of hope that is unprecedented in the world of climate. Despite the absence of a binding agreement or emissions promises that have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, there has been almost delirious optimism, even from many environmental activists. (Not from all, of course. James Hansen and Bill McKibben have been outspoken in their criticisms of the weaknesses of the treaty, and they\u2019re right.) But I find four major reasons to be hopeful. The first is that China is acting decisively to reduce emissions from coal. The second is that renewable energy is now an economically viable alternative to fossil fuels, and will be even more so if we can eliminate the $450 billion a year in subsidies for the dirty fuels. The third is that the fossil-fuel companies are without doubt on the defensive. From the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline to government investigations into Exxon\u2019s cover up of its own climate research, the behavior of this industry is finally on view. True, it is still quite powerful in Congress, but the combination of science, economics, and exposure is sounding the industry\u2019s death knell. As we\u2019ve already seen with coal, I predict that oil and gas won\u2019t survive the mounting pressure to \u201ckeep it in the ground.\u201d And that brings me to my fourth reason for hope: the growth of a global grassroots movement for climate justice and ecological sanity. It has taken a long time for us to get here, but it\u2019s now unstoppable. Robin Bronen, e xecutive director of the Alaska Institute for Justice and a senior research scientist at the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks\u200b Reason for despair: Living in Alaska, the only Arctic state in the United States, I am witnessing the fast-forward of geologic time. My despair increases as I watch Arctic ecosystems collapse. The recently negotiated Paris Climate Agreement includes aspirational language to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But in Alaska, winter temperatures have already increased 3.5 degrees Celsius since 1975. Ice and snow, iconic elements of the land and sea in the Arctic, are disappearing. The winter of 2014-2015 was the lowest snow season on record in Anchorage, Alaska\u2019s largest urban center. Glaciers are losing 75 billion tons of ice annually. Arctic Ocean sea ice has decreased by 36 percent in the last three decades. For indigenous communities in Alaska, these changes are life-threatening. Kivalina, Shishmaref, and Newtok, are three of the most imperiled communities. Each has chosen to relocate as a long-term adaptation strategy because sea ice no longer protects their communities from hurricane-force storms that eat the land on which they live. In presentations to U.S. government agencies and Congress, Shishmaref residents plead : The no action option for Shishmaref is the annihilation of our community \u2026 We are unique, and need to be valued as a national treasure by the people of the United States. We deserve the attention and help of the American people and the federal government ... Shishmaref, we are worth saving. Due to intense and prolonged advocacy efforts, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and President Obama traveled to Alaska this past summer. Despite these visits, no community knows when or if it will be able to relocate to higher ground to protect their unique way of life and connection to the land of their ancestors. The gross injustice of their experience adds to my despair because those who have done the least to cause our climate crisis are bearing enormous losses. Their experience also shows that we are completely unprepared to respond to the humanitarian crisis which will be caused by rising seas forcing millions of people from their homes, their heritage, and the places they love. Reason for hope: Solidarity\u2014the recognition that all of humanity is connected to each other and to the Earth\u2014gives me hope. This understanding that we are one people living on a shared homeland is embedded in the climate-justice movement. The Arctic, the harbinger of dramatic environmental changes, reminds us of this connection. Decreased Arctic sea ice affects the polar jet stream and contributes to the drought in California and the epic flooding and snowfall events in lower latitudes. The melting of Greenland threatens coastal communities all over the world. More than 50 percent of Greenland was melting in July 2015. In protests across the planet, people are standing together, across countries, Indigenous nations, ethnicities, age, gender, and class to demand that our human rights be protected, that the Earth\u2019s ecosystems be protected and that those least responsible for our climate crisis be provided the resources to adapt and protect their lives. Gernot Wagner,  s enior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund Reason for despair: Climate change. It\u2019s the perfect problem : more global, more long-term, more irreversible, and more uncertain that virtually any other public-policy problem facing us. Climate change is a lot worse than most of us realize. Almost regardless of what we do on the mitigation front, we are in for a whole lot of hurt. On the policy front, we have now talked for more than 20 years about how we need to turn this ship around \u201cwithin a decade.\u201d Not unlike the ever-elusive fusion technology, that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Global carbon emissions declined slightly this year\u2014for the first time ever without a global recession\u2014but the trends are still pointing in the wrong direction. Worse, turning around emissions is only the very first step. It\u2019s not enough to stabilize the flow of water going into the bathtub when the goal is to prevent the tub from overflowing. We need to turn around atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. That means turning off the flow of water into the tub\u2014getting net emissions to zero and below. It doesn\u2019t help our efforts that many people seem to confuse the two. A study involving over 200 MIT graduate students faced with this same question revealed that even they confuse emissions and concentrations\u2014water flowing into the tub and water levels there. If MIT graduate students can\u2019t get this one right, what hope is there for the rest of us? Reason for hope: Climate change. Many signs point to some real momentum to finally tackle this momentous challenge. The Paris Climate Accord builds an important foundation. It enables transparency, accountability, and markets to help solve the problem. Many governments are moving forward with pricing carbon: from California to China, from Sweden to South Africa, we see ambitious action to reign in emissions in some 50 jurisdictions. Meanwhile, lots is happening on the clean-energy front. That\u2019s particularly true for solar photovoltaic power, which has climbed up the learning curve\u2014and down the cost curve\u2014faster than most would have expected only five years ago. That has also provided an important jolt for sensible climate policy . Then there\u2019s R&D for entirely new technologies. Bill Gates leading an investment coalition with $1 billion of his own money is only one important sign of movement in that direction. The excitement for self-driving, electric vehicles is palpable up and down Silicon Valley, to name just one potentially significant example. In the end, it\u2019s precisely this mix of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and, of course, Washington that will lead\u2014and, in part, is already leading\u2014to the necessary revolution in a number of important sectors, energy and transportation chief among them.","headline":"Can the Planet Be Saved?","article_name":421794.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2015\/12\/hope-despair-climate-change\/421794\/","date_published":"2015-12-28 19:44:26","article_length":16867,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:15.587768","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2015\/12\/hope-despair-climate-change\/421794\/","source":"atlantic"}

It was an \"ice release\"\u2014a collapse of a glacial mass known as a serac . Rather than getting swept up by a rush of powdery snow across a slope, the victims fell under the blunt force of house-sized ice blocks tumbling through the Khumbu Icefall , an unavoidable obstacle on the most popular route up Everest. The worst accident in the mountain's history has effectively ended the 2014 climbing season. And some see global warming as the key culprit. \"I am at Everest Basecamp right now and things are dire because of climate change,\" John All , a climber, scientist, and professor of geography at Western Kentucky University, told me by email. \"The ice is melting at unprecedented rates and [that] greatly increases the risk to climbers.\" \"You could say [that] climate change closed Mt. Everest this year,\" he added. Climbers had warily eyed the serac that collapsed on April 18 for years. In fact, a major expedition outfitter canceled its climbing season in 2012 because of it\u2014a decision vividly reconstructed by Jon Krakauer in The New Yorker last week: For many years, the most lucrative commercial guiding operation on Mt. Everest has been a company called Himalayan Experience, or Himex, which is owned by a New Zealand mountaineer named Russell Brice. In the spring of 2012, more than a month into the climbing season, he became increasingly worried about a bulge of glacial ice three hundred yards wide that was frozen tenuously to Everest\u2019s West Shoulder, hanging like a massive sword of Damocles directly over the main route up the Nepal side of the mountain. Ice frequently falls from this hanging glacier on the West Shoulder, and traversing the Icefall has always been treacherous . \"Ice doctors\" who install ladders and ropes in the area have long adjusted and readjusted the infrastructure in response to the collapses, big and small, that occur there on a daily basis. But experts believe these dangers are multiplying as average temperatures rise. In Krakauer's words, \"the pronounced warming of the Himalayan climate in recent years has made the Icefall more unstable than ever, and there is still no way to predict when a serac is going to topple over.\" Or take it from Tim Rippel, who runs Peak Freaks and was blogging from Base Camp last week: As a professional member of the Canadian Avalanche Association I have my educated concerns. The mountain has been deteriorating rapidly the past three years due [to] global warming and the breakdown in the Khumbu ice-fall is dramatic, especially at the upper icefall. We need to learn more about what is going on up there. Each day we sit and listen to the groaning and crashing of the glacier. The Icefall is a formation of the Khumbu glacier, which stretches between Everest and a neighboring peak called Lhotse. And, like others around the globe, this glacier is melting . (A caveat: Glaciers in the nearby Karakoram region , home to the towering K2, appear to be growing, according to the latest research .) The Khumbu glacier shifts by a few feet each day and has shrunk by more than half a mile in length\u00a0( from 12,040 meters to 11,097 meters ) over the past 50 years\u2014though it's by no means the fastest-retreating glacier in the region. Base Camp, which sits on the glacier below the Icefall, has lost about 40 feet\u00a0in elevation over the same time period, according to the glaciologist Mauri Pelto . \"If it wasn't the tallest mountain in the world, you would never put yourself on a glacier this active,\" veteran guide Adrian Ballinger\u00a0 recently told the Associated Press. The Himalayas have been called \"the third pole\" because the mountain range stores more snow and ice than any other region in the world except the North and South Poles. According to NASA , temperatures in this region have been increasing by 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since 1980, a rate twice as high as the global average. And the impacts of global warming  in the Himalayas are similar to those in the Arctic and Antarctic, with one big difference: Many more people live around this \"third pole\" than around the North or South Poles. As a result of this relative population density, climate change is exacting human costs not just on Everest but in the entire region. Some 1.3 billion people \u00a0 depend on rivers that run from Himalayan glaciers like the Khumbu. A couple hundred million\u00a0of those people live close enough to the mountains to be endangered by devastating wipeouts from  glacial flood outbursts , which occur when glaciers melt into lakes and the lakes then overflow\u2014\" high-altitude disasters in the making ,\" by one environmental journalist's estimation. There are thousands of glacial lakes in the Himalayas, and many of them are concentrated around Everest. The UN's climate-change panel may have been wrong in 2007 when it estimated that Himalayan glaciers will be gone by 2035 (it later conceded that its predictions were \"poorly substantiated\"). But it's reiterating now that the world's tallest mountains truly are melting , endangering the water supplies of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. These dramatic changes in climate are occurring at a time when human traffic on Everest is increasing. The best time to summit the mountain is in the middle of May, when the fierce winds of the jet stream, which whip around the summit almost all year long, temporarily move north. A perfect day to summit is one with little wind and no precipitation. But there may be fewer of those days in the future. And yet,\u00a0 with the exception of this year , there will likely be more summit-seekers angling for positions on the route during narrowing, and increasingly unpredictable, windows of favorable weather. The mad Everest traffic jam of 2012 could become an annual affair. Crowded lines to the summit pose a different kind of danger than crumbling seracs in the Khumbu Icefall. The editors of\u00a0 Outside \u00a0 lay out the scenario like this : Hundreds of people show up at Base Camp\u2014some with limited skills and experience but all committed to scaling Everest. As the climbing season reaches its peak, only one or two occasions may arise when conditions are ripe for ascent to the top. When that first \" summit window \" opens up, climbers race to take advantage of it, leading to dangerous bottlenecks in the mountain's high-altitude \" death zone .\" (One solution to this issue might be to climb Everest at a different time of year; in the 1980s, for instance, more climbers attempted to scale Everest in the fall than in the spring.) Increasingly volatile climactic conditions on Everest may have contributed to the premature end of the 2014 climbing season. But they're unlikely to put a permanent freeze on expeditions up the mountain\u2014and not just because of the growing demand from climbers. A few years ago, ClimateWire interviewed\u00a0 a Sherpa who had participated in Sir Edmund Hillary's historic expedition and, upon returning to Base Camp in 2011, was shocked by how much had changed since 1953. He predicted the end of snow on Everest within the next few decades. \"It's going to be no more snow, only rock,\" he told a reporter. However, he also said that the livelihood of his community was of primary concern, and that keeping climbers away was not an option: \"If we stop the tourists to save the mountains, we don't have anything to do. Just grow potatoes and eat and sit.\"","headline":"The Year Climate Change Closed Everest","article_name":361114.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-year-climate-change-closed-everest\/361114\/","date_published":"2014-04-28 19:58:54","article_length":7495,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:15.652167","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-year-climate-change-closed-everest\/361114\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"David Wallace-Wells, author of the new book The Uninhabitable Earth ,  describes why climate change might alter our sense of time. The year is 2100. The United States has been devastated by climate change. Super-powerful hurricanes regularly ravage coastal cities. Wildfires have overrun Los Angeles several times over. And it is dangerous to go outside on some summer days\u2014children and the elderly risk being broiled alive. In such a world as that one, will we give up on the idea of historical progress? Should we even believe in it now? In his new book, The Uninhabitable Earth , the writer David Wallace-Wells considers how global warming will change not only the experience of human life but also our ideas and philosophies about it. It\u2019s possible, he told me recently, that climate change will make us believe that history is \u201csomething that takes us backward rather than forward.\u201d \u201cThe 21st century will be dominated by climate change in the same way that \u2026 the 19th century in the West was dominated by modernity or industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be an area of human life that is untouched by it.\u201d I recently talked to Wallace-Wells about his new book, the difficulty of writing stories about climate change, and which science-fiction prophecy he believes came true. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. Robinson Meyer: You had the big cover story in New York , and then you wrote a book. What did you learn writing the book that maybe wasn\u2019t as clear when you were writing the first story? David Wallace-Wells: I\u2019d written a previous cover story about bee death , but I hadn\u2019t done a ton of straight-ahead climate writing. And in a sort of perverse way, I think that was one of the qualifying things about my background for that story and this book. I was coming at it fresh. I had a different perspective than people who had devoted their lives to it\u2014which is that I don\u2019t actually, like, intuitively care all that much about nature per se. And so [in the story] I wasn\u2019t writing about the plight of the animals or the tragedy of the rainforest. I was focused on people. In that first piece, I also really focused on worst-case scenarios. I looked at scenarios north of 4 degrees [Celsius of global warming], 5 degrees, 6 degrees, even 8 degrees\u2014and I thought it was very important to introduce those scenarios to the broader public because they were so far from what even the general, engaged, liberal understanding of climate change was. Read: Al Gore: America is close to a \u2018political tipping point\u2019 on climate change It made me think that there were all of these other downstream effects of climate change that even academics hadn\u2019t begun to contemplate. We have this idea over the last few centuries that history may be erratic, it may punish some people here and there, but generally over time, as time marches forward, we see progress, we see lives getting more prosperous and safer and healthier. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to say that climate will completely undo that, I think it\u2019s quite likely that it does transform that perspective in some way. It\u2019s certainly within the realm of conceivability that damages accumulate so significantly that we totally drop that idea about history as an arrow of progress and start thinking of it as something that is much less reliable, even something that takes us backward rather than forward. Meyer: I want to talk about that more, but first I want to follow up on this idea of the \u201cgeneral, engaged understanding\u201d of climate change. I think about that a lot. What do you think the general understanding of the issue is? Wallace-Wells: It\u2019s actually changing quite quickly. I think that my article played a small role in that, but the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report was a way bigger deal. It really does seem to have awakened a huge amount of alarmism and panic, and it also sort of invited scientists to speak more openly about the issue. But when I first started writing, I was motivated by the divergence between what I saw coming out of academic research and how those stories were being told in most mainstream publications. And that was along three points. The first point is about the speed of change. The emphasis was always about how slow climate change was, and how it was hard to deal with because there was no urgency to it. But the animating fact to me is that more than half of all the emissions ever produced from the burning of fossil fuels have been produced in just the last three decades. That transformed my perspective\u2014I realized that this is something that we\u2019re doing very much in real time. The second thing that we sort of misunderstood was the scope of it. So much of the storytelling is focused on sea-level rise and the melting of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. Obviously that\u2019s a huge part of the climate story. But it also gives this false sense that it\u2019s a problem that has local impacts\u2014like if you stay off the shoreline, you\u2019re likely to be safe. The third problem was the severity. Scientists had often talked about this 2-degree [Celsius of global temperature rise] threshold as a kind of meaningful mark of climate horror, and I think that most readers understood that to mean that that was about as bad as it could get. But we can now see that 2 degrees of warming is functionally a floor for where we\u2019ll be, and not a ceiling. Meyer: You process a lot of scholarly or humanistic writing about climate change in your book. Whose work has stuck with you? Wallace-Wells: The people who\u2019ve written about the politics of climate\u2014especially the relationship of climate and capitalism. Naomi Klein is to me sort of like the North Star. Jed Purdy\u2019s work \u2014he is more sort of earnestly theoretical, but he is valuable in placing the challenge of climate in the long tradition of political philosophy. Honestly, the person whose work most flicked this light on for me was Amitav Ghosh and his book The Great Derangement , which is about narrative. I found a lot to disagree with in his interpretation, mostly because I come from kind of a literary background. I used to work at The  Paris Review , and I studied all this stuff in college, and I had a slightly different idea of what the basic function of novel writing is. Therefore I had a different interpretation of why we don\u2019t have good novels written about climate change. Meyer: He argues that climate change is uniquely hard to write stories about, right? Where did you disagree with him? Wallace-Wells: Ghosh\u2019s basic argument is that the novel is a form about the inner life of an individual. And the problem of climate change is a very different category of problem for him. You can place the stories of individuals within it, but you end up with something like The Day After Tomorrow , where it\u2019s like, Oh, here\u2019s a person who\u2019s dealing with a struggle, but the story is also about climate change . And the disconnect feels almost corny and staged. I tended to think about it more in terms of responsibility and villainy. I think that we have a very hard time processing our own complicity as Westerners reading novels and wondering about climate change. We really prefer to see ourselves as truly innocent, and therefore want our climate storytelling to reassure us about our own culpability, and tell us in fact that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem in our culture, outside of narrative. I think this often takes the form of vilifying oil companies. I don\u2019t want to come off as someone who thinks oil companies are forces for good. But I also realized that when I buy a flight to take a vacation, I\u2019m not doing that as a tool of the oil companies. When I eat a hamburger, I\u2019m not doing that as a tool of the oil companies. Everything about the way that we all live in the modern world [has] a carbon footprint, and therefore we all share in responsibility for this damage. I hope that that sort of revelation will inspire people to some kind of collective action. Lifestyle choices are ultimately so small that anything other than political action and organizing seems to me effectively a diversion. But I also am not approaching the subject really as an advocate, but as a truth teller and storyteller. Meyer: Do you think there\u2019s a way to write that kind of narrative that doesn\u2019t wind up feeling like The Jungle ? Which ends with a giant Socialist rally, and the narrator being absorbed into the fervor of the crowd. Or, I really enjoyed [the 2018 film] Sorry to Bother You , but it has a very similar kind of arc in which the politics save the main character. Wallace-Wells: I guess it depends on whether what you\u2019re looking for in a narrative is polemic or humanity. I actually think that one of the features of my writing on this subject is that it\u2014I hope this doesn\u2019t sound too grand to say\u2014but it demonstrates that if you handle them right, the simple accumulation of facts can take on an enormous narrative force. And I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s something that many other writers about climate have done before. We are still in the infant stage of figuring out how to tell stories about this issue. Going forward, I suspect that the more interesting narrative forms are likely to background climate change and make it appear like the theater in which human dramas are unfolding. Think about, for instance, a climate refugee camp, where the story is effectively some rivalry between two quasi-criminal-like figures in the camp. Or a honeymoon where people are going snorkeling through Miami Beach. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change There are whole imaginative theaters for storytelling about climate that we haven\u2019t yet begun to explore. But if all that is considered \u201cresponsible\u201d is optimistic hopeful storytelling about how we can solve the problem, then that\u2019s just\u2014from a narrative perspective, it\u2019s kind of corny. The best climate storytelling is likely to be written by people like J. G. Ballard, or William Gibson, or Margaret Atwood, who are really thinking about all the weird ways that these forces could transform our lives. Meyer: Gibson\u2019s really recent novel, The Peripheral , seems like one of the better presentations of how you\u2019re talking about history now\u2014about how day-to-day, lived existence would feel like in a world where progress has gone wrong, where there are cataclysms in the past from which people really haven\u2019t recovered. Wallace-Wells: I know [Gibson] a little bit because I did the Paris Review interview with him . We were emailing a few weeks ago and I was like, Oh, I\u2019m just adding a couple sentences to the book, last minute, about how science-fiction writers are likely to be understood even more as prophets because of climate change , and he wrote back and he was like, You know what, every time people say that to me, I always say \u201cWe haven\u2019t successfully predicted anything! We got all of our predictions wrong. The only thing we\u2019ve gotten right is the mood. \u201d And I wrote back and I was like, No, the mood is a prediction! It\u2019s a really important prediction, and actually you guys got it extremely right . Meyer: What\u2019s the meaning of climate change to you? What\u2019s its larger import? Is it the stuff about history or is it something else? Wallace-Wells: My short-form answer is that I think that the 21st century will be dominated by climate change in the same way that, say, the end of the 20th century was dominated by financial capitalism, or the 19th century in the West was dominated by modernity or industry\u2014that this will be the meta-narrative of the coming decades, and there won\u2019t be an area of human life that is untouched by it. Often people talk about climate change as a global problem, which it obviously is, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really started to think about what that means all the way down to the level of individual life. My basic perspective is that everything about human life on this planet will be transformed by this force. Even if we end up at a kind of best-case outcome, I think the world will be dominated by these forces in the coming decades in ways that it\u2019s hard to imagine and we really haven\u2019t started to think hard enough about. I am a child of the 1990s. I\u2019m American. I grew up in New York. And in that way I am, you know, the product of the end of history. I felt that there were all these forces unfolding in the world around me\u2014and that while I had my skepticism about them, while I had my critiques about them, I did believe that they were carrying us forward into a better, more prosperous, more just world. I knew that that would not be an easy path, and I knew that we\u2019d have to fight to make sure that, for instance, market forces and globalization benefited more people rather than fewer. I knew that there were political fights to be had there. But in general I just intuited in a deep emotional way\u2014that I might not have even been willing to admit publicly, because I would have found it embarrassing\u2014that history did move forward and therefore my life was going to be an experience of witnessing progress. I feel very profoundly not that way anymore.","headline":"The 3 Big Things That People Misunderstand About Climate Change","article_name":583360.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/02\/david-wallace-wells-climate-change-interview\/583360\/","date_published":"2019-02-22 14:47:28","article_length":13076,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:16.677449","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/02\/david-wallace-wells-climate-change-interview\/583360\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cWe\u2019re a lot closer than we should be,\u201d one Stanford scientist warned. The year 2018 was not an easy one for planet Earth. Sure, wind and solar energy kept getting cheaper , and an electric car became America\u2019s best-selling luxury vehicle . But the most important metric of climatic health\u2014the amount of heat-trapping gas entering the atmosphere\u2014got suddenly and shockingly worse. In the United States, carbon emissions leapt back up , making their largest year-over-year increase since the end of the Great Recession. This matched the trend across the globe. According to two major  studies , greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide shot up in 2018\u2014accelerating like a \u201cspeeding freight train,\u201d as one scientist put it . U.S. emissions do remain 11 percent below their 2007 peak, but that is one of the few bright spots in the data. Global emissions are now higher than ever. And the 2018 statistics are all the more dismal because greenhouse-gas emissions had previously seemed to be slowing or even declining, both in the United States and around the world. Many economists expect carbon emissions to drop somewhat throughout the next few decades. But maybe they won\u2019t. If 2018 is any indication, meekly positive energy trends will not handily reduce emissions, even in developed economies like the United States. It raises a bleak question: Are we currently on the worst-case scenario for climate change? \u201cWe\u2019re actually a lot closer than we should be; I can say that with confidence,\u201d says Rob Jackson , an Earth scientist at Stanford and the chair of the Global Carbon Project, which leads the research tracking worldwide emissions levels. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report When climate scientists want to tell a story about the future of the planet, they use a set of four standard scenarios called \u201crepresentative concentration pathways,\u201d or RCPs. RCPs are ubiquitous in climate science, appearing in virtually any study that uses climate models to investigate the 21st century. They\u2019ve popped up in research about subjects as disparate as  southwestern mega-droughts, future immigration flows to Europe, and poor nighttime sleep quality. Each RCP is assigned a number that describes how the climate will fare in the year 2100. Generally, a higher RCP number describes a scarier fate: It means that humanity emitted more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during the 21st century, further warming the planet and acidifying the ocean. The best-case scenario is called RCP 2.6. The worst case is RCP 8.5. \u201cGod help us if 8.5 turns out to be the right scenario,\u201d Jackson told me. Under RCP 8.5, the world\u2019s average temperature would rise by 4.9 degrees Celsius, or nearly 9 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cThat\u2019s an inconceivable increase for global temperatures\u2014especially when we think about them being global average temperatures,\u201d he said. \u201cTemperatures will be even higher in the northern latitudes, and higher over land than over the ocean.\u201d This scenario could still be in the planet\u2019s future, according to Zeke Hausfather , an analyst and climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. Since 2005, total global greenhouse-gas emissions have most closely tracked the RCP 8.5 scenario , he says. \u201cThere may be good reasons to be skeptical of RCP 8.5\u2019s late-century values, but observations to-date don\u2019t really give us grounds to exclude it,\u201d he recently wrote . Even if we avoid RCP 8.5, the less dramatic possibilities still could lead to catastrophic warming. Jackson, the Stanford professor, warned that every emissions scenario that meets the Paris Agreement\u2019s 2-degree Celsius \u201cgoal\u201d assumes that humanity will soon develop technology to remove carbon directly from the atmosphere. Such technology has never existed at industrial scales. \u201cEven some [of the scenarios] for 3 degrees Celsius assume that at some point in the next 50 years, we will have large-scale industrial activities to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous game, I think. We\u2019re assuming that this thing we can\u2019t do today will somehow be possible and cheaper in the future. I believe in tech, but I don\u2019t believe in magic.\u201d Read: No ecosystem on Earth is safe from climate change Yet not all data suggest that we\u2019re doomed to RCP 8.5 or equivalent amounts of warming, Hausfather cautions. If you look only at pollution from fossil-fuel burning\u2014and not from land-use events like deforestation\u2014then humanity\u2019s recent record trends closer to RCP 4.5 . That\u2019s good news, but only by comparison: RCP 4.5 still forecasts that global temperatures will rise by 2.4 degrees Celsius , enough to kill off nearly every coral reef and soar past the 2-degree target set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change. There are a few reasons it\u2019s hard to say which RCP comes closest to our reality. First, most of the RCPs tell roughly the same story about global emissions until about 2025 or 2030. Second, the RCPs describe emissions across the entire sweep of the 21st century\u2014and the century mostly hasn\u2019t happened yet. Trying to pick the most likely RCP in 2018 is a bit like trying to predict the precise depth of late-night snowfall at 4:32 a.m. The RCP 8.5 scenario may also become less likely in years to come, even if major polluters like the United States, China, and India never pass muscular climate policy. RCP 8.5 says that the global coal industry will eventually become seven times bigger than it is today. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to claim that \u2026 that is a business-as-usual world,\u201d Hausfather says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possible world, but we also live in a world today where solar is increasingly cheaper than coal.\u201d That\u2019s part of the reason the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will soon expand its list of standard scenarios. Its next major synthesis report, due to be published in 2021, will replace RCPs with five \u201csocioeconomic pathways\u201d that allow for a broader range of futures. Jackson urged caution. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet what scenario we\u2019re on,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most climate scientists will tell you that we\u2019re below the 8.5 scenario. But every year that emissions increase like they have this year, it makes the 8.5 scenario more plausible.\u201d Jackson published his first academic paper in 1989, just a year after the NASA scientist James Hansen first warned Congress that global warming had begun in earnest. I asked whether he thought actual emissions would ever come close to RCP 8.5. \u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I used to think a lot of things were nuts that turned out not to be nuts.\u201d","headline":"Are We Living Through Climate Change\u2019s Worst-Case Scenario?","article_name":579700.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario\/579700\/","date_published":"2019-01-15 12:23:31","article_length":6517,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:17.913008","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario\/579700\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"An exhibition in Manhattan is the first step in a grand attempt to change the national conversation around global warming. Since January 25, after sunset, the shades on a window-walled gallery in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village have rolled up, and the sidewalk outside has been cast in a cool, blue glow. The color comes from a four-and-a-half-hour-long video of ice cores. Inside the gallery, scanned images of samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet are on a continuous loop, representing 110,000 years of accumulation. Watching the footage gives the impression of descending through the ice core and into the past. The video, 88 Cores , is a new work by the Los Angeles artist Peggy Weil. It\u2019s accompanied by a selection of Weil\u2019s still images of ice-core samples from the National Ice Core Lab in Lakewood, Colorado. Like rings on a tree, the samples have slightly curved bands\u2014the mummification of eons of dust, debris, ash, and moisture. An ambient score by the composer Celia Hollander matches the feeling of the descent in the video with a \u201cdownward sloping glissando drone,\u201d as the gallery\u2019s wall text describes it. The exhibition is the inaugural show of the country\u2019s first climate museum. Housed at the Parsons School of Design, the museum\u2014for now\u2014only consists of the gallery on the corner of 13th Street and Fifth Avenue. After garnering a lot of attention when its founding director Miranda Massie announced the museum\u2019s incorporation in 2015, its first public offering has opened with little fanfare. This is in part because Massie is testing the potential audience for the museum, but also because she\u2019s experimenting with the delicate balance of its content. When she was introduced to Weil through a friend and saw images of 88 Cores , she thought it would not only complement the airy confines of the Parsons gallery, but would also, more importantly, affect people emotionally. \u201cHockey stick\u201d graphs have their place, but won\u2019t move the masses to create a \u201cclimate citizenship,\u201d says Massie. \u201c 88 Cores is a deep dive into one of the aspects of climate change that makes it so hard to grapple with, which is its immense scale. There\u2019s something about trying to encompass the long, deep arc of climate\u2019s time, of Earth\u2019s time, that makes you more aware of the need to act with urgency in this moment.\u201d Weil, for her part, considers her work as portraiture\u2014\u201ca collective human selfie.\u201d She wants people to see themselves in relationship to our imperiled, vulnerable landscape. The view matches Massie\u2019s grand ambitions. While activists, scientists, and divestment movements all have roles to play in scaling back carbon emissions, Massie says, she wants her museum to help push climate change into Americans\u2019 everyday conversations. Since Massie founded the museum, she has created a 501(c)(3) and amassed a board and list of advisers. A former civil-rights lawyer, she was driven to start the museum after Hurricane Sandy catalyzed her sense of urgency around climate change. Her goal\u2014years off\u2014is a permanent home for the museum in New York that inspires duplicates. \u201cWe want a climate museum in every major city,\u201d she says. But before that can happen, the museum\u2019s \u201cproof of concept\u201d will need to be tested with temporary exhibitions in borrowed and public spaces. When I met Massie in the Parsons gallery before a celebration for the opening of 88 Cores in late January, I barely recognized her. In photographs online, her brown hair is styled in a conservative bob, a cut suited to her previous life as civil-rights litigator. But the woman who greeted me had a pearlescent pixie cut\u2014part Daenerys Targaryen, part climate crusader. I realized halfway through our conversation that her crisp, black blazer was actually part cape, with dramatic slits down the arms. As Massie and I sat on a bench in the gallery, a steady stream of people wandered in to the free exhibition to see Weil\u2019s work. They also explored the hall next to the gallery, where artifacts and media offer more context on ice-core science and the Arctic. \u201cOne of the things we discovered is that both among really climate-literate people and the general public there is so much hunger for this information,\u201d said Massie, who retains a lawyer\u2019s delivery: practiced, attuned to narrative, rapid. \u201cThe central audience is people who are concerned, lack confidence about scientific details, and could be more engaged by a social, physical, and emotional experience.\u201d According to 2016 data released by the Yale Program on Climate-Change Communication, most American adults believe climate change is happening, but many don\u2019t believe it will affect them, and a majority of those surveyed never discuss it. Massie sees a museum\u2014an institution that is trusted and confers legitimacy\u2014as a way to open the floodgates of fear-based denial. Museums have long served as vehicles for social and political engagement, if not outright change. In a recent example, after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering the United States, the Museum of Modern Art, in New York, swiftly moved around its permanent collection to highlight works made by artists from the banned countries. Massie says she looks to two museums in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, as precedents for the Climate Museum\u2014institutions that reference history and suggest the work isn\u2019t over. But how can a vast and unwieldy subject such as climate change be expressed in architecture and exhibitions? James Stewart Polshek, a New York architect and member of the museum\u2019s board, says it\u2019s still premature to speculate about the details of the full museum\u2019s design or who would design it (the museum\u2019s website features gestural sketches by the Icelandic-Danish installation artist Olafur Eliasson, which gives one a sense of the institution\u2019s ambitions). \u201cIs the museum even an it ?\u201d Polshek mused, positing that the museum could exist virtually or be dispersed. \u201cI\u2019ve been an architect for a very long time, and finding ways to bring important ideas to attention is a lot more than bricks and mortar.\u201d Still, the museum is ever so tentatively beginning to think about what a permanent home could be. Massie has retained the architecture consultant Reed Kroloff to organize a kind of ideas competition in the fall\u2014one that won\u2019t result in a chosen architect or design, but will draw out possible forms for a climate museum from architects on all seven continents. A climate museum in Louisiana may look very different from one in Manhattan, for example. The former may be on stilts. The Climate Museum isn\u2019t the first or only institution to feature the work of artists who grapple with global warming or humans\u2019 toll on the planet. And it remains to be seen whether or not the museum can propel itself into a purpose-built home and then build an audience passionate enough to take its message back to homes, schools, and communities. Still, Timothy Morton, an ecology philosopher (and Bj\u00f6rk pen pal ) who has long believed that apocalyptic hand-wringing won\u2019t get us anywhere, thinks a climate museum is a good idea. \u201cAnything we can do to help people live this stuff, rather than just rubberneck the headlines, would be so great,\u201d he says. The night that I met Massie at the gallery, the museum had put out cards that asked visitors to reflect on their experience. \u201cNever has this made more sense than now,\u201d wrote someone who identified themselves as a Hurricane Irma survivor. On another wall, Polaroids of people at various museum events included their thoughts on why a climate-change museum was needed.

{"id":null,"body":"Why it feels like everything is going haywire Suppose that the biblical story of Creation were true: God created the universe in six days, including all the laws of physics and all the physical constants that apply throughout the universe. Now imagine that one day, in the early 21st century, God became bored and, just for fun, doubled the gravitational constant. What would it be like to live through such a change? We\u2019d all be pulled toward the floor; many buildings would collapse; birds would fall from the sky; the Earth would move closer to the sun, reestablishing orbit in a far hotter zone. Let\u2019s rerun this thought experiment in the social and political world, rather than the physical one. The U.S. Constitution was an exercise in intelligent design. The Founding Fathers knew that most previous democracies had been unstable and short-lived. But they were excellent psychologists, and they strove to create institutions and procedures that would work with human nature to resist the forces that had torn apart so many other attempts at self-governance. For example, in \u201c Federalist No. 10 ,\u201d James Madison wrote about his fear of the power of \u201cfaction,\u201d by which he meant strong partisanship or group interest that \u201cinflamed [men] with mutual animosity\u201d and made them forget about the common good. He thought that the vastness of the United States might offer some protection from the ravages of factionalism, because it would be hard for anyone to spread outrage over such a large distance. Madison presumed that factious or divisive leaders \u201cmay kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.\u201d The Constitution included mechanisms to slow things down, let passions cool, and encourage reflection and deliberation. Madison\u2019s design has proved durable. But what would happen to American democracy if, one day in the early 21st century, a technology appeared that\u2014over the course of a decade\u2014changed several fundamental parameters of social and political life? What if this technology greatly increased the amount of \u201cmutual animosity\u201d and the speed at which outrage spread? Might we witness the political equivalent of buildings collapsing, birds falling from the sky, and the Earth moving closer to the sun? America may be going through such a time right now. Facebook\u2019s early mission was \u201cto make the world more open and connected\u201d\u2014and in the first days of social media, many people assumed that a huge global increase in connectivity would be good for democracy. As social media has aged, however, optimism has faded and the list of known or suspected harms has grown: Online political discussions (often among anonymous strangers) are experienced as angrier and less civil than those in real life; networks of partisans co-create worldviews that can become more and more extreme; disinformation campaigns flourish; violent ideologies lure recruits. The problem may not be connectivity itself but rather the way social media turns so much communication into a public performance. We often think of communication as a two-way street. Intimacy builds as partners take turns, laugh at each other\u2019s jokes, and make reciprocal disclosures. What happens, though, when grandstands are erected along both sides of that street and then filled with friends, acquaintances, rivals, and strangers, all passing judgment and offering commentary? The social psychologist Mark Leary coined the term sociometer to describe the inner mental gauge that tells us, moment by moment, how we\u2019re doing in the eyes of others. We don\u2019t really need self -esteem, Leary argued ; rather, the evolutionary imperative is to get others to see us as desirable partners for various kinds of relationships. Social media, with its displays of likes, friends, followers, and retweets, has pulled our sociometers out of our private thoughts and posted them for all to see. If you constantly express anger in your private conversations, your friends will likely find you tiresome, but when there\u2019s an audience, the payoffs are different\u2014outrage can boost your status. A 2017 study by William J. Brady and other researchers at NYU measured the reach of half a million tweets and found that each moral or emotional word used in a tweet increased its virality by 20 percent, on average. Another 2017 study, by the Pew Research Center, showed that posts exhibiting \u201cindignant disagreement\u201d received nearly twice as much engagement \u2014including likes and shares\u2014as other types of content on Facebook. The philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke have proposed the useful phrase moral grandstanding to describe what happens when people use moral talk to enhance their prestige in a public forum. Like a succession of orators speaking to a skeptical audience, each person strives to outdo previous speakers, leading to some common patterns. Grandstanders tend to \u201ctrump up moral charges, pile on in cases of public shaming, announce that anyone who disagrees with them is obviously wrong, or exaggerate emotional displays.\u201d Nuance and truth are casualties in this competition to gain the approval of the audience. Grandstanders scrutinize every word spoken by their opponents\u2014and sometimes even their friends\u2014for the potential to evoke public outrage. Context collapses. The speaker\u2019s intent is ignored. Human beings evolved to gossip, preen, manipulate, and ostracize. We are easily lured into this new gladiatorial circus, even when we know that it can make us cruel and shallow. As the Yale psychologist Molly Crockett has argued , the normal forces that might stop us from joining an outrage mob\u2014such as time to reflect and cool off, or feelings of empathy for a person being humiliated\u2014are attenuated when we can\u2019t see the person\u2019s face, and when we are asked, many times a day, to take a side by publicly \u201cliking\u201d the condemnation. From October 2018: America is living James Madison\u2019s nightmare In other words, social media turns many of our most politically engaged citizens into Madison\u2019s nightmare: arsonists who compete to create the most inflammatory posts and images, which they can distribute across the country in an instant while their public sociometer displays how far their creations have traveled. At its inception, social media felt very different than it does today. Friendster, Myspace, and Facebook all appeared between 2002 and 2004, offering tools that helped users connect with friends. The sites encouraged people to post highly curated versions of their lives, but they offered no way to spark contagious outrage. This changed with a series of small steps, designed to improve user experience, that collectively altered the way news and anger spread through American society. In order to fix social media\u2014and reduce its harm to democracy\u2014we must try to understand this evolution. When Twitter arrived in 2006, its primary innovation was the timeline: a constant stream of 140-character updates that users could view on their phone. The timeline was a new way of consuming information\u2014an unending stream of content that, to many, felt like drinking from a fire hose. Later that year, Facebook launched its own version, called the News Feed. In 2009, it added the \u201cLike\u201d button, for the first time creating a public metric for the popularity of content. Then it added another transformative innovation: an algorithm that determined which posts a user would see, based on predicted \u201cengagement\u201d\u2014the likelihood of an individual interacting with a given post, figuring in the user\u2019s previous likes. This innovation tamed the fire hose, turning it into a curated stream. The News Feed\u2019s algorithmic ordering of content flattened the hierarchy of credibility. Any post by any producer could stick to the top of our feeds as long as it generated engagement. \u201cFake news\u201d would later flourish in this environment, as a personal blog post was given the same look and feel as a story from The New York Times . Twitter also made a key change in 2009, adding the \u201cRetweet\u201d button. Until then, users had to copy and paste older tweets into their status updates, a small obstacle that required a few seconds of thought and attention. The Retweet button essentially enabled the frictionless spread of content. A single click could pass someone else\u2019s tweet on to all of your followers\u2014and let you share in the credit for contagious content. In 2012, Facebook offered its own version of the retweet, the \u201cShare\u201d button, to its fastest-growing audience: smartphone users. Chris Wetherell was one of the engineers who created the Retweet button for Twitter. He admitted to BuzzFeed earlier this year that he now regrets it . As Wetherell watched the first Twitter mobs use his new tool, he thought to himself: \u201cWe might have just handed a 4-year-old a loaded weapon.\u201d Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. The coup de gr\u00e2ce came in 2012 and 2013, when Upworthy and other sites began to capitalize on this new feature set, pioneering the art of testing headlines across dozens of variations to find the version that generated the highest click-through rate. This was the beginning of \u201cYou won\u2019t believe \u2026\u201d articles and their ilk, paired with images tested and selected to make us click impulsively. These articles were not usually intended to cause outrage (the founders of Upworthy were more interested in uplift). But the strategy\u2019s success ensured the spread of headline testing, and with it emotional story-packaging, through new and old media alike; outrageous, morally freighted headlines proliferated in the following years. In Esquire , Luke O\u2019Neil reflected on the changes wrought on mainstream media and declared 2013 to be \u201cThe Year We Broke the Internet.\u201d The next year, Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency began mobilizing its network of fake accounts, across every major social-media platform\u2014exploiting the new outrage machine in order to inflame partisan divisions and advance Russian goals. The internet, of course, does not bear sole responsibility for the pitch of political anger today. The media have been fomenting division since Madison\u2019s time, and political scientists have traced a portion of today\u2019s outrage culture to the rise of cable television and talk radio in the 1980s and \u201990s. A multiplicity of forces are pushing America toward greater polarization. But social media in the years since 2013 has become a powerful accelerant for anyone who wants to start a fire. Even if social media could be cured of its outrage-enhancing effects, it would still raise problems for the stability of democracy. One such problem is the degree to which the ideas and conflicts of the present moment dominate and displace older ideas and the lessons of the past. As children grow up in America, rivers of information flow continually into their eyes and ears\u2014a mix of ideas, narratives, songs, images, and more. Suppose we could capture and quantify three streams in particular: information that is new (created within the past month), middle-aged (created 10 to 50 years ago, by the generations that include the child\u2019s parents and grandparents), and old (created more than 100 years ago). Whatever the balance of these categories was in the 18th century, the balance in the 20th century surely shifted toward the new as radios and television sets became common in American homes. And that shift almost certainly became still more pronounced, and quickly so, in the 21st century. When the majority of Americans began using social media regularly, around 2012, they hyper-connected themselves to one another in a way that massively increased their consumption of new information\u2014entertainment such as cat videos and celebrity gossip, yes, but also daily or hourly political outrages and hot takes on current events\u2014while reducing the share of older information. What might the effect of that shift be? In 1790, the Anglo-Irish philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke wrote, \u201cWe are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.\u201d Thanks to social media, we are embarking on a global experiment that will test whether Burke\u2019s fear is valid. Social media pushes people of all ages toward a focus on the scandal, joke, or conflict of the day, but the effect may be particularly profound for younger generations, who have had less opportunity to acquire older ideas and information before plugging themselves into the social-media stream. Our cultural ancestors were probably no wiser than us, on average, but the ideas we inherit from them have undergone a filtration process. We mostly learn of ideas that a succession of generations thought were worth passing on. That doesn\u2019t mean these ideas are always right, but it does mean that they are more likely to be valuable, in the long run, than most content generated within the past month. Even though they have unprecedented access to all that has ever been written and digitized, members of Gen Z (those born after 1995 or so) may find themselves less familiar with the accumulated wisdom of humanity than any recent generation, and therefore more prone to embrace ideas that bring social prestige within their immediate network yet are ultimately misguided. For example, a few right-wing social-media platforms have enabled the most reviled ideology of the 20th century to draw in young men hungry for a sense of meaning and belonging and willing to give Nazism a second chance. Left-leaning young adults, in contrast, seem to be embracing socialism and even, in some cases, communism with an enthusiasm that at times seems detached from the history of the 20th century. And polling suggests that young people across the political spectrum are losing faith in democracy. Social media has changed the lives of millions of Americans with a suddenness and force that few expected. The question is whether those changes might invalidate assumptions made by Madison and the other Founders as they designed a system of self-governance. Compared with Americans in the 18th century\u2014and even the late 20th century\u2014citizens are now more connected to one another, in ways that increase public performance and foster moral grandstanding, on platforms that have been designed to make outrage contagious, all while focusing people\u2019s minds on immediate conflicts and untested ideas, untethered from traditions, knowledge, and values that previously exerted a stabilizing effect. This, we believe, is why many Americans\u2014and citizens of many other countries, too\u2014experience democracy as a place where everything is going haywire. There was a time in American public life when atonement was seen as a form of strength\u2014a way not only to own up to one\u2019s missteps but also to control the narrative. That time is over, Megan Garber writes. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Social media is not intrinsically bad, and has the power to do good\u2014as when it brings to light previously hidden harms and gives voice to previously powerless communities. Every new communication technology brings a range of constructive and destructive effects, and over time, ways are found to improve the balance. Many researchers, legislators, charitable foundations, and tech-industry insiders are now working together in search of such improvements. We suggest three types of reform that might help: (1) Reduce the frequency and intensity of public performance.  If social media creates incentives for moral grandstanding rather than authentic communication, then we should look for ways to reduce those incentives. One such approach already being evaluated by some platforms is \u201cdemetrication,\u201d the process of obscuring like and share counts so that individual pieces of content can be evaluated on their own merit, and so that social-media users are not subject to continual, public popularity contests. (2) Reduce the reach of unverified accounts.  Bad actors\u2014trolls, foreign agents, and domestic provocateurs\u2014benefit the most from the current system, where anyone can create hundreds of fake accounts and use them to manipulate millions of people. Social media would immediately become far less toxic, and democracies less hackable, if the major platforms required basic identity verification before anyone could open an account\u2014or at least an account type that allowed the owner to reach large audiences. (Posting itself could remain anonymous, and registration would need to be done in a way that protected the information of users who live in countries where the government might punish dissent. For example, verification could be done in collaboration with an independent nonprofit organization.) (3) Reduce the contagiousness of low-quality information.  Social media has become more toxic as friction has been removed. Adding some friction back in has been shown to improve the quality of content. For example, just after a user submits a comment, AI can identify text that\u2019s similar to comments previously flagged as toxic and ask, \u201cAre you sure you want to post this?\u201d This extra step has been shown to help Instagram users rethink hurtful messages. The quality of information that is spread by recommendation algorithms could likewise be improved by giving groups of experts the ability to audit the algorithms for harms and biases. Many Americans may think that the chaos of our time has been caused by the current occupant of the White House, and that things will return to normal whenever he leaves. But if our analysis is correct, this will not happen. Too many fundamental parameters of social life have changed. The effects of these changes were apparent by 2014, and these changes themselves facilitated the election of Donald Trump. If we want our democracy to succeed\u2014indeed, if we want the idea of democracy to regain respect in an age when dissatisfaction with democracies is rising\u2014we\u2019ll need to understand the many ways in which today\u2019s social-media platforms create conditions that may be hostile to democracy\u2019s success. And then we\u2019ll have to take decisive action to improve social media.

{"id":null,"body":"The island was once a place of working-class ingenuity and Black daring. I caught the fast ferry from Hyannis to Nantucket, 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. As the boat plowed the waves, I was taken aback by my first view of the island. I could see it all at once, end to end, 14 miles of isolated terra, dwarfed by the sea and sky. Once we reached the wharf and I joined the carefree crowds of summer tourists, I tried to forget that picture of exposure. But those who live on Nantucket and care about its past and future know that the climate is changing, the sea is rising, and the island has never been more vulnerable. \u201cWe are a pile of sand out here,\u201d Marsha L. Fader, an architect and a preservation specialist, told me. We were standing on a grassy green, shaded by trees in their full June glory, in an area known as Five Corners. Back in the late 1700s and the 1800s, it was part of a neighborhood called New Guinea, a name reflective of its ethnic origins. Two buildings remain from that time: a house built by a Black man, Seneca Boston, who had been enslaved on the island in the mid-1700s, and the African Meeting House, which also served as a church and school. These structures constitute some of the oldest Black landmarks in America. Florence Higginbotham, a Black cook and domestic worker, purchased the Boston house in 1920, and the Meeting House 13 years later. No one knows for sure why she bought the buildings, but we owe their continued existence to her. After she died, the Meeting House fell into disrepair. In 1986, a headline in Nantucket\u2019s Inquirer and Mirror read: \u201cHistoric Black Church on York Street Awaits Restoration\u2013Or Collapse.\u201d A few years later, Higginbotham\u2019s son sold the African Meeting House to the Museum of African American History, headquartered in Boston. But even the museum struggled to pay for the upkeep. In an appeal for support in the \u201990s, the major threats to the African Meeting House were identified as \u201cneglect,\u201d \u201cdeterioration,\u201d and \u201cinsufficient funding.\u201d Some islanders saw the building as an eyesore, asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tear it down?\u201d Supporters of the effort pressed on. Today, the Meeting House stands restored, and the Boston-Higginbotham House, also acquired by the museum, will soon be open to the public. The humble structures meld with the gray-shingled streetscape so tidily that one would hardly know they represent a significant chapter of African American history, marking the spot where hundreds of Black people, alongside their Native American kin, once made Nantucket their own. Picture Nantucket, and you probably imagine whales and hydrangeas, white people swimming in white-capped waves. But that\u2019s only part of the story. Although the Black community of New Guinea has passed into history, its mark on the landscape remains, a reminder that Nantucket was once a place of working-class ingenuity and Black daring. T his was my first visit to Nantucket. But the place was no stranger to my imagination. When I was a midwestern fifth-grader in the 1980s, I became obsessed with The Official Preppy Handbook , a cheeky guide to the WASP lifestyle. My mother and I lived in a leaky, lemon-yellow rowhouse that my family had bought from the city of Cincinnati for a dollar. The house stood on a street that was mostly Black and a little bit poor white. On weekends, while my mother was closeted in her bedroom studying for her part-time junior-college courses, I snuck into vacant houses where I could unearth abandoned objects, read Trixie Belden mysteries, and comb through the Handbook . Some Fridays, a friend from school who sketched perfect, feather-maned horses and was also fascinated by preppy culture slept over. We would eat cereal and think up stories about barely disguised autobiographical characters named Buffy and Muffy. I am Black and my friend is white, but we were both the only children of financially strapped single mothers. We attended Clifton Elementary in an upstanding white neighborhood full of stay-at-home moms and mansions. My friend lived in a small apartment on the border of that neighborhood. I lived a fair distance away, but my mother had kept a sharp eye on the school since my toddler years and, thanks to some mix-up with the application paperwork and home addresses, facilitated by the fact that my father and stepmother lived (arguably) near the school, I wound up there too. We were surrounded by girls who were the real prep deal. They collected grosgrain ribbons, wore tennis dresses with miniature animals on the heart, and belonged to private swim clubs that didn\u2019t let Black people in. It was from these girls\u2019 Handbook that I learned that summer is a verb and Nantucket is an island. When I finally saw the place in person, I found it to be lovely and bustling, its buildings charming and historic, an effect crafted by savvy residents who realized that preserving the island\u2019s 18th- and 19th-century look would be a lure for tourists. Cobblestone streets overflowed with visitors, including a smattering of people of color dressed, like everyone else, in florals and summer whites. There was a difference between these tourists already sporting Nantucket sweatshirts and the regular summer inhabitants who own second homes. The summer people appeared drenched in a caliber of wealth so beyond my personal experience that I could not begin to classify its features and gradations. I could, however, identify \u201cNantucket red,\u201d that ruddy shade of sailboat-chic clothing, as well as the train of Jeeps too large for the antique roads, both of which I had read about in The Official Preppy Handbook . The service workers and Jacks- and Jills-of-all-trades whose labor keeps the dreamlike summer industry afloat never appeared in that book, but they are everywhere on Nantucket: unloading ferries, driving taxis, serving in restaurants, repairing shingles, and scrubbing short-term rentals. In the quaint inn where I stayed, the other guests were all white, and every person cleaning a room was a Black woman with a Caribbean accent. Surely this glimpse of life on the island is incomplete. Almost 20,000 people live on Nantucket year-round, and they still include working- and middle-class people whose families have been there for generations. An exhibit at the public library, made up of scenes embroidered by members of the community, includes this stitched line: \u201cMy home is not a lifestyle brand.\u201d Still, the impression of Nantucket as a place where the comforts of wealthy white summer residents are supplied by low-wage Black workers carries echoes of the class stratification, indentured servitude, and slavery that gave rise to New Guinea in the 1700s. W hen I asked L\u2019Merchie Frazier, the director of education and interpretation at the Museum of African American History, to tell me about New Guinea, she began with what she called \u201cthe discovery quote unquote\u201d of Nantucket by English settlers. This is the bus-tour version of Nantucket history; one of the most popular anecdotes involves a group of Englishmen atop a hill in 1690, surveying the sandy land, an abundance of whales breaching in the distance. The settlers and Native Americans supposedly got along and traded knowledge, until Nantucket boomed into a wealthy seaside mecca known for its abolitionist, Quaker values. As Frazier pointed out, there are some gaps in this story. Nantucket comes from an Indigenous word for \u201cisland.\u201d Nantucket was not discovered by Anglo-Americans, many of whom arrived from the mainland north of Boston, because Native Americans were already there\u20141,500 to 3,000 members of the Wampanoag people, dispersed across multiple villages. They sustained themselves by hunting birds, gathering shellfish and wild plants, and occasionally harvesting the body parts of dead or stranded whales. After the English arrived, ushering in pathogens and poverty, the Wampanoag population shrank to just 800 people. Settlers let their sheep encroach on the fields where the Indigenous islanders grew corn. The English ordered the killing of the dogs the Wampanoags used to hunt waterfowl, because they interfered with those same sheep. Pushed onto smaller parcels of land, hindered in their ability to feed themselves, and cornered into crushing debt, many Native Nantucketers, children included, were forced into indentured servitude. Meanwhile Anglo-Nantucketers became wealthy, particularly through the commercial whaling industry\u2014first hunting right whales, then sperm whales. They did not do this alone. They needed labor from populations with ready skills that would not, or could not, reject dangerous maritime work. And so, like most of colonial America, Nantucket\u2019s English settlers turned to slavery. They compelled Indigenous people to row their boats and brought Africans \u201cskilled in the arts of weaving, milling, building, and other pursuits\u201d to the island, Frazier said. The first English landowners were independently minded Christians, mostly of Baptist and Congregationalist leanings. In the 1700s, many of their descendants adopted the Quaker faith. Quakerism and whaling created a distinctive set of values: intense commercialism combined with embryonic humanitarianism and global cosmopolitanism. By 1775, the bone and oil harvested from the bodies of whales had made Nantucket the most lucrative whaling port not just in New England, but in the entire world. In the 19th century, many white and free Black Nantucketers became famously staunch abolitionists\u2014in 1841, Frederick Douglass gave his first speech to a mostly white audience on the island. However, the century and a half before that was a time of dispossession and enslavement. In 1764, a Nantucket census counted 3,570 residents, including 148 \u201cIndians + Sqwaws\u201d \u00a0and 50 \u201cNegroes,\u201d many of whom were enslaved. O ne Black family, the Bostons, lived on Nantucket for generations and profoundly shaped the island\u2019s history. Boston and his wife, Maria, and their eight children were enslaved by a merchant named William Swain. In 1760, for reasons that are not documented, Swain freed the couple and their youngest baby. He placed the other children on a manumission schedule, guaranteeing that he could extract their labor for years. Eventually, members of the Boston family moved to a hilly region at the edge of town, where a handful of other free Black families lived, near the four noisy windmills that served as the island\u2019s power source. It was, according to the local historian Frances Karttunen, \u201ca liminal area \u2026 a place for people to regroup.\u201d A freed weaver named Africa may have been the first to purchase land in the vicinity, in 1723. In 1773 Nantucket began to phase out slavery, and many emancipated residents migrated to the settlement. They welcomed Wampanoags from nearby Miacomet, which had been decimated by disease. Intermarriages followed between Black and Native people from Nantucket, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and Cape Cod, turning the village that was now known as New Guinea (and sometimes as Newtown) into a multicultural hub. One of Maria and Boston\u2019s sons, Seneca, a weaver, married Thankful Micah, a Wampanoag survivor. They built the house that still stands on the lot near Five Corners today, one of the oldest existing Black-built homes in the United States. The couple named their first child, a son, Freeborn. A younger son, Absalom, became the first Black man to captain a ship, the Industry, out of Nantucket\u2019s waters, with an all-Black crew. By 1850 New Guinea was home to two churches, a school, several shops, a dance hall, and an anti-slavery lending library. White residents lived alongside Black families who had escaped southern enslavement and found a relatively secure hideaway on the remote island. New Guinea was, in the words of the historian Nathaniel Philbrick, an \u201cexemplary community\u201d where people of color \u201coperated in a microcosm of extraordinary diversity that was knit together by family bonds.\u201d But during the same decades that Nantucket became a hub of abolitionist activity, the island also saw an increase in anti-Black prejudice. Many New Guinea residents left the island as the whaling industry began to collapse due, in part, to the petroleum boom. Eventually the settlement became home to new communities of African descent: African Americans who came to Nantucket as domestic servants and stayed, along with Cape Verdean and Caribbean immigrants who worked in the island\u2019s developing agricultural and tourism industries. In the 1960s, gentrification began pushing the Black and working-class population out of historic New Guinea. Summer residents sought homes in what had become a desirable area. I can\u2019t help wondering if Florence Higginbotham, when she purchased the town\u2019s most famous buildings, preserving them for future generations, had an inkling that this was coming. Today New Guinea is full of multimillion-dollar homes built on lots that have passed out of Black, Native, and working-class hands. N ow the property faces a new threat: Along with the entire island, historic New Guinea must contend with the upheaval of climate change . Nantucket is developing a coastal-resilience plan, slated for completion by this fall. A team of experts, officials, and residents are assessing every coastal area of the island for its community significance and physical vulnerability. The resulting blueprint will guide decision making about what should be prioritized for protection against sea-level rise, flooding, and erosion. The African Meeting House and the Boston-Higginbotham House will not be prioritized, for an understandable reason: Though they\u2019re less than half a mile from the water, they sit on a hill, so are not directly threatened by sea-level rise. But storms are worsening and flooding is becoming more common everywhere on Nantucket. The island geography that once gave New Guinea the freedom to flourish is precisely what now makes the area so vulnerable to climate change. This pattern holds true for other sites of Black history. Early America\u2019s Eastern Seaboard was a slaving landscape. In spots at the margins in the North, Africans and their descendants who managed to attain freedom, or were among the lucky minority born free, could sometimes form semi-safe, semi-stable communities. New Guinea is a prime example, as is Little Liberia in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which thrived in the mid-19th century. In the South, the Gullah Geechee Cultural Corridor of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida was a differently distinctive place. Enslaved coastal and sea-island residents were able to retain and adapt cultural practices from Africa because their enslavers rarely visited the humid and disease-infested plantations. Remoteness\u2014clinging to coastlines or perched on islands\u2014made these communities possible. In recent years, preservationists have begun to focus on how to protect coastal sites like these. A series of conferences titled \u201cKeeping History Above Water\u201d launched in Newport, Rhode Island, and came to Nantucket in 2019 with the support of the Nantucket Preservation Trust. \u201cPeople are sometimes surprised to find that a historic preservation group is so interested in climate change,\u201d Mary Bergman, the trust\u2019s executive director, told me over email. But no one can ignore it \u201cwhen there is water in the streets winter after winter and houses sliding into the sea from more frequent and powerful storms.\u201d Skeptical of the efficacy of mitigation strategies, Fader, the architect, thinks that eventually most threatened sites will just have to \u201cmove to higher ground.\u201d She saw this tactic work in the late 1970s, when she was involved with a National Park Service project to relocate by barge a 19th-century maritime-rescue station from one part of Cape Cod to another to protect it from shoreline erosion. She described a futuristic scene in which the ocean would carry \u201cbarges with all these historic houses on their way to somewhere else.\u201d Fortunately, historic New Guinea doesn\u2019t face this level of risk. But it is haunting to imagine any precious African American historic structure torn away from its origins and from the marginalized populations that stewarded it and were, in turn, sheltered by it. This is Bergman\u2019s fear for Codfish Park. Established around the turn of the 20th century\u00a0 on the eastern side of Nantucket in the area known as \u2019Sconset (from an Algonquian term meaning \u201cplace of great bones\u201d), Codfish Park was a low-lying fishing village. It was also, Bergman told me, a \u201cracially and ethnically diverse neighborhood, with African American, Cape Verdean, Bermudian, and Irish families \u2026 [who] worked as domestic workers, cooks, drivers, laundry workers, and performed other jobs for the vacationers \u2018above bank.\u2019\u201d In the 1990s, during a storm with no name, a few homes in Codfish Park slipped into the ocean. \u201cIt is a vulnerable, low-lying area with little separating it from the sea,\u201d Bergman said. \u201cIt is also a place that is important to Nantucket\u2019s Black history, and the history of working people on the island.\u201d Even without the complicating factor of climate change, places like Codfish Park and historic New Guinea can be doomed by simple inattention. \u201cThe traditional preservation movement has often neglected and undervalued Black historic sites,\u201d says Brent Leggs, the executive director of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund at the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the author of Preserving African American Historic Places . This is \u201cin part because they tend to be vernacular structures that do not personify beautiful architecture,\u201d or because \u201ctheir means of construction were not meant to last the test of time.\u201d As a result, he told me over email, \u201cthe historic imprint of Black people\u201d has disappeared from much of America. The fund has just received $20 million from the philanthropists MacKenzie Scott and Dan Jewett to preserve Black landmarks. While none of these initial funds are slated for Nantucket, a portion will go to nearby Martha\u2019s Vineyard for its African American Heritage Trail. (Martha\u2019s Vineyard shares with Nantucket a history of African enslavement and had its own famous Black whaling captain, but is most notable in the annals of Black history for becoming a vacation spot for middle- and upper-class African Americans in the early and mid-1900s.) Vince Murphy, who is overseeing the resilience plan for Nantucket, told me the government is aware of the complexities that issues of race and class add to its endeavor. He also pointed out a catch\u2014a \u201cparadox to equity on Nantucket\u201d that complicates this narrative. In most places, \u201cpoorer people are most affected by climate change.\u201d But Nantucket, where the rich spend millions on oceanfront property, is different. Property owners on the coasts generally \u201chave the means to adapt to these threats,\u201d he said, while \u201cregular people\u201d living inland would be \u201cless directly affected.\u201d Trevor Johnson, the lead consultant on the plan, was the first to articulate a question\u2014or, rather, a suspicion\u2014that this brought to the top of my mind: \u201cWith sea-level rise, do those formerly undesirable locations now become more desirable?\u201d Could that lead \u201cto further displacement of Black history and folks who have been disadvantaged?\u201d This, he said, is called \u201cclimate gentrification.\u201d In creating its coastal-resilience plan, Nantucket is facing a question that is being asked, or will soon be asked, of communities around the world, a question that goes to the core of what the historian David Glassberg calls \u201cheritage justice\u201d: Whose rights to home and history will be defended, and whose will be abandoned? Our country\u2019s track record does not inspire confidence that we will meet this challenge with honor. M aybe the Bostons and their neighbors showed us a way forward. When Black Nantucketers struck out to create their own community, they did not have their pick of the best places on the island. They settled near the windmills; welcomed others in need; and turned the area into a garden of social, political, and economic life. These early Nantucketers acted to improve their collective existence despite trauma and loss, and others acted years later to preserve what they had built. To Leggs, these \u201coverlooked stories of African American resilience, activism and achievement \u2026 are fundamental to the nation itself.\u201d New Guinea was a sanctuary village built in the wake of slavery. Its story captures an essence of Nantucket that is deeper than the stereotypical image of The Preppy Handbook and more inspiring than the legend of the Englishmen on the hill. Where better to ponder the possibilities for responding to the coming storms than on this communal high ground, still\u2014by concerted effort that seems a miracle\u2014under the stewardship of Black caretakers?","headline":"Nantucket Doesn\u2019t Belong to the Preppies","article_name":619874.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/08\/nantucket-doesnt-belong-to-the-preppies\/619874\/","date_published":"2021-08-30 11:00:00","article_length":20803,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:19.947178","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/08\/nantucket-doesnt-belong-to-the-preppies\/619874\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"Many Americans say global warming is real. But far fewer believe it\u2019s a pressing national priority. It\u2019s a well-documented paradox that the average American citizen believes climate change is a much bigger deal than the average American legislator does. That was the case in 1997 with Kyoto Protocol, which Congress refused to ratify despite public support for action. Today, as congressional Republicans grumble about the Paris climate talks,  two-thirds of Americans support joining an international treaty addressing carbon emissions. That disconnect disappears, however, when you ask the right question. Late last year, a comprehensive survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute showed that only 5 percent of Americans saw climate change as the country\u2019s No. 1 challenge. Most said jobs, income inequality, and health care were more important. \u201cClimate change is an incredibly difficult issue to get really fired up about\u2014its effects are so incremental and slow-moving, they\u2019re difficult to perceive,\u201d said Daniel Cox, PRRI\u2019s director of research. \u201cWith the environment and the economy, there\u2019s always a trade-off. And when people are are particularly economically distressed, support for environmental policy drops off.\u201d If President Obama is to succeed in convincing Congress to support his climate change agenda, he first needs to widen support for immediate action in the American public. To do that, he\u2019ll have to figure out who\u2019s already with him. So if the profile of climate change \u201ctrue believer\u201d is currently a well-educated, left-leaning, agnostic Generation X-er, who\u2019s next? Millennials. (Who else?) Given that generation\u2019s interest in green living, its relatively soft engagement on climate compared to older Americans continues to surprise, Cox said. But that may change soon, opening up a new, wide avenue of support. \u201cI think they\u2019re just not tuned in,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery younger generation goes through the same growing pains. You start off not being connected, but as you get older, you start paying attention to issues.\u201d Another area of growth could be within the ranks of the faithful. Climate change, unlike abortion or gay marriage, doesn\u2019t carry the baggage of the culture wars. And people who hear about global warming from the pulpit are more likely to call it a crisis, PRRI\u2019s research shows. But perplexingly, the biggest block to climate change bipartisanship may be \u2026 well, partisanship. Polls show that the line between Republican and Democrats has hardened, Cox said. Absent a prominent Republican staking a claim on addressing global warming, he\u2019s not sure how that\u2019ll change. In the end, it may be the biggest demographic hurdle of all.","headline":"Who Actually Makes Climate Change a Priority?","article_name":418992.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/the-small-minority-of-americans-who-worry-about-climate-change\/418992\/","date_published":"2015-12-07 11:07:00","article_length":2688,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:20.757391","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/the-small-minority-of-americans-who-worry-about-climate-change\/418992\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The Ohio governor suggests that action to fight global warming could kill jobs. Ohio Gov. John Kasich suggested that man-made climate change may not be real and that action to fight it could kill jobs during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \"We don't want to destroy people's jobs based on some theory that's not proven,\" Kasich said when asked by host Chuck Todd if he believes that climate change is man made and that man should do something about it. Kasich added that \"man absolutely affects the environment\" but said that he thinks that \"as to the overall impact of that, I think that's a legitimate debate.\" Despite a headline-grabbing performance in Thursday's Republican prime-time presidential debate, Kasich still faces an uphill battle to prove that he is a viable 2016 contender after nearly missing the polling cutoff to appear on the debate's main stage. Media attention could yield the publicity that the Ohio governor badly needs to bolster his standing in national polls, but the spotlight will also pressure the candidate to clarify his positions on a wide array of contentious issues, including climate change. The Kasich 2016 campaign sought to clarify the candidate's remarks following his appearance on Meet the Press , saying: \"The governor has long believed climate change is real and we need to so something about it. The debate over exact percentages of why it is happening is less important than what can be done about it. We know it is real, we know man has an impact, and we know we need to do something.\" Unlike many Republican presidential contenders, Kasich has expressed concern over climate change in the past. \"I am a believer \u2014 my goodness, I am a Republican \u2014 I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don't want to overreact to it, I can't measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us, and I want to make sure we protect it,\" Kasich said in 2012 . Comments like that have appeared to set Kasich apart from leading GOP 2016 contenders such as Ted Cruz, who has said that there has been no global warming in recent years. The Ohio governor has also been quick to tout efforts to cut emissions in his state and he praises clean energy. \"In my state of Ohio, we preciously take care of Lake Erie, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent over the last 10 years, we believe in alternative energy,\" Kasich said on Sunday. Some environmentalists have watched Kasich with interest, wondering if he might take a more moderate stand on the issue than some of his fellow Republicans. But Sunday's remarks suggest that Kasich may side with members of his party who say that any kind of overarching action to fight climate change would ultimately hurt the economy and kill jobs. The vast majority of scientists say that climate change is real, that it poses a threat to the Earth, and that it is driven primarily by human activities like the burning of fossil fuels.

{"id":null,"body":"How a warming world could affect rockfalls like Yosemite's Last Wednesday and Thursday, there were two major rockfall events at Yosemite\u2019s El Capitan, a rock formation extremely popular with climbers. Wednesday\u2019s rockslide killed one person, the first rockfall-related fatality in the park since 1999 . Thursday\u2019s released a volume of rock larger than 10,000 cubic meters, about four Olympic swimming pools\u2019 worth of rock. According to Roger Putnam, a climber and geologist at Moorpark College, these rockslides were not unusual from a geologic standpoint. In fact, he said, the quick succession of rockfalls \u201cperfectly shows how a small rockfall happens and then\u2014boom\u2014that causes another rockfall, and another.\u201d Rockfalls are par for the course at Yosemite, where the National Park Service estimates 80 events happen every year. But despite their frequency, there is a possibility that warming temperatures and an unstable climate could cause even more rockfalls at Yosemite and worldwide. Rockslides happen in rock with existing weaknesses, like large cracks, after they become unstable as a result of a trigger. Roy Sidle , a professor of geography at the University of the Sunshine Coast, said in an email that those triggers fall into four major categories: \u201cfreeze-thaw action, wetting and drying, temperature changes, and (of course) human disturbances (even rock climbing).\u201d Putnam said that, until recently, most geologists thought freeze-thaw cycles, also called frost wedging , caused the majority of rockfalls. The idea was that water seeped into cracks during winter rainstorms, then expanded when it froze\u2014the same process that forms potholes . Then, in 2016, Yosemite\u2019s park geologist published a paper in Nature Geoscience that found most rockslides in Yosemite happen on hot, sunny days, not in freezing temperatures. Like sticky wood doors in the summer, rock expands ever so slightly when it\u2019s heated. The more the temperature rises and falls between day and night, or summer and winter, the more rock will expand and then contract, causing cracks to propagate through it. As temperatures rise worldwide, those hot, sunny days will become more frequent, which could mean more rockslides. Rising global temperatures are also melting the glaciers and permafrost that support rock formations. According to Allen Glazner, a professor of geology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this kind of melting \u201chas really no effect on what\u2019s happening in Yosemite.\u201d But there are still glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, and they\u2019ve ben retreating for a century . In colder places like the Alps, melting glaciers and permafrost have been linked to an expected uptick in rockslides. Climate change could also impact the wetting and drying cycles that may trigger rockslides. According to Glazner, the sheer weight of water can sometimes be too much for a rock formation, and cause sections to break off. As hurricanes and other storms become less frequent and more intense , the water weight from large storms could also trigger more rockfalls. It\u2019s hard to tell what the cumulative effect of a changing climate will be on the frequency of rockslides. On the one hand, fewer freezing nights could reduce the number of rockslides caused by freeze-thaw cycles; on the other hand, a warmer and wetter climate could increase the number of slides caused by heat-based rock expansion and water weight. \u201cIt could be that the effects cancel out,\u201d said Glazner. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d All three geologists were careful to point out that there\u2019s no conclusive data yet to prove rockslides are getting more frequent in Yosemite. Sidle was cautious about predicting a rockfall-driven apocalypse in a warming Yosemite, but didn\u2019t rule out more rockfall activity. \u201cI would say the impact of climate change on rockslides in Yosemite is currently rather small, but could increase slightly with time if freeze-thaw and wetting-drying cycles become more common and diurnal temperature changes become greater,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this embodies several assumptions.\u201d As for preparing for rockslides to make them less dangerous, said Sidle, \u201cin real time, prediction is not really feasible.\u201d Efforts like a 3-D map of the rock types that make up El Capitan by Putnam and Glazner could help identify areas that are likely to erode, but according to Glazner, that study didn\u2019t point out the areas that fell last week as particularly vulnerable. Putnam said that, because smaller rockfalls often trigger larger slides, the NPS frequently issues warnings to park visitors when they observe smaller falls. But it\u2019s still very difficult to predict: \u201cEverything could have stopped on the 27th,\u201d he said, before the much larger rockslide on the 28th. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a tiny rockfall in Yosemite, you can\u2019t shut down every road,\u201d Putnam said, \u201cbecause then you wouldn\u2019t have a national park.\u201d Glazner similarly highlights the relationship between rockfalls and Yosemite\u2019s landscape. \u201cThese kinds of catastrophic events are why those beautiful cliffs are there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see big boulders on the valley floor, almost all of them fell off the cliff nearby. Nature always wins on this stuff.\u201d","headline":"Will Climate Change Make Rockslides Worse?","article_name":541659.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/and-the-mountains-should-crumble-to-the-sea\/541659\/","date_published":"2017-10-02 14:20:33","article_length":5193,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:21.876762","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/and-the-mountains-should-crumble-to-the-sea\/541659\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Unusually hot days have profound effects on mental health and human physiology. For almost two centuries now, scientists have noticed a place\u2019s suicide rate bears troubling links to the changing of the seasons and the friendliness of its climate. In 1881 , the Italian physician Enrico Morselli noted that suicide rates peak in the summer , deeming the effect \u201ctoo great for it to be attributed to chance of the human will.\u201d Two decades later, the French sociologist Emile Durkheim noticed the same effect\u2014though he also found the suicide rate was higher in Scandinavian countries . Even today, CDC data confirms that suicides peak in the United States in the early summer. Now, scientists have identified one more way that climate shapes suicide\u2014and, worryingly, they have projected that it will only become more pronounced as suicide rates rise in a rapidly warming world. Unusually hot days cause the suicide rate to rise, according to a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change . If a month is 1 degree Celsius warmer than normal, then its suicide rate will increase by 0.7 percent in the United States and 2.1 percent in Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a brutal finding,\u201d says Marshall Burke , a professor of earth science at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper. The finding has anxious implications for a world whose climate is rapidly changing. The authors project that roughly 14,000 people\u2014and as many as 26,000\u2014could die by suicide in the United States by 2050 if humanity does not reduce its emissions of greenhouse-gas pollution. This is roughly the same change in suicide rates as are driven by \u201cthe estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide-prevention programs, or gun-restriction laws.\u201d It also concludes that humans can do little about this suicide-climate link beyond developing better medical care to address suicide specifically. The normal ways that people adapt to high temperatures generally\u2014by installing air conditioners, for instance\u2014do not seem to affect the suicide rate. Suicide is the second most-common cause of death among Americans between 10 and 34 years of age. It is also one of the few leading causes of death in the United States where the age-adjusted mortality rate is not falling. In other words, more people are dying by suicide than used to. \u201cI found the results compelling and the methodology strong,\u201d says Gregory Tasian , a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania who was not related to the study. \u201cIt fits very well into the overall narrative about the effect of climate change and high temperatures on human health\u2014and it incorporates another aspect of human health which is often neglected, which is mental health,\u201d he told me. The new paper provides unusually robust evidence that high temperatures will significantly aggravate the problem of suicide. First, the new paper makes a causative claim: Unusually high temperatures really do seem to cause suicide rates to increase. The authors have controlled for every other major variable that might affect suicide rates. The effect doesn\u2019t seem to change if the victims are men or women, if the month is January or June, if they live in an American city or the Mexican countryside. Nor does it vary in areas where guns are plentiful. Second, it finds that the effect shows up everywhere : in Saint Paul and San Antonio, in Ohio and Oaxaca. \u201cWe see the exact same effect size in hot places versus cold places,\u201d Burke told me. Previous studies of climate change and mortality have found that global warming\u2019s effects on mortality will be mixed. In a landmark study last year , for instance, a team of economists found that warmer temperatures will grant modest economic benefits to the upper Midwest and New England, since they will blunt those regions\u2019 deadly winters. (The Sunbelt will suffer far worse costs during the summer, however.) Not so for the suicide rate, which will increase ubiquitously under global warming. \u201c\u2018Climate change is going to generate winners and losers\u2019\u2014this is a phrase you hear all the time,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBut for this outcome, it\u2019s all losers. There are no winners. We find these strong linear relationships everywhere when you crank up the temperature.\u201d Finally, the paper finds there are few ways to blunt this effect. In previous studies , economists have found that air-conditioning adoption causes heat-related mortality to decrease over time. But the climate-suicide link does not show the same pliability. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a mitigating effect of air-conditioner adoption on any of these effects,\u201d Burke said. \u201cEven once you control for income, you still don\u2019t see air-conditioner use come through as a factor. Suicide is a fundamentally different animal than these other types of mortality, like cardiac mortality, that you see in the literature.\u201d \u201cIf there is going to be adaptation in the future, it has to be unprecedented. It has to be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen over the past half century in the United States,\u201d he added. The new study doesn\u2019t address the underlying mechanism beneath this climate-suicide relationship, though the authors report that certain neurotransmitters, including serotonin, are also used to regulate the body\u2019s temperature. In an interesting coincidence-that-may-not-be-a-coincidence, unusually hot days seem to have nearly the same effect on interpersonal violence in the United States as they do on suicide rates. Burke, who also co-authored the interpersonal-violence study, called the effects \u201cstartlingly similar\u201d in size. \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothesis, but there could be a similar biology that links your willingness to harm someone else with your willingness to harm yourself,\u201d he said. Until researchers understand that mechanism better, however, there is only one clear step that can blunt that future suicide-rate increase: We have to keep the planet\u2019s temperature from rising. \u201cIf we reduce future temperature increase, it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, the U.S. or Mexico,\u201d Burke said, \u201cyou are going to benefit from that reduction.\u201d Burke added that it was \u201cclearly baloney\u201d to claim that climate change is \u201cthe most important cause of suicide.\u201d \u201cPeople are really experiencing this day to day, and we want to be careful around that,\u201d he said. But from a societal perspective, \u201cwhen we look at the data, we see a relationship that is very strong.\u201d","headline":"Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050","article_name":565826.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/07\/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase\/565826\/","date_published":"2018-07-23 15:24:55","article_length":6371,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:22.822189","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/07\/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase\/565826\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new study explains why the controversial hiatus doesn\u2019t amount to much. It is the first year of the new Republican president\u2019s term. He has taken over a healthy economy from his Democratic predecessor, and, with it, the freedom to branch out beyond the typical Reaganism. He has also inherited a slew of environmental policies, many of which combat global warming. Most important among these is a fledgling UN treaty, a global agreement to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions. It was never ratified by the Senate, so the new president\u2014whose Cabinet members have deep ties to the oil and gas industry\u2014must decide whether to stay in the agreement or abandon it. Global warming does not obsess most Americans, but it frightens the scientists who study it. Just before the new president took office, an unprecedented and monstrous El Ni\u00f1o, the largest ever recorded, set a new annual global temperature record\u2014\u201cthe hottest year ever measured,\u201d as the newspapers put it. Ocean temperatures surged around the world, bleaching the Great Barrier Reef and inducing a mass coral die-off . Great cracks are even appearing in ancient Antarctic ice shelves. Climate change seems to be already under way. You know where this is going. The president, of course, was George W. Bush. In his first months in office, he decided to abandon negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol, which required the United States to cut its greenhouse gas emissions five percent below 1990 levels. He promised to supply a different climate policy later in his term. Environmentalists warned that soon global warming would become too devastating to ignore. And then it did something inconvenient. For about a decade following the El Ni\u00f1o of 1998, \u201cthe world seemed hardly to warm,\u201d as a new paper puts it. With some marked exceptions\u2014such as the devastating European heat wave of 2003 or the continued melting of mountain glaciers\u2014the global climate sent up few of the temperature sirens of the late 1990s. This period\u2014termed the global-warming hiatus, slowdown, or pause\u2014became one of the most controversial events in modern climatological history. Most scientific accounts of the hiatus say it was over by 2009. It has now ended by any measure. 2014, 2015, and 2016 all set new global temperature records, and eight of the 10 hottest years in the 120-year meteorological record have occurred in the last decade. A new paper takes stock of the global-warming hiatus , comparing scientific and popular accounts of the phenomenon. It finds that\u2014just as scientists predicted throughout the episode\u2014the existence of the hiatus did not disprove climate change. Nor did it indicate that global warming had halted or even slowed down. And more importantly, they find that the existence of the hiatus does not change end-of-century predictions for global warming. One of the problems with the \u201chiatus\u201d idea is that it was never well defined. Did a global-warming hiatus mean that Earth had stopped warming, or only that it was warming less than scientists expected? The paper\u2019s authors examine three different definitions of the hiatus: that Earth stayed the same temperature or even cooled, that Earth\u2019s rate of warming slowed down, and that climate models predicted Earth would warm more than it did. That first definition of the hiatus was the one that first caught on. In 2009, the global temperature data set put out by the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction, the U.K. government\u2019s climate-research office, appeared to show that temperatures over the previous nine years had very slightly decreased. To be precise, it said that the global mean temperature decreased by 0.01 degrees Celsius between 1998 and 2009. Researchers noted this was due mostly to a drop in ocean temperatures\u2014land temperatures continued to warm during this period. Over the next several years, scientists revisited that period in the data. They found that its underlying measurements masked a huge changeover in the technology used to actually record temperatures, especially of the oceans. In the early 2000s, ocean temperatures were mostly measured in hot engine rooms; by the late 2000s, they were mostly measured by standalone buoys and robotic floaters working alone in the open sea. This would have caused ocean temperature measurements at the early part of the decade to be biased toward warmth in a way that late-decade measurements weren\u2019t. Once this bias was corrected, the apparent decrease in temperatures from 1998 to 2009 went away. The first definition of the hiatus doesn\u2019t hold water. This correction carried a good deal of controversy: Thomas Karl, a longtime scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, first recommended that change in a landmark 2015 paper. Shortly thereafter, he was subpoenaed by Lamar Smith, a Republican congressman of Texas, who alleged the decision to \u201creadjust historical temperature records has broad national implications.\u201d Karl\u2019s office was subjected to a congressional investigation, but the scientific community has tested and upheld his team\u2019s findings. In an independent analysis released earlier this year, Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkley Earth, found that when you isolate temperature records taken by individual types of instruments\u2014for example, from only buoys, or from only satellites\u2014all the data sets follow the trend first identified by Karl. The second and third definitions of the hiatus rely on the two different ways that scientists talk about the global warming trend. The first warming trend is the rate of warming we\u2019ve already observed\u2014the 1.1 degree Celsius rise in temperatures that\u2019s been measured by thermometers, buoys, and ships over the last 120 years. The second warming rate is the one that we predict\u2014the eventual 1.5 to 4 degrees Ceslius of warming that computer models say will most likely occur by 2100. The second definition of the hiatus\u2014that temperatures increased, just by less than the observed trend\u2014also proves weak. For instance, whether a certain 15-year period after 1997 \u201cunderperforms\u201d depends greatly on whether you\u2019re measuring a long-term trend from the years between 1951 and 2000, or the years between 1951 and 2012. And no matter what, the difference between all those trends is not statistically significant. The final definition is the strongest of the three: Climate change did underperform the predicted trend during the hiatus. But that hiatus goes away, too, when the models are made to more accurately reflect the world as it was between 1998 and 2009. The hiatus period, for instance, is short\u2014less than a decade long\u2014so many small contingencies can affect its mean temperature. For example, if volcanos happen to belch a lot of sun-blocking gases into the atmosphere, temperatures will go down. If the Pacific Ocean has a number of La Ni\u00f1a events but no strong El Ni\u00f1os, temperatures will also look low. These kinds of variations even out at the century-scale, but not within decades. If you update 40 of the world\u2019s top climate models so that they contain the right number of gases and the right frequency of El Ni\u00f1o events, then they do a much better job of predicting the hiatus. But their long-term predictions don\u2019t change. They still find that Earth is still on track for 1.5 to 4 degrees Celsius of warming over the next 80 years\u2014just as they did before the update. In other words, you can \u201ctune\u201d the models to make them better mimic a certain span of years, but that tuning doesn\u2019t seem to teach them anything essential about the underlying Earth system. Climate scientists who were not connected to the study says the paper \u201ccloses the book\u201d on the hiatus period, summarizing the best science and allowing researchers to move on. They also noted that the hiatus has ended now by any measure. \u201cIt\u2019s 2014, 2015, and 2016 that killed the hiatus, and not any adjustment to the data. And the same thing is true if you look at the raw data without any fixes,\u201d Hausfather told me last week. \u201cIn fact, if you look at 1998 to 2016\u2014which is more of a fair comparison, because you start and end with an El Ni\u00f1o\u2014you see that the warming continues at the same trend. That\u2019s why, as climate scientists, we tend to focus on 30-year trends,\u201d he said. Kim Cobb, a paleoclimatologist at Georgia Tech, noted that the hiatus may contain a more ominous lesson for humankind. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why our world should walk at the model mean,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the public to understand there are two sides to the model mean. We\u2019ve found ourselves on the cooler side of that, but we might find ourselves on the warmer side of that as well. And that would be very challenging.\u201d To that point, some assessments of the climate literature\u2014such as Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman\u2019s book, Climate Shock \u2014 have found a 10-percent chance that the world will experience more than six degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by 2100. Chris Colose, a researcher at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, says that controversies like the hiatus will keep frustrating scientists as long as there is public dispute over the authority of climate science. \u201cI may be pessimistic, but I think bad-faith actors will seize upon anything they can find to cast doubt on climate science reliability,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBecause of the big El Ni\u00f1o event in 2016, I suspect that temperatures five to 10 years from now will be statistically comparable to 2016, even though 2016 to 2025 will be a warmer decade than the previous one,\u201d he added. \u201cIf climate science is still very polarized, I have little doubt people will be talking about \u2018how global warming ended in 2017,\u2019\u201d Colose told me. \u201cIt will be just as silly then, and hopefully all the hiatus talk this time around will serve as a compelling reason to ignore them.\u201d","headline":"Did Global Warming Really \u2018Pause\u2019 During the 2000s?","article_name":525645.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/did-global-warming-really-pause-during-the-2000s\/525645\/","date_published":"2017-05-12 08:00:00","article_length":9799,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:23.184533","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/did-global-warming-really-pause-during-the-2000s\/525645\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"He could prove cataclysmic. If he fulfills his campaign promises, President-Elect Donald J. Trump and his future administration could prove cataclysmic for the planet\u2019s climate. Trump\u2019s policies will likely ensure that the global mean temperature rises higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius. While that may seem like a small amount of warming, it would have devastating effects on a planetary scale, pushing weather patterns far outside what human civilization has previously experienced and ensuring mass extinctions. How could one president have so massive an effect? First, because Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, the first international treaty to mitigate global warming. This could shatter the international consensus on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, similar to how the second Bush administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol effectively ended that treaty\u2019s functional life within the United States. It could enable other countries to abandon their commitments and emit greenhouse gases at much higher rates. \u201cChina, Europe, Brazil, India and other countries will continue to move ahead with the climate commitments they made under Paris no matter what the next president does, because these commitments are in their own national interest,\u201d said Alden Meyer, the director of policy and strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in an email. While the Paris Agreement became international law this week\u2014making it technically impossible for a president to withdraw before 2019 or 2020\u2014Trump could simply refuse to recognize the agreement\u2019s obligations, the vast majority of which are non-binding. Trump also said, late in the campaign, that he would cut off American support for UN climate science. Second, Trump will almost certainly terminate President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, a set of EPA regulations meant to reduce emissions from the power sector. Lux Research, a global energy consulting group, estimated before the election that Trump\u2019s policies would lead to the emission of an additional 3.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as compared to Clinton\u2019s. These two factors alone could push the world over the edge. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that the planet could only stand another five years of emissions at current rates before it would become impossible to keep the global mean temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius. If emissions increased under a Trump administration, as Lux projects, then the world could overshoot that carbon budget well before 2021. Trump appears to doubt the existence of climate change itself. Though he later denied saying it, Trump tweeted before the campaign began that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese government to depress American industry. \u201cThe Paris Agreement was signed and ratified not by a President, but by the United States itself. As a matter of international law, and as a matter of human survival, the nations of the world can, must, and will hold the United States to its climate commitments,\u201d said Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the Center for International Climate Law. \u201cDonald Trump now has the unflattering distinction of being the only head of state in the entire world to reject the scientific consensus that mankind is driving climate change,\u201d said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, in a statement. \u201cNo matter what happens, Donald Trump can\u2019t change the fact that wind and solar energy are rapidly becoming more affordable and accessible than dirty fossil fuels. With both the market and grassroots environmental advocacy moving us toward clean energy, there is still a strong path forward for reducing climate pollution even under a Trump presidency.\u201d Indeed, Brune\u2019s statement hints at the next steps for climate activists. The Sierra Club has successfully retired more than 190 coal plants since 2003, leading a campaign that has relied more on local activism than federal support. Even if Trump seeks to expand the construction of coal-burning plants, those campaigns will likely continue. Activists are also likely to seek the creation of emissions-restriction plans in individual states. While Washington defeated a carbon-tax referendum last night, that measure was opposed by the state\u2019s left . Other state efforts at mitigating climate change have found more success. Earlier this year, California passed a series of state laws that will dramatically alter that state\u2019s energy profile, granting its state agency the freedom to cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030. It seems likely that environmental leaders will seek similar measures in other states. As Brune mentioned, wind energy and solar energy are also increasingly price-competitive with fossil fuels , especially in the sunny southwest and on the coast. If the United States embarks on the major round of new infrastructure construction that Trump has promised, then it would make economic sense for the country to build huge new wind and solar power plants. \u201cWhile there are divisions between the Democrats and Republicans on climate policy, there is bipartisan support for investments in clean energy and climate resilience. \u00a0The infrastructure initiatives that both Trump and Clinton put forward during the campaign present the opportunity to address both of these needs,\u201d said Meyer. Indeed, a recent Pew poll found that 89 percent of Americans approve of expanding solar power . Eighty-three percent want to expand wind farms. Constructing renewable-energy infrastructure across the country would increase U.S. manufacturing\u2019s skill at building new solar and wind technologies, help reduce the cost of electricity for ratepayers, and entrench support for clean power among both parties. Whether Trump, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell sign on to such a plan, though, may be another story.","headline":"What President Trump Will Mean for Earth\u2019s Climate","article_name":507098.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/what-president-trump-could-mean-for-climate-change\/507098\/","date_published":"2016-11-09 16:56:49","article_length":5879,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:23.942217","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/what-president-trump-could-mean-for-climate-change\/507098\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The party doesn\u2019t even seem to realize that it\u2019s blowing a once-in-a-decade chance to pass meaningful climate legislation. Sign up for The Weekly Planet, Robinson Meyer\u2019s newsletter about living through climate change, here. MIAMI BEACH, Fla.\u2014On Monday night, I saw one of the most despair-inducing performances about the hope of climate action that I\u2019ve witnessed in years. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, took the stage here at the Aspen Ideas: Climate festival to discuss what congressional Democrats are doing on climate change. Her remarks were more effective as a litany of missed opportunities. Susan Goldberg, recently the editor in chief of National Geographic , now a dean at Arizona State University, asked the speaker point-blank whether Democrats were going to pass climate legislation, and Pelosi all but shrugged. The House has already passed a roughly $2 trillion bill containing President Joe Biden\u2019s climate priorities, she said. Now it was in the Senate\u2019s hands. If it happened to get a bill back to her, the House would pass it. Missing was any sense that this legislation is a make-or-break moment for the broader Democratic caucus. Gone was any suggestion that if Democrats fail to pass a bill this term, then America\u2019s climate commitment under the Paris Agreement will be out of reach, and worse heat waves, larger wildfires, and damaging famines across the country and around the world within the next decade and a half will be all but assured. Pelosi did not seem to understand, really, why Congress needed to pass a climate law this session. (She seemed to blame the fossil-fuel industry for the current Congress\u2019s inaction.) She repeatedly justified climate action by saying it was \u201cfor the children.\u201d This became the rhetorical leitmotif of her remarks\u2014Congress had to act \u201cfor the children.\u201d Explaining why she wanted more women in Congress, she said that they had to learn to \u201cthrow a punch\u2014for the children.\u201d That line was how she closed. Aside from the Helen Lovejoy\u2013esque nature of this appeal , it is factually wrong. Climate action was \u201cfor the children\u201d in the 1990s. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this for the children,\u201d Kate Larsen, an energy analyst at the Rhodium Group, told me after the event. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for us!\u201d Heat waves hot enough to cook human flesh are already happening this month; they will become more common over the coming decades, striking multiple times a year. Unbearable droughts, sea-level rise so high as to break levees , and unpredictable famines will characterize life. Most of the world\u2019s coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, will undergo bleaching every few years , meaning the water will be so hot that the coral will eject their symbiotic microorganisms into the water, starving themselves in the process. The speech seemed to punctuate the collapse of climate politics over the past year. During the campaign, Biden described climate change as one of the country\u2019s four major overlapping crises. Yet his administration seems to be sleepwalking toward inaction. Five months ago, Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia, killed Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill after the White House repeatedly ignored his attempts to pare it down. Since then, Democrats have been stuck in limbo, with Manchin laying out some of his terms for a replacement bill, and Democrats neglecting to put together a new bill reflecting those terms. It now seems likely that Democrats will lose control of Congress with only a bipartisan infrastructure bill to show for their trouble. Then they face overwhelming odds. Because of the geographic apportionment of their supporters, Democrats can win 51 percent of votes cast in the 2022 and 2024 elections and still lose eight Senate seats. I have heard estimates that the party must win eight points more than Republicans to pick up a Senate seat. Unless inflation abates, such an outcome will be so unlikely that it\u2019s essentially impossible, consigning Democrats to minority status for years to come. Republicans, by contrast, have a plausible path to more than 60 seats, allowing them to pass legislation over that institution\u2019s filibuster. At the same time, the Biden administration could soon lose its ability to regulate climate change at all. The Supreme Court could restrict the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate greenhouse gases this term. It could also curtail Chevron deference , a legal doctrine that gives executive agencies more freedom to operate when the underlying law is unclear. In the past, both concepts have been central to Democratic climate-rule making. Both could be gone by 2023. When reminded of this bleak outlook, climate progressives point to corporate action and the stock market, which both seemed to be moving in their direction. During the 2010s, most oil companies failed to turn a profit, validating activists\u2019 demands that institutions should divest of fossil-fuel stock. But the markets have turned since the pandemic began. Oil-company stocks are some of the best performing of the past year. Funds that emphasize ESG, or \u201cenvironmental, social, governance,\u201d a vague category that covers such divergent topics as a company\u2019s carbon footprint, how many women it has on its board, or how favorable it is to organized labor, have also underperformed in the recent market rout. At another conference here last month, the libertarian venture capitalist Peter Thiel attacked ESG as \u201ca hate factory\u201d and compared it to the \u201cChinese Communist Party.\u201d This week, he backed a fund that would take intentionally anti-progressive stances . Historically, progressives haven\u2019t been too fond of ESG either, seeing it as a form of Wall Street greenwashing (or worse). But on climate, specifically, it has worked in their favor, allowing managers to take a less-than-direct approach to shareholder value and push forward loss-leading initiatives to reduce carbon pollution. What all of this means is that, the next time a climate-skeptical president takes office, advocates will have fewer tools to constrain their behavior than last time. And they will have no future to point to: If Democrats couldn\u2019t pass a climate bill in 2009 or 2022, why should anyone have any hope that they\u2019ll try to do it again, or be able to? Since 2017, a surge of global concern\u2014much of it triggered by revulsion at President Donald Trump and by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 1.5 Celsius report\u2014signaled a new era of climate action. That tide is ebbing. American climate advocates may have almost nothing to show for it.","headline":"The Democrats Really Are That Dense About Climate Change","article_name":629822.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/05\/nancy-pelosi-democrats-climate-change-bill\/629822\/","date_published":"2022-05-11 11:30:00","article_length":6565,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:24.901838","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/05\/nancy-pelosi-democrats-climate-change-bill\/629822\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Conservatives mock the Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, but there\u2019s evidence of a connection between drought and the Syrian civil war. It\u2019s the dog days of summer for U.S. presidential candidates, when Donald Trump is dominating the airwaves and candidates who seem to be losing their purchase at the polls are doing whatever they can to capture some attention\u2014whether that\u2019s taking a chainsaw to the tax code , like Rand Paul, or claiming there\u2019s a connection between ISIS and climate change, like Martin O\u2019Malley. \u201cOne of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis that created the symptoms\u2014or rather, the conditions\u2014of extreme poverty that has led now to the rise of ISIL and this extreme violence,\u201d the Democratic candidate told Bloomberg on Monday. Actually, hold that thought on O\u2019Malley. His comment was noted by the Republican opposition-research organization America Rising and promptly mocked by conservative media outlets . The Republican National Committee issued a statement ripping O\u2019Malley, which he was probably happy to get. But O\u2019Malley\u2019s comment isn\u2019t as weird as it might initially seem. There\u2019s an established body of work that draws a connection between drought, resource scarcity, and conflict in general. In a 2013 article for The Atlantic, William Polk, a historian and former adviser to President Kennedy, noted a possible relationship between Syria\u2019s civil war and devastating 2006-2011 drought. \u201cAs they flocked into the cities and towns seeking work and food, the \u2018economic\u2019 or \u2018climate\u2019 refugees immediately found that they had to compete not only with one another for scarce food, water, and jobs, but also with the existing foreign refugee population,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFormerly prosperous farmers were lucky to get jobs as hawkers or street sweepers. And in the desperation of the times, hostilities erupted among groups that were competing just to survive.\u201d In addition, a paper published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences specifically connects a severe drought across the Levant to the Syrian conflict. The case isn\u2019t a direct one. \u201cBefore the Syrian uprising that began in 2011, the greater Fertile Crescent experienced the most severe drought in the instrumental record,\u201d the authors write, arguing that the drought is connected to a long-term change in the climate in the Eastern Mediterranean. \u201cFor Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest.\u201d ISIS existed in different form, as the Islamic State of Iraq, prior to the outbreak of the civil war, but the collapse of the Syrian state, combined with the fecklessness of the Iraqi armed forces and government, allowed the group to expand its reach and influence, and declare a caliphate. Of course, scientists and security consultants get nervous when the media covers studies such as this one. They worry, in particular, about the impression that wars can be reduced to a single cause. ( As one told The Guardian in May about the PNAS study, \u201cI\u2019ll put this in a crude way: No amount of climate change is going to cause civil violence in the state where I live (Massachusetts), or in Sweden or many other places around the world.\u201d) Still, O\u2019Malley did a pretty good job compressing the study\u2019s findings into a short explanation and contextualizing it as creating the conditions for ISIS\u2019s success, rather than drawing a direct causal link between climate change and the Islamic State. It\u2019s easy to see how the baldest summary of this claim\u2014 a presidential candidate says that global warming created a huge jihadist group! \u2014comes across as silly. But the unfortunate reality is that climate change will likely produce more evidence in the years ahead of the connection between resource scarcity and war\u2014whether it\u2019s fodder for presidential campaigns or not.","headline":"Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s Link Between Climate Change and ISIS Isn\u2019t Crazy","article_name":399131.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/07\/martin-omalley-isis-climate-change\/399131\/","date_published":"2015-07-22 11:48:22","article_length":4119,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:25.711778","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/07\/martin-omalley-isis-climate-change\/399131\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"At least for now, we can\u2019t just trap carbon in the soil. The hope was that the soil might save us. With civilization continuing to pump ever-increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, perhaps plants\u2014nature\u2019s carbon scrubbers\u2014might be able to package up some of that excess carbon and bury it underground for centuries or longer. That hope has fueled increasingly ambitious climate-change-mitigation plans. Researchers at the Salk Institute, for example, hope to bioengineer plants whose roots will churn out huge amounts of a carbon-rich, corklike substance called suberin. Even after the plant dies, the thinking goes, the carbon in the suberin should stay buried for centuries. This Harnessing Plants Initiative is perhaps the brightest star in a crowded firmament of climate-change solutions based on the brown stuff beneath our feet. Such plans depend crucially on the existence of large, stable, carbon-rich molecules that can last hundreds or thousands of years underground. Such molecules, collectively called humus, have long been a keystone of soil science; major agricultural practices and sophisticated climate models are built on them. But over the past 10 years or so, soil science has undergone a quiet revolution, akin to what would happen if, in physics, relativity or quantum mechanics were overthrown. Except in this case, almost nobody has heard about it\u2014including many who hope soils can rescue the climate. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are interested in sequestration who haven\u2019t caught up yet,\u201d says Margaret Torn, a soil scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A new generation of soil studies powered by modern microscopes and imaging technologies has revealed that whatever humus is, it is not the long-lasting substance scientists believed it to be. Soil researchers have concluded that even the largest, most complex molecules can be quickly devoured by soil\u2019s abundant and voracious microbes. The magic molecule you can just stick in the soil and expect to stay there may not exist. \u201cI have The Nature and Properties of Soils in front of me\u2014the standard textbook,\u201d says Gregg Sanford, a soil researcher at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cThe theory of soil organic carbon accumulation that\u2019s in that textbook has been proven mostly false \u2026 and we\u2019re still teaching it.\u201d The consequences go far beyond carbon-sequestration strategies. Major climate models such as those produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are based on this outdated understanding of soil. Several recent  studies indicate that those models are underestimating the total amount of carbon that will be released from soil in a warming climate. In addition, computer models that predict the greenhouse-gas impacts of farming practices\u2014predictions that are being used in carbon markets\u2014are probably overly optimistic about soil\u2019s ability to trap and hold on to carbon. It may still be possible to store carbon underground long term. Indeed, radioactive-dating measurements suggest that some amount of carbon can stay in the soil for centuries. But until soil scientists build a new paradigm to replace the old\u2014a process now underway\u2014no one will fully understand why. Soil doesn\u2019t give up its secrets easily. Its constituents are tiny, varied and outrageously numerous. At a bare minimum, it consists of minerals, decaying organic matter, air, water, and enormously complex ecosystems of microorganisms. One teaspoon of healthy soil contains more bacteria, fungi, and other microbes than there are humans on Earth. The German biologist Franz Karl Achard was an early pioneer in making sense of the chaos. In a seminal 1786 study, he used alkalis to extract molecules made of long carbon chains from peat soils. Over the centuries, scientists came to believe that such long chains, collectively called humus, constituted a large pool of soil carbon that resists decomposition and pretty much just sits there. A smaller fraction consisting of shorter molecules was thought to feed microbes, which respired carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This view was occasionally challenged, but by the mid-20th century, the humus paradigm was \u201cthe only game in town,\u201d says Johannes Lehmann, a soil scientist at Cornell University. Farmers were instructed to adopt practices that were supposed to build humus. Indeed, the existence of humus is probably one of the few soil-science facts that many nonscientists could recite. What helped break humus\u2019s hold on soil science was physics. In the second half of the 20th century, powerful new microscopes and techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray spectroscopy allowed soil scientists to peer directly into soil for the first time and see what was there, rather than pull things out and then look at them. What they found\u2014or, more specifically, what they didn\u2019t find\u2014was shocking: There were few or no long \u201crecalcitrant\u201d carbon molecules\u2014the kind that don\u2019t break down. Almost everything seemed to be small and, in principle, digestible. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any molecules in soil that are so recalcitrant that they can\u2019t be broken down,\u201d says Jennifer Pett-Ridge, a soil scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. \u201cMicrobes will learn to break anything down\u2014even really nasty chemicals.\u201d Lehmann, whose studies using advanced microscopy and spectroscopy were among the first to reveal the absence of humus, has become the concept\u2019s debunker in chief. A 2015 Nature paper he co-authored states that \u201cthe available evidence does not support the formation of large-molecular-size and persistent \u2018humic substances\u2019 in soils.\u201d In 2019, he gave a talk with a slide containing a mock death announcement for \u201cour friend, the concept of Humus.\u201d Over the past decade or so, most soil scientists have come to accept this view. Yes, soil is enormously varied. And it contains a lot of carbon. But there\u2019s no carbon in soil that can\u2019t, in principle, be broken down by microorganisms and released into the atmosphere. The latest edition of The Nature and Properties of Soils , published in 2016, cites Lehmann\u2019s 2015 paper and acknowledges that \u201cour understanding of the nature and genesis of soil humus has advanced greatly since the turn of the century, requiring that some long-accepted concepts be revised or abandoned.\u201d Old ideas, however, can be very recalcitrant. Few outside the field of soil science have heard of humus\u2019s demise. At the same time that soil scientists were rediscovering what exactly soil is, climate researchers were revealing that increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were rapidly warming the climate, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Thoughts soon turned to using soil as a giant carbon sink. Soils contain enormous amounts of carbon\u2014more carbon than in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and all its vegetation combined. And while certain practices such as plowing can stir up that carbon\u2014farming, over human history, has released an estimated 133 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere\u2014soils can also take up carbon, as plants die and their roots decompose. Scientists began to suggest that we might be able to coax large volumes of atmospheric carbon back into the soil to dampen or even reverse the damage of climate change. In practice, this has proved difficult. An early idea to increase carbon stores\u2014planting crops without tilling the soil\u2014has mostly fallen flat. When farmers skipped the tilling and instead drilled seeds into the ground, carbon stores grew in upper soil layers, but they disappeared from lower layers. Most experts now believe that the practice redistributes carbon within the soil rather than increases it, though it can improve other factors, such as water quality and soil health. Efforts like the Harnessing Plants Initiative represent something like soil-carbon sequestration 2.0: a more direct intervention to essentially jam a bunch of carbon into the ground. The initiative emerged when a team of scientists at the Salk Institute came up with an idea: Create plants whose roots produce an excess of carbon-rich molecules. By their calculations, if grown widely, such plants might sequester up to 20 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that humans add to the atmosphere every year. The scientists zeroed in on suberin, which is produced by many plant roots. Studies from the 1990s and 2000s had hinted that suberin and similar molecules could resist decomposition in soil. With flashy marketing, the Harnessing Plants Initiative gained attention. An initial round of fundraising in 2019 brought in more than $35 million. Last year, the multibillionaire Jeff Bezos contributed $30 million from his \u201cEarth Fund.\u201d But as the project gained momentum, it attracted doubters. One group of researchers noted in 2016 that no one had actually observed the suberin decomposition process. When those authors did the relevant experiment, they found that much of the suberin decayed quickly. In 2019, Joan Chory , a plant geneticist and one of the Harnessing Plant Initiative\u2019s project leaders, described the project at a TED conference. Asmeret Asefaw Berhe , a soil scientist at the University of California at Merced, who spoke at the same conference, pointed out to Chory that according to modern soil science, suberin, like any carbon-containing compound, should break down in soil. (Berhe, who has been nominated to lead the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science, declined an interview request.) Around the same time, Hanna Poffenbarger , a soil researcher at the University of Kentucky, made a similar comment after hearing \u00a0 Wolfgang Busch , the other project leader, speak at a workshop. \u201cYou should really get some soil scientists on board, because the assumption that we can breed for more recalcitrant roots\u2014that may not be valid,\u201d Poffenbarger recalls telling Busch. Questions about the project surfaced publicly earlier this year, when Jonathan Sanderman , a soil scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, tweeted , \u201cI thought the soil biogeochem community had moved on from the idea that there is a magical recalcitrant plant compound. Am I missing some important new literature on suberin?\u201d Another soil scientist responded , \u201cNope, the literature suggests that suberin will be broken down just like every other organic plant component.\u201d Busch, in an interview, acknowledged that \u201cthere is no unbreakable biomolecule.\u201d But, citing published  papers on suberin\u2019s resistance to decomposition, he said, \u201cWe are still very optimistic when it comes to suberin.\u201d He also noted a second initiative Salk researchers are pursuing in parallel to enhancing suberin. They are trying to design plants with longer roots that could deposit carbon deeper in soil. Independent experts such as Sanderman agree that carbon tends to stick around longer in deeper soil layers, putting that solution on potentially firmer conceptual ground. Chory and Busch have also launched collaborations with Berhe and Poffenbarger, respectively. Poffenbarger, for example, will analyze how soil samples containing suberin-rich plant roots change under different environmental conditions. But even those studies won\u2019t answer questions about how long suberin sticks around, Poffenbarger says\u2014important if the goal is to keep carbon out of the atmosphere long enough to make a dent in global warming. Beyond the Salk project, momentum and money are flowing toward other climate projects that would rely on long-term carbon sequestration and storage in soils. In an April speech to Congress, for example, President Joe Biden suggested paying farmers to plant cover crops, which are grown not for harvest but to nurture the soil in between plantings of cash crops. Evidence suggests that when cover-crop roots break down, some of their carbon stays in the soil\u2014although, as with suberin, how long it lasts is an open question. Recalcitrant carbon may also be warping climate predictions. In the 1960s, scientists began writing large, complex computer programs to predict the global climate\u2019s future. Because soil both takes up and releases carbon dioxide, climate models attempted to take into account soil\u2019s interactions with the atmosphere. But the global climate is fantastically complex, and to enable the programs to run on the machines of the time, simplifications were necessary. For soil, scientists made a big one: They ignored microbes in the soil entirely. Instead, they basically divided soil carbon into short-term and long-term pools, in accordance with the humus paradigm. More recent generations of models, including ones that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses for its widely read reports, are essentially palimpsests built on earlier ones, says Torn. They still assume soil carbon exists in long-term and short-term pools. As a consequence, these models may be overestimating how much carbon will stick around in soils and underestimating how much carbon dioxide they will emit. Last summer, a study published in Nature examined how much carbon dioxide was released when researchers artificially warmed the soil in a Panamanian tropical forest to mimic the long-term effects of climate change. They found that the warmed soil released 55 percent more carbon than nearby unwarmed areas\u2014a much larger release than predicted by most climate models. The researchers think that microbes in the soil grow more active at the warmer temperatures, leading to the increase. The study was especially disheartening because most of the world\u2019s soil carbon is in the tropics and the northern boreal zone. Despite this, leading soil models are calibrated to results of soil studies in temperate countries such as the U.S. and those in Europe, where most studies have historically been done. \u201cWe\u2019re doing pretty bad in high latitudes and the tropics,\u201d says Lehmann. Even temperate climate models need improvement. Torn and colleagues reported earlier this year that, contrary to predictions, deep soil layers in a California forest released roughly a third of their carbon when warmed for four and a half years. Ultimately, Torn says, models need to represent soil as something closer to what it actually is: a complex, three-dimensional environment governed by a hyper-diverse community of carbon-gobbling bacteria, fungi, and other microscopic beings. But even smaller steps would be welcome. Just adding microbes as a single class would be major progress for most models, she says. If the humus paradigm is coming to an end, the question becomes: What will replace it? One important and long-overlooked factor appears to be the three-dimensional structure of the soil environment. Scientists describe soil as a world unto itself, with the equivalent of continents, oceans, and mountain ranges. This complex microgeography determines where microbes such as bacteria and fungi can go and where they can\u2019t; what food they can gain access to and what is off limits. A soil bacterium \u201cmay be only 10 microns away from a big chunk of organic matter that I\u2019m sure they would love to degrade, but it\u2019s on the other side of a cluster of minerals,\u201d says Pett-Ridge. \u201cIt\u2019s literally as if it\u2019s on the other side of the planet.\u201d Another related, and poorly understood, ingredient in a new soil paradigm is the fate of carbon within the soil. Researchers now believe that almost all organic material that enters soil will get digested by microbes. \u201cNow it\u2019s really clear that soil organic matter is just this loose assemblage of plant matter in varying degrees of degradation,\u201d says Sanderman. Some will then be respired into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. What remains could be eaten by another microbe\u2014and a third, and so on. Or it could bind to a bit of clay or get trapped inside a soil aggregate: a porous clump of particles that, from a microbe\u2019s point of view, could be as large as a city and as impenetrable as a fortress. Studies of carbon isotopes have shown that a lot of carbon can stick around in soil for centuries or even longer. If humus isn\u2019t doing the stabilizing, perhaps minerals and aggregates are. Before soil science settles on a new theory, there will doubtless be more surprises. One may have been delivered recently by a group of researchers at Princeton University who constructed a simplified artificial soil using microfluidic devices\u2014essentially, tiny plastic channels for moving around bits of fluid and cells. The researchers found that carbon they put inside an aggregate made of bits of clay was protected from bacteria. But when they added a digestive enzyme, the carbon was freed from the aggregate and quickly gobbled up. \u201cTo our surprise, no one had drawn this connection between enzymes, bacteria, and trapped carbon,\u201d says Howard Stone , an engineer who led the study. Lehmann is pushing to replace the old dichotomy of stable and unstable carbon with a \u201csoil continuum model\u201d of carbon in progressive stages of decomposition. But this model and others like it are far from complete, and at this point, more conceptual than mathematically predictive. Researchers agree that soil science is in the midst of a classic paradigm shift. What nobody knows is exactly where the field will land\u2014what will be written in the next edition of the textbook. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a conceptual revolution,\u201d says Mark Bradford, a soil scientist at Yale University. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really got a new cathedral yet. We have a whole bunch of churches that have popped up.\u201d This post appears courtesy of Quanta Magazine .","headline":"A Major Climate Idea Is Based on Some Shaky Science","article_name":619611.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/07\/soil-revolution-climate-change\/619611\/","date_published":"2021-07-31 12:00:00","article_length":17519,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:26.539964","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/07\/soil-revolution-climate-change\/619611\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Of course Democratic candidates should square off on the issue. Here\u2019s what a moderator should ask. For the past week, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidates, grassroots organizers, and national committee have fought over whether it would be a good idea to have a \u201cclimate-change debate.\u201d Governor Jay Inslee of Washington, whose presidential campaign is focused on climate change, started the fight a few weeks ago, when he demanded that Democrats devote one of their dozen scheduled primary debates to climate change\u2014both to what it will mean domestically and internationally and to what candidates presume to do about it. Last week, the Democratic National Committee responded by telling Inslee that it wouldn\u2019t hold a climate debate\u2014and that if he appeared in one, it would block him from all future officially sanctioned debates. Inslee responded with outrage, and since then the DNC has been trying to defend itself. Tom Perez, the DNC chair, has tried to justify the DNC\u2019s decision in a few different ways. He published a Medium post titled \u201cOn Debates\u201d earlier this week. \u201cIf we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign\u2019s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we\u2019ve had?\u201d he pleaded. The tone demonstrates how poorly the DNC has fared here: Almost nobody has ever published a hyper-earnest Medium post from a position of strength. The DNC actually has a fine reason for declining Inslee\u2019s request: Adding a single-issue climate debate would be against its rules, which it wrote to account for, and avoid, the bitterness left over from 2016 . But the DNC is pretty weak here. Polls suggest that climate change is a top-tier issue for the party\u2019s primary voters. At this point, 14 candidates have expressed some interest in a climate debate \u201415, if you include Joe Biden\u2019s quick assent to the idea, captured on video by a Greenpeace activist. If five of them, including Elizabeth Warren, go rogue and hold a climate debate of their own, will the DNC really bar them from its official debates? Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change All of this is political tactics\u2014forgettable and kind of whatever. (Though maybe it should concern the DNC that a candidate polling at 1 percent could play it for a week straight.) What\u2019s more interesting is the loose consensus among climate and energy experts that a climate debate would do more harm than good. When three writers at New York magazine discussed \u201cShould Democrats hold a climate-change debate?\u201d they concluded that Inslee was right on the substance and wrong on the politics. A climate debate would be lousy television, they said. It would be too wonky to interest voters. And it could ultimately endanger the party\u2019s general-election hopes. \u201cThe deeper candidates get into the weeds about actual policy, the likelier they are to say something that backfires in the fall,\u201d wrote David Wallace-Wells . I understand this argument. Climate-change policy, as I have written in the past, can be staggeringly boring . But it\u2019s not all dull, and voters seem to care about it. A climate-change debate is a swell idea. It just requires rethinking much of what\u2019s accepted about climate politics and about debates. What\u2019s the point of a presidential debate? More than 20 years ago, in a story for this magazine , James Fallows pointed out a fundamental divide between the kind of information that journalists create and the kind of information that most helps voters. Journalists try to generate news: gaffes, scoops, novel data, interesting interpretations of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the political game. But voters ask about the what of politics: \u201cthe effects of legislation or government programs on their communities or schools.\u201d As we hold them today, moderated by television journalists and broadcast live, debates seem designed to generate that first kind of news. Recently, the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes noted that a straightforward question a voter posed to Warren\u2014\u201cWhat are you going to do about the opioid crisis? It\u2019s affecting everyone.\u201d\u2014was \u201cthe kind of question a journalist \u2026 almost certainly wouldn\u2019t ask.\u201d This is not an atypical critique of political journalism, and Americans have partly absorbed it since the 1990s. Yet it still infects our debates, which are one of the best opportunities to inform voters about the actual policy stakes of an election. A 2016 report from public-policy researchers at the University of Pennsylvania recommended a number of improvements to the televised-debate format. ( Vox made a good video about it .) One of their recommendations that has stuck with me the longest: \u201cEnlarge the pool of potential moderators to include print journalists, university presidents, retired judges and other experts.\u201d In that vein, a climate debate could do plenty of good. Climate is a top-tier issue for voters in the Democratic Party, yet voters remain somewhat underinformed about it. This is \u2026 exactly what a debate could address. Moderators could start by asking the following questions, proposed on Twitter by David Hawkins : 1. What concerns you most about climate change? 2. What areas would you prioritize for federal funding? 3. How much federal spending would you propose for next decade? 4. How would you get support for this spending? 5. What steps would you take to reduce the ideological divide? We already know the candidates disagree about some of these: Biden has proposed $1.5 trillion in climate spending; Inslee has proposed $3 trillion; most candidates have proposed nothing. Why are those numbers the right choice? Where should the money be spent? After that opening, moderators could pose questions that have legitimately tricky answers. Questions such as: To all candidates: Dozens of economists say a carbon tax is the best and cheapest way to fight climate change. But they\u2019ve had little success in the United States, both in state legislatures and at the ballot box. Do you support a carbon tax? Governor Inslee, you say that America has to lead in fighting the climate crisis. But China already emits more carbon pollution than the United States, and India will soon outrank us as well. Why is this America\u2019s battle to fight? What can the United States do about other country\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions? Vice President Biden, you have discussed the importance of fighting climate change. President Barack Obama also said fighting climate change was important in 2008, but he failed to pass a climate bill through the Senate, and he didn\u2019t help complete a climate treaty until the end of his second term. Why will you be different? Senator Warren, you have proposed dozens of plans to bring about \u201cbroad structural change\u201d in the United States. Some of these plans mention climate change, but many don\u2019t. In your flurry of reform, where will you rank fighting climate change? Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, you have released an aggressive plan for fighting climate change. Your home state of Texas is undergoing an economic boom due to increased oil and natural-gas drilling. How will you weigh the benefits of fighting climate change\u2014which will require keeping many of those fossil fuels in the ground\u2014with this burst of short-term economic prosperity? I am curious about their answers to these questions! I bet many voters are, too. And anyway, look, the candidates will not be arguing over the nuances of soil-carbon maintenance. Take the two hours of debate a night, subtract at least 20 minutes for intros and interstitials, divide it among the 10 candidates onstage, and you get at most 10 minutes a person. Ten minutes is a lot, but it\u2019s not enough time for Bernie Sanders to explore the pros and cons of negative-emissions technologies. The candidates are going to spend most of the time describing their plans (or lack thereof). Read: The Green New Deal has already won Some experts argue that candidates will overpromise in a climate debate. Candidates might, say, claim that they can decarbonize the United States by 2030, when in fact that is technologically impossible. But\u2014again\u2014why is that a good reason to avoid a debate? Candidates will overpromise anyway, and it\u2019s not like voters will automatically believe the most radical climate plan they hear. (Some polling suggests the opposite may happen.) Right now, across a whole range of issues\u2014health care, student-loan debt, immigration\u2014the main argument in the Democratic Party is between radicals who want broad structural change and moderates who argue that such an overhaul is unrealistic. Why can voters understand a debate about reforming Obamacare versus adopting Medicare for All, but not understand one about climate change? To presume that voters aren\u2019t ready for a climate debate strikes me as low-key antidemocratic. And if climate change is a problem that affects everyone, addressing it is going to take everyone\u2019s involvement, too.","headline":"Don\u2019t Overthink a Climate-Change Debate","article_name":591658.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/06\/case-primary-debate-about-climate-change\/591658\/","date_published":"2019-06-14 19:17:50","article_length":8938,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:26.989794","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/06\/case-primary-debate-about-climate-change\/591658\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A $100 million fund gives homeowners low-cost loans for energy efficiency upgrades to one of the biggest sources of global warming \u2013 their houses.\u00a0 The latest series of reports from the United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in stark terms the catastrophic consequences of the world\u2019s governments\u2019 decades-long foot-dragging on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But what can you do? For one thing, fix up your damn house. That furnace, from the Reagan era, the inefficient water heater, the drafty windows? They\u2019re directly contributing to climate change. Homes consume 22 percent of the U.S.\u2019s energy and, along with commercial buildings, account for 10 percent of the United States\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. The chances of the U.S. government enacting a carbon tax, emissions trading scheme or taking other sweeping action to tackle climate change may be next to nil. But thanks to an innovative new initiative from financial conglomerate Citi, the Pennsylvania state treasury and non-profits, homeowners across the country soon will be able to tap a $100 million fund to instantly secure low-cost loans to do everything from installing solar panels on their roof to replacing that roof. \u00a0Contractors will authorized to offer the loans, meaning no need to deal with state or local bureaucrats who will administer the program. It\u2019s just another example of how financial innovation has become key to getting the green tech innovations dreamed up in Silicon Valley into the hands of homeowners as well as prompting them to undertake low-tech efforts like insulating their attics. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that energy efficiency technology has outpaced the financial technology,\u201d Cisco DeVries, chief executive of Renewable Funding, an Oakland, California, company that designs green energy-financing programs, told The Atlantic. Renewable Funding later this year will begin to securitize the loans \u2013 called Warehouse for Energy Efficiency Loans, or WHEEL \u2013 and sell the securities to pension funds and other investors. That will generate a cash flow to fund further energy efficiency improvements. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve set up is an indefinitely scalable program,\u201d says DeVries.\u00a0 \u201cWe can purchase loans and securitize them and the more we do it, the cheaper the funds become. This has no limit to its capacity.\u201d It will certainly need to scale. According to a 2009 McKinsey study it\u2019ll take $229 billion to cut home energy use by about a third. Still, until WHEEL most homeowners faced with spending five figures on just replacing their windows either had to tap home equity lines or their high-interest credit cards to pay for such improvements. And people tend to make energy efficiency fixes piece-meal, replacing the hot water heater when it breaks, for instance. The availability of a five, seven or 10-year loan would encourage people to obtain energy audits and comprehensive upgrades to their homes. The payoff is lower energy bills that would help pay back the loans. Three years in the works, WHEEL is based on a successful Pennsylvania program and initially is available in that state and Kentucky. DeVries expects California and other states to be added by the end of 2014 with nationwide coverage in 2015.","headline":"Wall Street Wants to Lend You Money to Fight Climate Change","article_name":360891.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/04\/wall-street-wants-to-lend-you-money-to-fight-climate-change\/360891\/","date_published":"2014-04-18 15:19:47","article_length":3229,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:27.823649","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/04\/wall-street-wants-to-lend-you-money-to-fight-climate-change\/360891\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"Representative John Shimkus of Illinois is vying to chair the House Energy Committee as the Republicans organize their caucus. Shimkus would have jurisdiction over any global warming legislation to come through the House of Representatives in the coming session if appointed. Shimkus is an unlikely victor, as Representative Joe Barton of Texas has seniority. Shimkus has served on the committee since 1997, and promises a more aggressive approach than Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, his other competitor. Shimkus sees climate change in a biblical context. In March 2009, speaking to the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, Shimkus quoted Chapter 8, Verse 22 of Genesis to explain his belief that the earth will not be destroyed by climate change. \"Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though all inclinations of his heart are evil from childhood and never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will never cease.\" He went on to say , \"I believe that is the infallible word of god, and that's the way it is going to be for his creation... The earth will end only when God declares its time to be over. Man will not destroy this earth. This earth will not be destroyed by a flood.\" You can imagine that people in Haiti and Pakistan, where hundreds of thousands of people have been pushed from their homes from flooding this year, might disagree with his comment. For them, flooding is very real. Juan Cole and Andrew Leonard cover this story as well. According to the Wonk Room , following midterm elections, half of the Republican caucus in the U.S. Congress now questions the scientific consensus of global warming. Additional research suggests that 45 of 97 Republican freshmen and 85 of 166 reelected Republicans are confirmed climate deniers. The end of days concept, which exists in some form in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, proclaims the day when God destroys humanity and the earth in order to wipe out our sins and reconsecrate the world in justice with the coming of the Messiah. There's no shortage of end of days evangelists in the U.S. Congress, but few believe that humans are affecting the climate. Maybe it's time for those who believe in an end of days scenario to herald global warming as a proof of concept.","headline":"Climate Change Denier Aims to Chair House Energy Committee","article_name":66374.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2010\/11\/climate-change-denier-aims-to-chair-house-energy-committee\/66374\/","date_published":"2010-11-10 19:46:36","article_length":2392,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:28.756404","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2010\/11\/climate-change-denier-aims-to-chair-house-energy-committee\/66374\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"He has no evidence. He\u2019ll successfully mislead people anyway. It was a bright warm day in March, and while the clocks weren\u2019t quite striking thirteen , something was awry. Scott Pruitt, the new chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, was rejecting the international scientific consensus about human-caused global warming. He did it, actually, about when the clocks were striking nine Thursday morning, in an appearance on CNBC\u2019s morning news program, Squawk Box. \u201cDo you believe that it\u2019s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob on climate?\u201d asked Joe Kernen, a host on the show. \u201cNo,\u201d said Pruitt . \u201cI believe that measuring, with precision, human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So, no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\u201d \u201cWe need to continue the review and analysis,\u201d he added. This is wrong. There is not \u201ctremendous disagreement\u201d about Kernen\u2019s question. Pruitt\u2019s claim runs so counter to the findings of the international scientific community, to the conclusions of the U.S. government, and even to the marketing materials of the oil-and-gas industry that it is difficult to label it anything but a falsehood. The scientific evidence on this question\u2014 does carbon dioxide, as emitted by human activity, cause climate change?\u2014 has been available for decades. Since the late 1970s, climate scientists have suggested that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might cause global warming. In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of thousands of the world\u2019s climate scientists, announced that the \u201cbalance of evidence\u201d suggested that this had caused ongoing global warming. This conclusion only strengthened throughout the 2000s. By 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced that there was at least a 95 percent chance that CO\u2082 was causing global warming. Two branches of the U.S. government have also come to this conclusion. In 2007, the Supreme Court announced in a major decision that : A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related. In 2009, the EPA formally agreed, announcing that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases endangered public health and welfare by causing global warming. Even the oil companies, who stand to be most harmed by the regulation of greenhouse gases, have come to accept the science. In its official statement on climate change , Exxon Mobil says: \u201cThe risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action. Increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere are having a warming effect.\u201d In its own page on climate change, Shell says : \u201cIn order to prosper while tackling climate change, society needs to provide much more energy for a growing global population while finding ways to emit much less CO2.\u201d Pruitt has previously vacillated on some of these questions. Early last year, he cast doubt on the human origins of climate change, writing in the National Review  that \u201cscientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\u201d Speaking to Congress in January, he moderated those views\u2014somewhat. \u201cScience tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,\u201d he said . \u201cThe human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.\u201d As I noted at the time , this was a carefully crafted line: It seemed to recognize the reality of climate change while undermining the research methods that scientists used to discover it. It remained out of step with scientific consensus, though, because human activity doesn\u2019t just \u201cimpact\u201d contemporary global warming \u201cin some manner.\u201d It is the cause of this climate change. You could even call carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases the \u201cprimary control knob\u201d of the modern-day climate as Kernen did. Already, the Sierra Club has called for Pruitt to resign, alleging that he misled Congress in his testimony about global warming. Some senior U.S. climate and atmospheric scientists have joined their call. In my view, there are more clear cut cases of Pruitt giving false information to Congress: During his hearing, for instance, he told senators that he never used his private email address while conducting state business, even though an Oklahoma City FOX station later revealed that he did . But it hardly matters, because now there will be a great public fight over Pruitt\u2019s comments, and partisans across the country will be asked to take sides. Pruitt\u2019s claim runs so counter to the long-standing, hard-won scientific understanding of the issue that it is not improper to call him a climate-change denier. This won\u2019t be hyperbole: The evidence that CO\u2082 alters the planet\u2019s climate is as critical to the idea of global warming as the evidence showing the planet to be warming in the first place. \u201cPruitt has demonstrated that he is unqualified to run the EPA or any agency,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in a statement responding to Pruitt\u2019s Squawk Box appearance. \u201cThere is no doubt whatsoever that the planet is warming and it is primarily due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels.\u201d And yet, few minds are likely to change as a result of this debate. Many Americans will hear Pruitt\u2019s comments at the same time they hear the scientific community\u2019s response. They will assume that both groups mean well\u2014that their new public servant isn\u2019t lying to them\u2014and they will grasp for a false truth somewhere between the two statements. These Americans will come to assume that there is some debate about climate change, some moderate position between those who say the world is warming and those who say otherwise. These Americans will be intelligent, good-faith, savvy consumers of media\u2014yet they will have been successfully misled. The moderate position between the truth and a falsehood is still a falsehood. It's still incorrect to believe, as Pruitt does, that there is \"tremendous disagreement\" about these issues. The long, grinding fight to convince the public of the reality of global warming will be set back once again.","headline":"Trump's EPA Chief Denies the Basic Science of Climate Change","article_name":519054.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/03\/trumps-epa-chief-rejects-that-carbon-dioxide-emissions-cause-climate-change\/519054\/","date_published":"2017-03-09 19:31:00","article_length":6498,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:29.313192","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/03\/trumps-epa-chief-rejects-that-carbon-dioxide-emissions-cause-climate-change\/519054\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Sea-level rise will become unmanageable, and life will flee the world\u2019s tropical oceans, if carbon pollution keeps rising, a new report from the UN climate panel says. Today a baby girl was born. Consider the years of her life\u2014how she\u2019ll think back to her childhood in the \u201920s (the 2020s) and become a teenager in the \u201930s. If she\u2019s an American citizen, she\u2019ll cast her first vote for president in the 2040 election; she might graduate from college a year or two later. In the year 2050, she\u2019ll turn 31, and she\u2019ll be both fully grown up and young enough to look to the end of the century\u2014and imagine she may get to see it. We hold the fate of that girl\u2014and of the society she inhabits\u2014in our hands. That\u2019s the message of a blockbuster new report , released today, from the United Nations\u2013led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). While the report covers how climate change is reshaping the oceans and ice sheets, its deeper focus is how water , in all its forms, is closely tied to human flourishing. If our water-related problems are relatively easy to manage, then the problem of self-government is also easier. But if we keep spewing carbon pollution into the air, then the resulting planetary upheaval would constitute \u201ca major strike against the human endeavor,\u201d says Michael Oppenheimer , a lead author of the report and a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. \u201cWe can adapt to this problem up to a point,\u201d Oppenheimer told me. \u201cBut that point is determined by how strongly we mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions.\u201d If humanity manages to quickly lower its carbon pollution in the next few decades, then sea-level rise by 2100 may never exceed about one foot, the report says. This will be tough but manageable, Oppenheimer said. But if carbon pollution continues rising through the middle of the century, then sea-level rise by 2100 could exceed 2 feet 9 inches. Then \u201cthe job will be too big,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be an unmanageable problem.\u201d This release concludes a trilogy of special reports from the IPCC. The first came last October , when it warned that even \u201cmoderate\u201d warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius would generate irreparable damage; and the second was published last month, with a summary of how climate change will reshape the planet\u2019s land surface . After this new report, the IPCC will fall silent until 2021, when it will publish its sixth major assessment of climate science. In other words, the IPCC\u2014whose recent reports have overthrown the climate conversation both in the United States and around the world\u2014will publish nothing new until after the 2020 presidential election. The headline finding of this report is that sea-level rise could be worse than we thought. The report\u2019s projection of worst-case sea-level rise by 2100 is about 10 percent higher than the IPCC predicted five years ago. The IPCC has been steadily ratcheting up its sea-level-rise projections since its 2001 report, and it is likely to increase the numbers further in the 2021 report, when the IPCC runs a new round of global climate models. Read: Are we living through climate change\u2019s worst-case scenario? But sea-level rise is only one of the bewildering consequences of climate change listed in the report, whose view stretched \u201cfrom the highest mountains to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d according to Ko Barrett , a vice chair of the IPCC and a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What\u2019s clear is that climate change is going to reshape every system made of water on Earth. That means that as the ocean warms, seafood safety will decline: Mercury will accumulate in fish, and the toxic bacteria Vibrio  will become more common. And climate change will sicken people. In the Arctic, where indigenous people rely on seafood diets, food- and waterborne illnesses are already increasing. Climate change will also prompt extreme coastal-flooding events\u2014think of Hurricane Harvey or Katrina\u2014to surge in frequency. Floods that used to happen every century will now happen, in some places, every year. It will push the worst rainstorms, including tropical cyclones and hurricanes, to dump even more water. And it will increase the frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events like the \u201cmonster El Ni\u00f1o\u201d that struck in 2016. This threatens to induce intense \u201cwhiplash between wet and dry periods,\u201d Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin, told me. At the same time, climate change\u2019s effects seem to be speeding up. The seas are now rising at a pace \u201cunprecedented over the last century,\u201d the report warns. The rate of global sea-level rise was 2.5 times faster from 2006 to 2016 than it was for nearly all of the 20th century. \u201cIn the Antarctic ice sheet, the rate of mass loss had tripled relative to the previous decade,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cIn Greenland, it\u2019s doubled over the past decade.\u201d The oceans act like a massive sponge in the planetary system, and they have so far absorbed most of the warmth trapped by greenhouse gases. Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled. Marine heat waves\u2014when the ocean becomes so hot that it can kill plants and animals\u2014happen twice as frequently now, and they have grown in intensity, duration, and size. This is prompting invisible bonfires to break out across the ocean\u2019s most pristine environments. Tropical coral reefs contain most of the ocean\u2019s biodiversity: They are the so-called rainforests of the ocean. Yet they are dying more surely than the Amazon in Brazil. \u201cAlmost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d the IPCC writes. From 2016 to 2018, half the coral in the Great Barrier Reef died, Australia\u2019s lead coral scientist told me last year . It will take at least 15 years to recover\u2014and given the pace and spread of marine heat waves, it probably never will. A child born today in Australia may never know the Great Barrier Reef as an adult. That is not a hyperbolic statement; that is an assessment of the facts. Even beyond reefs, life is fleeing the tropical ocean. Since the 1950s, entire populations of fish and seafloor creatures have moved toward the poles at a rate of up to 50 miles a decade. This is an incredible figure when you consider that it is unplanned, unorganized, and unhabitual: The population is relocating itself all at once. Read: Seven ways to understand the IPCC\u2019s warning about climate change and land And this ecological upheaval of climate change is not limited to the seas. \u201cMany glaciers, particularly in Washington State and the Mountain West, will disappear within the next decade and\u2014at the latest\u2014within a century,\u201d said Regine Hock , an author of the report and a geophysicist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, at a press conference this week. That has implications for water security across huge portions of the American West: Phoenix and Los Angeles both rely, to some extent, on water from mountain glaciers. There are two immense stores of water on the planet. The first, covering more than two-thirds of its surface, are the oceans. The second, blanketing the poles, are the rocklike ice caps. (Hence the pithy observation, beloved by some oceanographers, that we call our home world \u201cEarth\u201d only out of a kind of species-level vanity. It would be far more accurate to call it \u201cSea . \u201d) It\u2019s not common, across Earth\u2019s history, for ice to sit on the surface as a permanent presence. It\u2019s happened only three times in the past 550 million years, the same time period that complex, multicellular life has ruled the surface. It denotes that we are living in an Ice Age, scientifically, even if glaciers are not choking off Manhattan. The entire span of the human species has happened in an Ice Age. It\u2019s an open question of whether climate change will end the one we are currently in. But we can already detect one key change in how those two stores of water interrelate. For decades, the biggest driver of sea-level rise was heat itself, because as the ocean gets hotter, it literally takes up more space. (Scientists call this principle \u201cthermal expansion,\u201d and it applies to matter more generally: You demonstrate it at home whenever you run a jar under hot water to loosen the lid.) But in the past few years, meltwater from Greenland and Antarctica has overwhelmed this effect. Oceans are rising today primarily because they have more water in them. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying all along that ice sheets would become dominant, and that signal is starting to appear,\u201d Dutton said. (Dutton is having a busy week: She won a MacArthur genius grant this morning.) And while this is a dramatic change, there\u2019s a question in the middle of the report that portends an even more cataclysmic event. Hanging over the report, like an icy Damocletian saber, dangles the question: Will the Antarctic ice sheet collapse? Read: After decades of losing ice, Antarctica is now hemorrhaging it In 1978, the glaciologist John Mercer issued a warning in the scientific journal Nature . If people kept burning fossil fuels at the present rate, he wrote, then within 50 years they could set off the \u201crapid deglaciation\u201d of West Antarctica. The process he identified\u2014called \u201cmarine ice-sheet instability\u201d\u2014has haunted climate scientists for the past four decades. Mercer\u2019s problem begins with a simple fact: Ice floats in water. Many glaciers in West Antarctica have \u201cwet feet,\u201d as Dutton put it, meaning their front face sits in the water. Just like ice in a water glass, these glaciers want to float. But they don\u2019t. The weight of the ice above the waterline keeps the entire glacier stuck to the seafloor. But as it gets farther from the ocean, the bedrock of West Antarctica slopes downhill. If the glacier were to start retreating, then more and more of its mass would fall below the waterline. Eventually, the mass above the waterline would no longer keep the glacier stuck to the seafloor. The glacier would float off its foundation, the ice floe behind it would quickly spill out into the sea, and the glacier would quickly become so many melting ice cubes. Once this process starts, it\u2019s irreversible. It has never been observed\u2014because we\u2019ve never observed wrenching global climate change before. But since about 2006, more and more evidence has suggested that Mercer\u2019s process is real and has happened in the past, Oppenheimer said. And just in the past decade, glaciologists have added another potentially irreversible process to the mix, called \u201cmarine ice-cliff instability.\u201d Its proponents argue that ice is structurally unstable. As West Antarctic glaciers retreat, their ice fronts could eventually tower so high above the bedrock that they would crumple under their own weight. While this hypothesis is far more recent , this glacial brittle collapse would further accelerate the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Right now, the IPCC authors believe that the Antarctic ice sheet probably won\u2019t collapse. But that is not exactly reassuring. Some measurements suggest that the ice sheet is already unstable. And the IPCC is clear that if Antarctica\u2019s glaciers do begin to disintegrate, then its projections about future \u201clikely\u201d sea-level rise will be far too small. If Antarctica totally collapses, then it could loose 13 feet of sea-level rise into the ocean, at a rate of more than three feet a century, Oppenheimer said. This scenario, he added, \u201cis unmanageable.\u201d We don\u2019t know how much climate change might trigger runaway collapse\u2014but generally, the less carbon pollution, the better. \u201cIf there\u2019s a threshold out there, we\u2019re much better landing in 1.5-degree-Celsius trajectory,\u201d Oppenheimer said. What\u2019s crucial is that decisions about these pathways are being made now ; the little girl\u2019s future is being locked in, even as we speak. In the United States, President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to repeal virtually every climate regulation is nudging us toward the higher, more disastrous path, and making climate action more expensive for other countries. \u201cThis [report] drives home the message that policies that curb greenhouse gases today can have a strong effect on future sea-level rise, particularly in terms of what happens after 2050,\u201d Dutton said. We cannot abandon this Ice Age without risking a new, and far more dangerous, epoch.","headline":"The Oceans We Know Won\u2019t Survive Climate Change","article_name":598765.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/09\/ipcc-sea-level-rise-report\/598765\/","date_published":"2019-09-25 14:16:26","article_length":12354,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:30.127974","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/09\/ipcc-sea-level-rise-report\/598765\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"The country now has a suite of buildings that generate more energy than they use. The European Union has a target of making all new buildings zero-energy by 2020, but in Norway, carbon neutrality isn\u2019t enough. A consortium in Oslo made up of architects, engineers, environmentalists, and designers is creating energy-positive buildings in a country with some of the coldest and darkest winters on Earth. \u201cIf you can make it in Norway, you can make it anywhere,\u201d says Peter Bernhard, a consultant with Asplan Viak, one of the Powerhouse alliance members. Bernhard says Powerhouse began in 2010 with a question: Is it possible to not only eliminate the carbon footprint of buildings, but to also use them as a climate-crisis solution? It was a lofty goal. According to the European Commission , buildings account for 40 percent of energy usage and 36 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions in the EU. But after undertaking several energy-positive projects\u2014building a new Montessori school, retrofitting four small office buildings, building a few homes, and breaking ground on two new office buildings\u2014Powerhouse has found the answer to the 2010 question to be an emphatic \u201cYes.\u201d In 2019, the collective\u2019s biggest project to date will open to the public: Powerhouse Bratt\u00f8rkaia , in the central Norwegian city of Trondheim. Bratt\u00f8rkaia is an eight-story office building that will produce 485,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. For reference, the average Norwegian home uses about 20,000 kWh of power a year. (In the United States, the yearly household average is 10,399 kWh ). Bratt\u00f8rkaia will, in effect, become a mini power plant that can supply electricity to Norway\u2019s publicly owned grid. Its surplus energy will also compensate for the power used to produce its building materials. That, says the Sn\u00f8hetta architect Jette Hopp, is unique; prevailing definitions for energy-positive buildings don\u2019t include materials\u2019 embodied energy. Hopp says accounting for that energy makes for a more complex development process. Recycled materials are favored above all. New materials are diligently traced. The design process is front-loaded with engineering expertise. Alliance members work together to make sure every design choice has a dual purpose. \u201cNothing is by coincidence,\u201d Hopp says. \u201cWe try to give things multiple functions, and that directly leads to less embodied energy since we don\u2019t have to double or triple up systems. That\u2019s in the smart thinking\u2014but you need to have the knowledge of all the different layers of infrastructure works in order to find synergies.\u201d That meticulousness is apparent at Powerhouse Kj\u00f8rbo. The retrofit project, composed of four short office buildings in a business park outside of Oslo, was the first to be completed by the collective. During September\u2019s Oslo Innovation Week, Bernhard, of Asplan Viak\u2014whose offices are located at Kj\u00f8rbo\u2014gave a detailed tour of one of the buildings. Motion sensors click lights on and off as people move about the building. An internal spiral staircase doubles as a ventilation shaft. Rooftop solar panels collect energy on bright days, energy wells store it, and geothermal power compensates on colder, grayer days. ( Track Kj\u00f8rbo\u2019s performance here .) Read: The solar industry has paid off its carbon debts The building\u2019s concrete frame was recycled, and the old exterior glass windows were reused to make interior partitions, which help maximize daylight. Additional insulation panels were made from old plastic bottles. Rather than use energy-intensive metal, a Japanese wood-burning technique called shou sugi ban was used to blacken Kj\u00f8rbo\u2019s new facade. Prior to refurbishment, the building consumed an average of 250 kWh per square meter, Bernhard says. \u201cThat has been reduced by 85 percent,\u201d he added. Kj\u00f8rbo\u2019s excess energy is used to heat another building and to power a nearby hydrogen-car refueling station. The hope is to make energy-positive neighborhoods next, Bernhard says. Energy-positive construction has piqued other countries\u2019 curiosity\u2014particularly Germany\u2019s\u2014but it still hasn\u2019t had its breakthrough moment. Hopp says that, so far, all of Powerhouse\u2019s requests have come from inside Norway. Sn\u00f8hetta on its own, however, has an international reputation for pairing elements of sustainability\u2014social or environmental\u2014with bold yet rational design. In 2018, the architecture firm finished the retrofit of an old house on Harvard\u2019s Cambridge campus that will serve as a prototype and living laboratory for energy-positive construction. The firm also built an extension of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the pedestrianized revamp of Times Square, Calgary\u2019s new Central Library, Le Monde \u2019s new Paris headquarters , and a building in Toronto entirely dedicated to giving Ryerson University students badly needed study space. Back in Norway, Sn\u00f8hetta and other Powerhouse members are working on the world\u2019s first energy-positive hotel inside of the Arctic Circle. The mock-up for the Svart hotel shows a ring-shaped building jutting out over icy waters, just a few steps away from the Svartisen glacier. In Trondheim, the design of the not-yet-finished Bratt\u00f8rkaia shows a striking building informed by nature. The roof slopes to maximize solar harvesting. A cylindrical atrium through the center of the building brings natural light in from two sides. A slightly curved facade, paired with double-skin glass, captures Nordic winds and repurposes them for ventilation, while also reducing the wind-tunnel effect on the ground. \u201cWe really let the environmental aspects drive the design,\u201d Hopp says. Read: The weird, wooden future of skyscrapers The commitment to social and environmental sustainability is not unique to Powerhouse. Norway is wholly dedicated to reducing carbon-dioxide emissions across the country, with the ultimate goal of decarbonizing transportation altogether. For these efforts, Oslo was elected the 2019 European Green Capital . Powerhouse isn\u2019t the only group dedicated to energy-positive construction; Haptic Architects and the Nordic Office of Architecture are planning an energy-positive airport city for Oslo. Hopp suggests this kind of environment-focused collectivism is partly informed by Norway\u2019s right to roam , a right codified by law that gives all Norwegians the freedom to pitch a tent almost anywhere they want. Hopp says Sn\u00f8hetta has integrated a version of the right to roam\u2014being able to freely walk in, under, or upon a building as a member of the general public\u2014into its work. \u201cWe believe that architecture is one of the most important cultural expressions of our time, and that it also has a social impact,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you have a generous building that is also able to include society, that changes how you perceive cities and the built environment around you\u2014the singular you as well as the plural. It makes a big difference.\u201d This post appears courtesy of CityLab .","headline":"Norway Is Entering a New Era of Climate-Conscious Architecture","article_name":578245.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2018\/12\/norway-energy-positive-buildings\/578245\/","date_published":"2018-12-15 13:00:00","article_length":6911,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:31.017860","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2018\/12\/norway-energy-positive-buildings\/578245\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"If Democrats fail to pass a climate policy, they will all but guarantee that the world will warm a dangerous degree and that the U.S. will surrender its technological advantage to China. I try to avoid despair when writing about climate change. Having covered the topic for five years, I\u2019ve learned that a game of telephone shapes what eventually enters circulation. Case in point: Last week, scientists presented satellite data showing that a floating piece of ice off the coast of Antarctica was beginning to splinter. That is concerning and surprising, but not catastrophic. Yet by the end of the journalistic rinse cycle, the concern had become a threat that the entire ice sheet was on the verge of collapse . And we don\u2019t know that yet. So: I try to avoid despair. But sometimes despair is the right emotion. The United States is on the verge of a massive, history-rewriting failure. On Sunday, Senator Joe Manchin, the Democrats\u2019 linchpin vote, told Fox News that he couldn\u2019t vote for the Build Back Better Act, the vehicle for much of President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative climate policy. If that decision holds, then Manchin has virtually sealed the planet\u2019s fate: The world is all but guaranteed to warm by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above its preindustrial temperature by 2040. But it will also be a tragedy for the United States, which will all but surrender its technological advantage to China. In fact, I am concerned that by passing only the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and not a follow-up climate bill, Manchin and other Democrats are essentially subsidizing Chinese industrial supremacy. If Build Back Better fails, it will be a catastrophe for the Democratic Party too. Biden has argued that only his moderation, his experience, and his institutionalism can relieve the country\u2019s crises. Congressional Democrats followed by electing Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, geriatric pragmatists, to lead the House and the Senate, respectively. If this trio of moderates cannot deliver the goods\u2014if they cannot, despite their decades of yammering, actually succeed in passing what is an aspirational but still insufficient climate law \u2014then the center-left\u2019s case for itself will collapse. The left will argue, more convincingly than ever, that only radicalism and political rupture constitute a sane response to the climate crisis. Some pundits still think of climate policy in the way that it was first sketched in the 1990s: as a service to the world, as fundamentally the right thing to do. A country that adopted climate policy, the idea went, paid a voluntary cost for other countries\u2019 benefit. But this view is incomplete, and it is dangerously out of sync with the events of the past few years. We now know that countries that develop a technology first tend to benefit the most. By acting early, countries help their domestic green-technology sectors\u2014which is to say, their next-generation energy industries\u2014develop a competitive advantage. As the domestic market for green technology grows, the companies serving it improve their products over time, learning to make their gadgets more quickly, cheaply, and efficiently. Then they sell their cheap, superior goods to the world. And China, which Manchin highlights as America\u2019s main global adversary, does not think this way. The country is no climate hero: Last year, its carbon pollution exceeded every wealthy country\u2019s emissions combined. But its leadership has seized on new energy technology anyway, for reasons largely unrelated to climate change. Because of its dependence on Middle Eastern oil and American natural gas, the Chinese government has tried to develop as many energy resources inside its borders as it can. Its years of toxic air pollution have given it a political need, too, to develop as much low-emissions energy as possible. All of these things\u2014the world\u2019s interest, the country\u2019s self-interest\u2014add up to one conclusion: Something has to pass . Some version of a climate bill. Any version of it. What is so frustrating is that the largest disputes over the bill aren\u2019t about climate policy. Instead, they\u2019re about the dozens of social policies in the Build Back Better package. Manchin wants Democratic leaders to pick which of those programs to extend indefinitely. (Because of the Senate procedure used to pass the Build Back Better bill, it must not affect the size of the budget 10 years from now.) Yet so far, Schumer and Pelosi have refused . They have instead phased these programs out over the next decade in the hopes that a future Congress will renew them. Manchin has fumed at this approach, because he says that extending all the programs indefinitely will swell the budget by $4.5 trillion, which is smaller than his own top-line $1.8 trillion figure. We now know that, last week, Manchin proposed a package of exactly that size that includes more than $500 billion in climate spending, according to The Washington Post. The White House was considering how to respond when, according to The Hil l , a tiff broke out over whether Biden could put Manchin\u2019s name in a press release, of all things. (I don\u2019t get that part either.) But if, like me, you believe that Biden must pass climate policy during this particular moment in time\u2014when we can detect climate change but still act on it before it becomes irreversible\u2014then it\u2019s almost self-evident that Democrats should have taken this deal, and should do their best to get it back on the table, if it\u2019s not already. If you believe what Democrats say about climate change, then virtually any social policy, including the child tax credit, is worth sacrificing so that decarbonization can become law. There is an instinct among some progressives that Biden should cut his losses here and jump to executive action. This is horrible advice. It might do something, but it would not be enough. Models from the Princeton ZERO Lab show that Biden\u2019s goal of cutting U.S. carbon pollution in half by 2030 (compared with its all-time high) will be far easier if Congress passes climate legislation. Any deal that Democrats can reach will strengthen their ability to pass climate-focused rules later\u2014because when the federal government uses its power to make things cheaper \u2026 they\u2019re cheaper. This matters for federal rule-making because, since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, every new federal regulation has had to pass a cost-benefit analysis; that is, a federal agency must show that a proposed rule\u2019s estimated costs, as measured in dollars, are smaller than its estimated benefits, in dollars. If the federal government is planning to spend money to subsidize climate-friendly technology, that lowers the estimated costs of adopting a more aggressive rule. So if Congress subsidizes the cost of electric home-heating appliances, then the Department of Energy will be able to pass more stringent efficiency rules for them. If it subsidizes electric-vehicle purchases, then the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s tailpipe-pollution rules can get more stringent. Because of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the U.S. is about to go on a research-spending spree. (Manchin gestures to this in his argument against Build Back Better, and on the facts at least, he\u2019s right.) R&D is fantastic, and conventional economists are correct to frame it as a public good , a blessing to society that the government can and should fund. But pure research gets us only so far. And if the United States is not careful\u2014if it does not create a market for the new ideas that it generates\u2014then every new technology that its R&D discovers will slip through its fingers. America used to be good at both developing new ideas and converting them into products. The car, the airplane, the computer\u2014in the 20th century, Americans invented key technologies underpinning these and then successfully commercialized them. The United States is an innovation leader: The world envies our classrooms, universities, and national labs; our government scientists and publicly funded professors develop the ideas, materials, and approaches that dictate the frontier of knowledge. But it is not actually a technological leader. (Is there a single appliance in your house that you can say, with any certainty, rolled off an American assembly line and improves your life? Not your computer or cellphone. Not your microwave.) This is because it cannot translate its ideas into products. It cannot convert its world-class research into marketable goods that will actually sell. As I\u2019ve written, U.S.-funded research at U.S. labs produced the first solar panel, in the 1950s. But the U.S. government declined to develop a market for solar technology, and by the 1980s it was Japanese firms, not American firms, that had successfully brought solar panels to market . As Nikos Tsafos, the James Schlesinger Chair of Energy and Geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recently wrote , the U.S. fails to develop markets for its innovations. This is what happened with solar panels. It is what is happening now with semiconductors. And it is what will happen to the breakthrough innovations that the bipartisan infrastructure bill creates. How to avoid that fate? We need, first, federal agencies that know that their job is to seed new innovations into the public sector. But we also need public policy that guarantees demand for new technologies. We need the type of tax credits, purchase guarantees, and subsidies funded in the Build Back Better bill to help assure entrepreneurs that a market exists for any new innovations that they would translate into products. We need policies like Manchin\u2019s 48C tax credit , which incentivizes companies to place advanced-energy factories in rural areas. These are all policies funded in the Build Back Better bill. The country is as close as it\u2019s been in decades to patching up its innovation-to-market pipeline. Democrats must seal it. It\u2019s time to pass a bill or destroy the party trying.","headline":"We\u2019re Heading Toward a Very American Climate Tragedy","article_name":621092.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/12\/joe-biden-joe-manchin-climate-deal\/621092\/","date_published":"2021-12-22 14:31:46","article_length":9960,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:31.929161","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/12\/joe-biden-joe-manchin-climate-deal\/621092\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"As a reporter covering the environment, I'm all too aware of what the next 50 years could hold. As a 9-year-old, she's not\u2014and for now, she wants to stay that way. Late last year, a local middle-school teacher asked me to talk to her class about my work as a science journalist. When the appointed afternoon arrived, family scheduling conflicts required my young daughter to tag along. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to be talking to these kids about climate change,\u201d I told her in the car. \u201cYou can stay in the classroom and listen, or we can find another place for you to hang out while I talk.\u201d She looked up from her book, one in a labyrinthine series about warring cat clans. \u201cAnother place to hang out,\u201d she said, and returned to her reading. My daughter is 9\u20149 and a half, she would tell you\u2014and she\u2019s curious about many things. She\u2019s curious about dragons and hyenas, prime numbers and royal marriages. She\u2019s curious about robots and religion and race and gender. She wants to know why kids can\u2019t vote; she wants to know if there\u2019s any news about the Mueller investigation. She doesn\u2019t want to know about climate change. Not from me, at least. Not yet. Climate change has been part of my professional life for well over a decade, and part of my personal life for even longer. While I don\u2019t have any illusions that climate change can be averted by individual actions alone, I spent 15 years living off the electrical grid, and for both financial and environmental reasons my family still lives relatively simply. My husband and I deliberated for years about whether to have a child at all, partly because parenting in an affluent society is, shall we say, a carbon-intensive activity, and partly because we knew that future generations will probably have to contend with the consequences of a severely disrupted climate. While my personal ambivalence about parenting is long gone, I understand it in others, and I still worry about what lies ahead for my daughter. My own responses to climate change have, inevitably, affected my daughter. When we lived off the grid, she got so used to explaining to her friends how our composting toilet worked that when she was five, and we moved into a house with a flush toilet, I overheard her showing friends how to push the handle. (They sweetly assured her that they had it sorted.) She knows that her father and I spend money pretty carefully, just like we try to use water and food and paper and power carefully, and while she makes fun of our habits, many of them have become hers, too. But I don\u2019t need to bring up climate change in order to explain why it\u2019s a good idea to save a little water\u2014and in general, I don\u2019t. As a parent, I approach the subject of climate change much like I approach the subject of sex: While I answer all questions, without hesitation and in full, I make sure not to answer more questions than I\u2019m asked. My daughter hears the phrases \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d from others, and she\u2019s asked me what they mean. A kind of pollution, I tell her, that a lot of people are working on fixing. A problem that I\u2019m trying to help other people work out. That satisfies her curiosity, for now. She\u2019s heard her classmates talking about bigger wildfires and rising seas; she\u2019s heard adults joke darkly about \u201cthe end of the world,\u201d and it scares her. When she tells me about her fears, I don\u2019t deny that many of the effects of climate change are scary, but I remind her that people say silly things when they\u2019re scared, even adults. I tell her that the world isn\u2019t going anywhere. My daughter is growing up in a relatively safe place, in a relatively stable climate, and bit by bit she\u2019s learning about the dangers of the world. She\u2019s learned that friends can be mean to each other, that classmates can be struck with life-threatening diseases, that kids her age are having to flee from war and famine. She\u2019s learned, because she\u2019s heard and asked and we\u2019ve told her, that some kids in our country have been shot to death in their own schools. Someday soon, I expect she\u2019ll ask me\u2014or someone else\u2014to tell her more about climate change and what it\u2019s likely to mean for her. But she can choose when and how much to ask. Too many of the climate-change education materials I see deprive kids of that choice. Often, they focus on how to explain climate change: They suggest that teachers use a houseplant to introduce the carbon cycle, or invite an older member of the community to visit the class and talk about the climate changes he or she has observed over a lifetime. They use age-appropriate vocabulary and activities to introduce the concepts of scientific uncertainty and civic engagement. Since climate change is usually tackled in science class, these materials are often written by scientists, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re primarily concerned with translating the science of climate change. But as a parent, and as a climate-change communicator, I\u2019d like to see these materials spend more time on when and why teachers ought to discuss climate change in class. When are kids ready\u2014both intellectually and emotionally\u2014to learn about an abstract, global problem that may affect their future in very tangible, often disturbing ways? And what, exactly, do we want kids to learn from their first lessons about climate change? When we explain to elementary-school students why the sea ice is melting and polar bears are starving, are we truly satisfying their curiosity\u2014or are we just sharing our own burdens of worry and responsibility? David Sobel, an environmental educator, spent many years collecting neighborhood maps drawn by children in the U.S., England, and the Caribbean. These hundreds of maps, he reports, show a clear pattern: Kids between the ages of 4 and 7 put their homes at the center of their maps, often dominating the page. Kids ages 8 to 11 move their homes to the margins, focusing instead on what Sobel calls the \u201cexplorable landscape\u201d\u2014woods, neighborhoods, and other spaces that are within reach, but yet unknown. Kids 12 to 15 draw maps that are larger in scope and more abstract, but still anchored in familiar, often social places. \u201cAt each of these stages, children desire immersion, solitude, and interaction in a close, knowable world,\u201d Sobel writes . As a parent, I\u2019ve learned that kids usually tell us, or show us, when they\u2019re ready to expand that world. When my daughter is ready to set out into the unknown territory of climate change, I trust she\u2019ll let me know. During our recent middle-school visit, my daughter and I found a hallway nook where she could read. The kids in the classroom I visited were three and four years older than she is, and they were studying the causes and effects of a recent nearby wildfire\u2014a huge, drought-fueled fire that had choked the town with smoke for weeks, and forced some students to evacuate their homes. With the help of their teacher and a local arts grant, they were making a short film about the fire, and in the spring they would talk with students in Hawaii and Alaska who were at work on similar projects. As I talked to them about my own work, they squirmed, and laughed, and tipped their chairs at risky angles, and every so often they looked serious, because climate change is a serious thing. But they could barely contain their questions. In the years between my daughter\u2019s age and theirs, climate change had become part of their explorable landscape\u2014and they were ready to face it.","headline":"How I Talk to My Daughter About Climate Change","article_name":554969.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2018\/04\/raising-kids-climate-change\/554969\/","date_published":"2018-04-05 15:22:02","article_length":7436,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:32.265954","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2018\/04\/raising-kids-climate-change\/554969\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Warming could be a winning issue, but President Obama isn't pushing on it -- and experts finger one of his top aides as the culprit. \"It was always going to be the case that whenever the visible reality of climate change became so painfully obvious that you couldn't deny it any more, that it was going to flip over to a winning issue. The question was: When was that going to happen?\" So said Joseph Romm , the former Clinton energy official and popular blogger behind Climate Progress , at the first Climate Desk Live briefing at the Mott House on Capitol Hill. Romm and his fellow panelists -- strategist Betsy Taylor of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions and consultant Paul Bledsoe , who worked in the Clinton White House on climate communications -- were in strong agreement that the weather of the last year has transformed climate change into the type of issue that could impact the 2012 election , simply because most Americans now feel directly affected by it. That emphatically includes independents and swing voters . \"One of the problems with climate change is it's always been distant and remote. This year's weather made it immediate,\" Taylor explained. She showed previously unpublished data from a Harstad Strategic Research survey from May of 2012, showing that 59 percent of Americans agreed that the weather in their area had gotten more extreme or unpredictable over the past several years -- and 68 percent agreed that the weather was more volatile than it was during their childhood. But while national polls may show that the climate issue appeals to independents, the campaign is being fought in a small number of battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and so on. At the briefing, the question arose whether the campaigns may have more detailed and granular analyses, suggesting that the issue won't actually help them in these critical swing states. Could that explain why they're ignoring climate? The panel was having none of it. If anything, Bledsoe argued, many of the 2012 swing states ought to be better places for climate messaging, in light of the extreme weather they've experienced. \"Colorado and New Mexico are two swing states that have experienced extreme wildfires,\" he pointed out. And \"Florida is on the cutting edge of climate change for a whole variety of reasons, not the least of which, extreme weather but also sea-level rise.\" \"We're reaching now the point where almost every state is getting some sort of extreme weather event that is off the charts, including that derecho that ripped across the country and went into Virginia,\" Romm added. He cited a recent poll from Yale University and George Mason University researchers, breaking down concern about global warming by U.S. regions. In the Midwest, for instance, the perception that droughts are getting more common has shot up 25 percentage points since March, to 66 percent. So why, then, aren't politicians like President Obama taking up climate change messaging to win votes? Taylor said that following the economic collapse of 2008, this was a more or less a conscious strategy. \"By the spring of 2009, with the fiscal crisis, there was a decision made, and adopted, not to talk about climate change,\" she related. \"That was adopted by the majority of the environmental groups, and by the White House. I was at that meeting. Bill McKibben stood up and said, 'This is a mistake -- it's going to come back and haunt us.'\" Talking about clean-energy jobs was fine, she continued. But the \"C-word\" was a no-go. Romm went further. Asked if there was some individual giving politicians bad strategic advice, he commented, \"I will absolutely blame someone. Because I have relatively high confidence, based on conversations I've had, that David Axelrod is the guy who shut down a lot of this talk. And even went up to the Hill and told the Dems not to message the climate science.\" Bledsoe added that the scarring experience of failing to pass the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in Congress probably led many Democrats to back away from the issue. All three panelists agreed that while extreme weather gets Americans to care about climate change, if no solution is offered, people feel overwhelmed, and ultimately fatalistic. The way to get past this, explained Taylor, is to talk about the strength of American ingenuity, and its ability to solve the problem of global warming through new clean energy technologies. In the polling data she presented, 84 percent of Democrats found such a message convincing, as did 61 percent of independents -- even 46 percent of Republicans. For a long time, Americans viewed their shared purpose as \"protecting the free world,\" Bledsoe elaborated. Taking on the climate change could inspire people to think once again about \"what makes America great, what makes it special.\" It can \"tap into the notion of American exceptionalism and American greatness. But not if politicians don't take get past the notion that climate change is a political loser. Such thinking has been refuted by a wave of new data , sampling both national and local audiences. Now, the issue simply awaits its political champion.","headline":"Is David Axelrod to Blame for Climate Change's Absence From the Election?","article_name":263704.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/10\/is-david-axelrod-to-blame-for-climate-changes-absence-from-the-election\/263704\/","date_published":"2012-10-16 19:01:05","article_length":5162,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:33.501542","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/10\/is-david-axelrod-to-blame-for-climate-changes-absence-from-the-election\/263704\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"There\u2019s no magic bill waiting in the wings\u2014and no quick path to arriving at one. There\u2019s a wrinkle in how the United States talks about climate change in 2017, a tension fundamental to the issue\u2019s politics but widely ignored. On the one hand, Democrats are the party of climate change. Since the 1990s, as public belief in global warming has become strongly polarized, the Democratic Party has emerged as the advocate of more aggressive climate action. The most recent Democratic president made climate policy a centerpiece of his second term, and the party\u2019s national politicians now lament and oppose the undoing of his work. Concern for the climate isn\u2019t just an elite issue, either: Rank-and-file Democrats are more likely to worry about global warming than the median voter. On the other hand, the Democratic Party does not have a plan to address climate change. This is true at almost every level of the policy-making process: It does not have a consensus bill on the issue waiting in the wings; it does not have a shared vision for what that bill could look like; and it does not have a guiding slogan\u2014like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d\u2014to express how it wants to stop global warming. Many people in the party know that they want to do something about climate change, but there\u2019s no agreement about what that something may be. This is not for lack of trying. Democrats have struggled to formulate a post-Obama climate policy because substantive political obstacles stand in their way. They have not yet identified a mechanism that will make a dent in Earth\u2019s costly, irreversible warming while uniting the many factions of their coalition. These problems could keep the party scrambling to face the climate crisis for years to come. The roots of this crisis go back to 2009, when Democrats held unified control of the White House and Congress. The end of the last decade was a unique moment in climate politics: Thanks to a string of intense hurricane years, and the unexpected success of Al Gore\u2019s documentary An Inconvenient Truth, public support for addressing climate change through legislation was higher than it had ever been. Democrats responded with the American Clean Energy and Security Act, widely known as \u201cWaxman-Markey,\u201d after its two sponsors, Congressmen Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts. The bill proposed creating a carbon-emissions trading market across the United States. Under its terms, the government would have distributed a number of \u201cright to emit carbon\u201d credits to companies, which they could then have bought and sold to each other. As the years passed, the government would allot fewer credits, forcing the price of emitting carbon to increase, which would\u2014in theory\u2014ultimately decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Though more than a little technical, a pollution market was a proven idea in U.S. environmental law: George H.W. Bush established a similar \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system during his presidency to reduce the pollutants that create acid rain. In June 2009, Waxman-Markey passed the House. But as that summer wore on, the bill\u2019s prospects floundered. By August, the Tea Party rose to command more media attention, and public opinion turned against Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2014focused on passing what would become the Affordable Care Act\u2014declined to take the climate bill to the Senate floor. By the middle of the next summer, Waxman-Markey was effectively dead . Only a few years after it opened, the window to pass climate legislation had already shut. Even in defeat, Waxman-Markey cost the party dearly. More than two dozen congressional Democrats who had supported the cap-and-trade bill lost in the 2010 midterm election. The casualties included Rick Boucher, a 14-term veteran of Congress whose district included much of southwest Virginia\u2019s coal country. Boucher had negotiated concessions for local coal companies into Waxman-Markey, but this could not save his seat. Ten House Democrats, including Boucher, voted for Waxman-Markey and against the Affordable Care Act. Six of them lost their seats in 2010. Indeed, Democrats seemed to prevail only when they ran against the climate bill. Joe Manchin, then the Democratic governor of West Virginia, won a special election that year to serve in the Senate, but only after he ran an ad that showed him shooting a pile of paper with a rifle. \u201cI sued EPA, and I\u2019ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill,\u201d he said in the commercial , which received wide media coverage. So Waxman-Markey failed. And then, freed from a unified campaign, American progressives took climate policy in two different directions. First, the Obama administration pressed ahead with its plans to use the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide. (This power predated his presidency: In 2007, the Supreme Court told the EPA it must consider regulating greenhouse gases under that law.) This push eventually produced the Clean Power Plan in 2015, a set of rules meant to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector by 30 percent from their historic peak. Though it dominated press coverage of Obama\u2019s climate policy, the Clean Power Plan never actually took effect. In February 2016, the Supreme Court blocked it from gaining the force of law . But the administration got many other rules aimed at drawing down carbon pollution on the books by the end of Obama\u2019s term. Second, a swath of environmentalists abandoned the hope of passing climate legislation and returned to a more grassroots, project-by-project approach. Instead of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions through law, these activists hoped to deprive oil companies of their social license to operate altogether. Chief among these new groups was 350.org, led by the author Bill McKibben. 350 opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, a mega-infrastructure project that linked the Canadian tar sands to U.S. export terminals, warning its completion would spell \u201cgame over for the climate.\u201d  In 2010, the Sierra Club also began to use environmental litigation and public pressure to shut down hundreds of coal-burning power plants as part of its Beyond Coal campaign. This climate antagonism was one aspect of the left\u2019s general resurgence during this period. Inspired in part by Naomi Klein\u2019s 2014 book This Changes Everything , many activists came to see climate change as one more symptom of a dehumanized and extractive capitalism. These two sides even had something of a proxy battle during the 2016 Democratic primary. During that race, Hillary Clinton opposed a carbon tax and endorsed the Obama administration\u2019s ongoing regulatory efforts. Sanders endorsed a carbon tax and called for more aggressive investment in climate mitigation. Unlike Clinton\u2019s policies, Sanders would surely have required a Democratic Congress to enshrine his policies. In some ways, though, the 2016 primary was an imperfect battleground for climate policy. Sanders did not seek an energy economist\u2019s ideal climate policy. He wedded climate-hawk positions\u2014like his opposition to natural-gas fracking\u2014to the 1970s\u2019 classically green opposition to nuclear power. (Even though his proposed carbon tax would have been the greatest boon to the nuclear-power industry in decades, as nuclear plants emit no greenhouse gases.) And there likely would have been little substantive policy difference between either candidate\u2019s presidency, at least at first. Had Clinton or Sanders won the election, their EPA would have dutifully defended the Clean Power Plan in court. And their administration would have benefited from one more liberal seat on the Supreme Court to help enshrine more aggressive climate protections into law. But Trump won. And that brings us to the present. On October 10, Scott Pruitt formally repealed the Clean Power Plan, the first phase of a planned disembowelment of Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. Pruitt is not assured to succeed in this effort. Many environmental lawyers argue that his legal arguments are not particularly well-supported . To push his repeal through, Pruitt had to muck with the EPA\u2019s internal cost-benefit calculations. His EPA changed how it estimates the social harms of carbon dioxide, calculating a number more than 50 times smaller than what the Obama administration used; it also changed how it values the threat that air pollution poses to the American public. It may all be for naught. Some environmentalists argue that the Clean Power Plan already accomplished its main goal, which was sending an anti-coal price signal to utility managers. Michael Bloomberg, a UN special climate envoy and the former New York mayor, has argued that the falling cost of renewable energy and the availability of cheap, bountiful natural gas will help the United States meet its carbon-reduction goals even without the federal policy. But Pruitt does not need to win a total victory to succeed. The Clean Power Plan repeal will now be litigated in court, with the EPA lobbying on the side of deregulation. The fight will last years. It may even wind up in front of a Supreme Court more conservative than it is now. No one knows the future, but it\u2019s not hard to sketch possibilities. Pruitt may very well secure a ruling that effectively keeps the Clean Air Act from ever regulating greenhouse gases. Even if he fails, a future Trump EPA may succeed in permanently limiting the law\u2019s regulatory power. And when a climate-concerned Democrat next enters the White House, whether in 2020, 2024, or 2028, he or she may find that the Obama administration\u2019s main policy implement for fighting carbon emissions has been dulled into uselessness. Attorneys at some future EPA will, at that point, probably improvise some new way to address climate change in regulation. They will have no other choice. But there will likely be a need, too, for new legislation. What will Democrats do? Democrats face at least three major problems in trying to formulate a climate policy. First, the relationship between environmentalists and labor groups has disintegrated since 2009. Once upon a time, unions widely supported Waxman-Markey. The bill funded assistance for workers put out of work during the transition away from fossil fuels and launched \u201cgreen-job\u201d retraining programs. It also provided tens of billions in funding for \u201ccarbon capture and sequestration,\u201d an experimental technology that would possibly have allowed coal plants to keep running. But when it failed, the pan-Democratic consensus fell apart with it. Neither of the two climate strategies that have succeeded Waxman-Markey offer particular appeal to organized labor. The Clean Power Plan essentially made nonprofits and already-strapped state budgets (in GOP-governed states) responsible for softening the economic blow of carbon regulation. In large part, they declined. The antagonistic approach to pipelines and other fossil-fuel projects has also alienated labor. Construction-union workers still spend much more time building pipelines than installing renewables. Divorced from a unified legislative campaign\u2014and the promise of federal funding\u2014the new environmental antagonism can seem to run directly counter to worker interests. This isn\u2019t necessarily the fault of the antagonists alone: Unionization in the renewable industry is also lagging. Renewable-energy companies are often as anti-union as any other California-based tech firm. In October, for instance, Tesla\u2014which swears it is trying to hire more employees as fast as it can\u2014fired 400 to 700 workers in what many analysts understood as a union-busting move. United Auto Workers has filed a complaint with the National Labor-Relations Board. Green-energy companies don\u2019t only harbor an anti-regulatory, Silicon Valley\u2013style dislike for organized labor. They also see themselves as fighting a desperate battle on price with oil and gas companies. Every cent the union might add to production cost, they argue, is a cent that disadvantages them against fossil fuels. The green-labor breakdown is the party\u2019s biggest political obstacle. But its second problem is that Democratic voters still don\u2019t care about climate change very much. Like other Americans, most of the party\u2019s electorate experience it as a \u201clow-intensity\u201d issue. Though a majority of Americans in every state believe in climate change, very few people use climate policy to decide whom to vote for. Even Democrats say that a candidate\u2019s proposed climate policy matters less when making a voting decision than his or her proposed policies about jobs, health care, the economy, education, income inequality, and terrorism. As it happens, Trump is helping solve this problem: Due to his steady siege on Obama-era climate policy, he seems to be motivating rank-and-file Democrats to address the issue. His withdrawal from the Paris Agreement was much more unpopular than the treaty itself. But it remains unclear whether the passage of climate policy motivates its supporters more than it aggravates and alienates the issue\u2019s \u201canti-constituency\u201d (such as coal and oil workers). Finally, dealing with climate change through any policy is just hard . Most of the good news in climate change lately has come from the power sector, where emissions have dropped by 18 percent over the last five years . But electricity production only makes up about 29 percent of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. For the United States to decarbonize\u2014which even the newest and most optimistic projections say must proceed at a historically unprecedented pace\u2014it must also tackle carbon pollution from other sectors. Those other sectors will be tougher to crack. Most of the emissions from the transportation sector (which itself makes up more than a quarter of U.S. greenhouse-gas pollution) come from cars and trucks. In order to draw those emissions down by 2050, consumers will have to opt in to electric vehicles en masse and service stations will have to erect electric chargers across the country. Analysts say that\u2019s unlikely to occur without large public investment. And there are few ideas about how to tackle the 21 percent of U.S. emissions that come from the industrial and manufacturing sector. These questions are more pressing than they seem. Eighteen months from now, Democratic policy advisers will meet to develop their chosen candidate\u2019s primary policies. If Democrats win unified control of Congress and the White House in, say, 2020, history suggests they will get a sliver of time to commit any kind of new policy to statute before public opinion turns against them. During that window, dozens of issues will compete for law makers\u2019 attention. In that light, consider how Democrats have treated health care over the past 10 months. While there\u2019s no party-wide consensus, small groups of voters around the country have organized around the issue, calling their senators every day for months. More than a third of Democratic senators have supported a bill to introduce a single national health insurer. And Bernie Sanders, the party\u2019s 2020 frontrunner, has debated Trumpcare (in its many forms) on CNN several times. In sum, many Democrats have coalesced around a single phrase (if not quite a policy to accompany it) and promised to deliver it the next time they\u2019re in power. And even if some Democrats see \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as a base play\u2014as a slogan more likely to be deployed in Vermont than Colorado\u2014it remains a policy-focused promise about future governance. The party has similar promises for other issues, too: On immigration, it can promise the DREAM Act ; on LGBT rights, the Equality Act . I suspect that many voters (including most rank-and-file Democrats) believe that there\u2019s a similar strategy on climate change. They think there\u2019s some bill waiting in the wings that would address the issue. They trust that Democrats have a legislative plan to resolve climate crisis, and that the party only needs to be granted control of Congress to pass it. But nothing of a similar scale exists, and some of the Senate\u2019s most vocal Democrats on the issue resist formulating one. Sheldon Whitehouse, who delivers a weekly climate-themed haranguing on the Senate floor, recently told Vox \u2019s Jeff Stein that way to politically solve global warming is to convert Republicans to the cause. There are only two bills that come close to serving as a flagship bill. The first is the 100 by \u201950 Act , released in April by Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201c100 by \u201950\u201d is an ambitious economic-planning package that would require 100 percent of American electricity to come from clean or renewable energy by 2050. The bill\u2019s release was timed to the People\u2019s Climate March in Washington, D.C. , and McKibben attended its unveiling. It represents the triumph of the 350.org wing of the environmental movement, blocking future fossil-fuel investment and directing plenty of funding to help historically at-risk and marginalized communities. But the 100 by \u201950 Act debuted to a fizzle and Sanders, its more prominent cosponsor, spends little time discussing it publicly. The only other bill is Merkley\u2019s the Keep It in the Ground Act , which would prohibit new oil and gas leases on federal lands. Though cosponsored by Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren, it receives little attention beyond Merkley\u2019s own press statements. Labor sources have also told me that both of these bills would face problems if Democrats tried to run with them. By design, the \u201c100 by \u201950\u201d Act includes no economy-wide mechanism to phase down carbon emissions, like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade market. (Many of the more leftist environmentalist leaders reject these arrangement as failed technocratic policies.) Indeed, most Democrats told me that climate change could only make it to the legislative docket through some other kind of bill. The days of a Waxman-Markey climate-only bill are seen to have passed, but it\u2019s possible that climate could be addressed in a tax or jobs bill. If Republicans succeed in overhauling the U.S. tax code, then Democrats could slide a carbon tax into a progressive rewrite of the system. Aging Reaganite Republicans proposed just such a carbon tax-and-rebate scheme earlier this year. Such a policy would bump up the cost of gas by several dozen cents per gallon, discouraging carbon pollution (in theory)\u2014but it would also send every American family a check for $1,500 four times a year. In the eyes of its supporters, this would reduce carbon emissions while also testing an anti-poverty universal basic income. Democrats could also institute a carbon tax that funds renewable-energy development, as Vox\u2019s Dave Roberts has proposed and as some national polling supports . Some economists worry that such a mechanism would be less politically durable at the national level. Or Democrats could choose another route and pass a \u201cgreen jobs and infrastructure\u201d law that subsidizes renewable-energy construction across the country. They could underwrite the electrification of steel production and impose an import tariff on Chinese steel. They could also compel renewable companies to respect unionization drives\u2014a feasible goal, since the short-term success of the solar and wind industry depends in large part on Democratic victories. The party could do any of these things. But a glance around the infrastructure of the Democratic establishment reveals that little of this planning work is actually getting done. There is no consensus about whether a carbon tax is a good idea. There is no ideal policy embraced by Democrats in lieu of a carbon price. There is, as far as I could find, no think tank putting a bill together or thinking through legislative language. I could barely find professional Democrats planning how a future offensive on the issue would look. Meanwhile, as Kate Aronoff writes at The Intercept , climate change has come to dominate headlines in the past few months like never before. Three historic hurricanes have wreaked havoc across the United States, leaving the worst blackout in American history (which, at writing, is ongoing). Wildfires have destroyed neighborhoods across the West. And 2017 is almost certain to be the second-hottest year ever measured. Against this background, the Trump administration has waged an assault on environmental policy and science with little precedent in U.S. history. In response to this, the Democrats have admonished Trump, have lamented the downfall of Obama-era policy, and have sworn their allegiance to the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals\u2014but have promised no substantive alternative. Waxman-Markey is dead, and the Clean Power Plan is writhing on the floor. What\u2019s next, Democrats?","headline":"Democrats Are Shockingly Unprepared to Fight Climate Change","article_name":543981.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/there-is-no-democratic-plan-to-fight-climate-change\/543981\/","date_published":"2017-11-15 13:00:00","article_length":20665,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:34.135007","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/there-is-no-democratic-plan-to-fight-climate-change\/543981\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Sanders\u2019 new platform envisions steeper long-term carbon cuts and tougher auto mileage rules than Obama has pledged. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t join the Democratic Senate delegation that just visited the global climate talks in Paris, where the 10 lawmakers tried to publicly reassure other nations that Republicans don\u2019t have the political muscle to unwind President Obama\u2019s carbon-cutting pledges. But that hardly means the challenger to front-runner Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to be heard as the talks to craft an accord head into their final stages this week. Sanders\u2019 campaign has unveiled a wide-ranging climate-change platform . The document\u2014a blend of policy and polemic\u2014is stuffed with reminders that he\u2019s among Capitol Hill\u2019s most aggressive advocates of slashing carbon emissions, even if that record wasn\u2019t enough to win the support of the major green group that backed Clinton last month. One somewhat minor section of the plan actually name-checks the Paris deal\u2014or rather, the near-universal acknowledgement that the carbon-emissions-cutting vows of the U.S., China, and other nations in Paris won\u2019t hold the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a benchmark for avoiding the most dangerous levels of climate change. His platform calls the talks an \u201cimportant milestone,\u201d but adds that even if they go well, the summit won\u2019t put the world on a path to avoid the most catastrophic changes. \u201cWe must think beyond Paris. In the first 100 days of Bernie\u2019s presidency, he will convene a summit of the world\u2019s best climate experts to chart a course toward the healthy future we all want for our families and communities,\u201d the plan states, vowing to bring together the \u201cworld\u2019s best engineers, climate scientists, policy experts, activists, and indigenous communities.\u201d The plan, however, goes far beyond a pledge to get people in a room talking. He\u2019s vowing to put in place policies that would slash U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. That\u2019s well beyond Obama\u2019s vow in international climate talks to ensure policies that cut emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025. (That\u2019s especially true because Sanders cuts are based on 1990 emissions levels, while Obama\u2019s baseline is 2005, when emissions were higher . Simply put, Sanders is vowing deeper cuts from a lower starting point). Sanders\u2019 plan offers a suite of policies for getting the U.S. on that emissions pathway, and envisions \u201can economy powered by more than 80 percent clean-energy sources by 2050.\u201d Some of them would require congressional action, including\u00a0his proposal for a tax on carbon emissions; doing away with a suite of fossil-fuel-industry tax breaks (though these breaks have already withstood years of Democratic onslaughts); and making \u201cmassive investments in energy efficiency and clean, sustainable energy such as wind and solar power.\u201d But other elements would use executive powers. Sanders says he would ratchet up fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks to an average of 65 miles per gallon in 2025. Obama administration regulations will require a fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon by that year. He also wants to thwart exports of liquefied natural gas, although regulators have already blessed a number of projects in recent years, and Sanders opposes calls to relax the decades-old, de facto ban on crude oil exports. Overall, the platform signals that while the front-running Clinton has offered some aggressive steps on energy and climate, such as an expansive solar-power plan and opposition to Arctic offshore drilling, Sanders remains to her left on energy and the environment. Elsewhere, the plan mirrors legislation Sanders recently floated that would bar the federal government from offering new drilling leases offshore and on public lands. There are also vows to invest billions of dollars in modern power grids, high-speed rail, charging infrastructure for electric cars, and other low-carbon tech. Another element of the plan is designed to provide a \u201cjust transition\u201d for fossil-fuel-industry workers during the shift to renewable energy sources. Sanders is vowing legislation to provide a \u201ccomprehensive package of benefits for workers, including extended unemployment benefits, education opportunities, health care, and job training for those transitioning to a career in the clean-energy industry.\u201d While Sanders has long been active on climate change, the new plan sounds familiar notes from him even for people who don\u2019t track energy and climate policy. It\u2019s shot-through with arguments that billionaire elites and the fossil-fuel industry have a stranglehold on U.S. policymaking that prevents more aggressive action despite the huge threats from climate change. \u201cInstead of engaging on this issue in good faith and allowing democracy to play out, executives and lobbyists for coal, oil, and gas companies have blocked every attempt to make progress on climate change, and thrown unprecedented amounts of money at elected officials to buy their loyalty,\u201d it states. So the plan calls for a ban on fossil fuel lobbyists working in the White House, restates Sanders's call to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, a constitutional amendment that bars for-profit companies from making political contributions, and more. Here\u2019s how the new plan lays out the stakes involved: \u201cClimate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. The debate is over, and the scientific jury is in: Global climate change is real, it is caused mainly by emissions released from burning fossil fuels, and it poses a catastrophic threat to the long-term longevity of our planet. If we do nothing, the planet will heat up 5\u00a0to 10\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. That would cause enough sea-level rise from melting glaciers to put cities like New York and Miami underwater\u2014along with more frequent asthma attacks, higher food prices, insufficient drinking water, and more infectious diseases.\u201d","headline":"Amid Paris Frenzy, Sanders Goes Even Bigger on Climate Change ","article_name":447831.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/amid-paris-frenzy-sanders-goes-even-bigger-on-climate-change\/447831\/","date_published":"2015-12-07 05:01:00","article_length":6004,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:34.524639","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/amid-paris-frenzy-sanders-goes-even-bigger-on-climate-change\/447831\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The president-elect appeared to consider its existence while speaking to The New York Times on Tuesday. What does the president-elect think about climate change? Who even knows anymore? Speaking at the offices of The New York Times on Tuesday, Donald J. Trump appeared to vacillate on, and sometimes even disagree with, previous statements about climate change made by Donald J. Trump. He even seemed ready to grant that climate change exists. \u201cI think there is some connectivity\u201d between humans and the changing climate, he told the Times reporters and editors, according to Maggie Haberman . Does Trump think human activity is linked to climate change? \u201cI think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much.\" \"Clean air is vitally important,\" Trump says about climate change. Says he is keeping \"an open mind.\" Clean air is not quite the issue with climate change\u2014 unlike airborne lead or particulate matter , carbon dioxide only threatens human health when it escapes into the atmosphere and screws up planetary weather patterns\u2014but even the willingness to accept global warming\u2019s existence would be a revision of Trump\u2019s views. He also told Tom Friedman, the Times columnist, that he was keeping \u201can open mind\u201d about the Paris Agreement, the first international treaty to combat climate change. Tom Friedman asks if Trump will withdraw from climate change accords. Trump: \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.\" On climate change, Trump says he is also thinking about \"how much it will cost our companies\u201d & the effect on American competitiveness. Maybe he\u2019s just been reading the news. More than 70 percent of Americans , and a majority of Republicans, want the United States to remain in the Paris Agreement, according to a poll from the University of Chicago. Hundreds of U.S. companies have also asked the Trump administration to stay in the treaty . They aren\u2019t just liberal-aligned firms, either: Many of them, including Kellogg and General Mills, have given tens of thousands to Republicans in the recent past. Even the Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly is coming around to the agreement. \u201c\u2018President-elect Trump should accept the Paris treaty on climate to buy some goodwill overseas,\u201d he said on-air last week . \u201cIt doesn't really amount to much anyway, let it go.\u201d But if Trump opted to let the United States stay in the Paris Agreement, it would represent a major shift of his views from the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement,\u201d he told a crowd in North Dakota in May. He frequently repeated that promise. Later, he said the agreement \u201cgives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.\u201d ( It doesn\u2019t .) Trump\u2019s views on climate change are famously more shaky. During the first presidential debate, he claimed that he had never said climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese to depress American manufacturing. This was a tricky claim to make\u2014since he had tweeted exactly that statement in 2012. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. It became the most retweeted tweet of the night . He later said it was a joke, but he has many other on-the-record statements (and tweets) doubting the existence of climate change. The statement continues to circulate, too: Last week, the Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs assured Trump that his country really had not made up the idea of climate change . Yet four years prior to that tweet, in December 2009, Trump and his adult three children signed an open letter in The New York Times calling on President Obama and the then-Democratic-controlled Congress to \u201cstrengthen and pass United States legislation\u201d and \u201censure meaningful and effective measures\u201d worldwide to fight climate change. \u201cIf we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet,\u201d said the letter. Climate change: \u201cScientifically irrefutable\u201d or a malignant foreign hoax? We basically have no idea what Trump thinks about climate change. These new views aren\u2019t necessarily any more binding or authentic than claims he made last month, or last spring, or last decade. What\u2019s clear instead is that Trump changes his tune depending on his audience. Maybe he figured that the Times sophisticates would want to hear him cogitate deeply on climate change, while rally goers in fracking-dependent North Dakota would yearn for angry denialism. Most importantly, the actual plans of his transition team don\u2019t reflect a newfound climate moderation. Trump\u2019s team chose Myron Ebell to lead the Environmental Protection Agency transition . Ebell, who has professionally rejected the existence of climate change since the mid-1990s, is one of the architects of Republican climate-change denial. It was Ebell who helped push the EPA not to regulate climate change during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency . Last year, he called Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical on climate change \u201cscientifically ill informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse.\u201d Ebell is, needless to say, quite an appointment to make during the hottest year ever recorded . If Trump keeps him on the team, there should be little question about the direction of his environmental policy\u2014even if the president comes around to admitting that climate change exists . Still, consider how a certain type of old-school Republican might be feeling about the incoming administration. It seems eminently plausible that in his first year in office, President Trump could permanently commit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change\u2014and also fatally destabilize NATO. The planet really is changing.","headline":"Donald Trump Doesn't Know What He Thinks About Climate Change","article_name":508541.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/what-does-trump-think-about-climate-change-he-doesnt-know-either\/508541\/","date_published":"2016-11-22 20:52:07","article_length":5780,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:35.712004","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/what-does-trump-think-about-climate-change-he-doesnt-know-either\/508541\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A risk perception expert explains why it's hard to get worked up about climate change. >A majority of people in most places agree that the earth\u2019s climate really is changing in dramatic ways, that human activity is at least part of the cause, and that we ought to act now to address the problem. But when you ask people about their personal willingness to do something about it\u2014like pay more for gasoline or electricity, or moderate our consumptive lifestyles\u2014that majority turns into a minority. Why? The facts are the facts, right? Well, not really. How risky we think something is depends on how those facts feel . People don\u2019t tend to worry as much about risks that can\u2019t happen to them. Which helps explain the perception gap on climate change. Consider a survey by Yale climate change research scientist Anthony Leiserowitz . The survey asked Americans, \u201cWho will be most harmed by climate change?\u201d Respondents said that climate change would mostly affect: Those categories in italics (my emphasis) identify how few people worry that climate change will affect them \u2014about one person in ten. Nearly five times as many people in the United States are more worried that climate change will affect polar bears and plants than are worried about themselves. Small wonder, then, that the study found more support for generic ways of dealing with climate change, like funding renewable energy research, and less support for ideas that suggest concrete personal costs, like increasing the gasoline tax by 25 cents. This isn\u2019t just in the United States. A Pew Global Studies survey in 2006 asked, \u201cHow much do you personally worry about global warming?\u201d Fewer than half the respondents worried \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change as a personal threat in France (46 percent), Turkey (41 percent), Germany (30 percent), Indonesia (38 percent, in a nation that includes 6,000 inhabited islands), Great Britain (26 percent), China (20 percent), and, bringing up the rear, the United States (19 percent). In this survey, roughly half of Americans and one-third of Chinese said that they had no personal worry about climate change at all . Then there\u2019s the gap between the believers and the non-believers. Some look at the facts and see potential disaster, while others see the same evidence and call climate change a hoax. Where does that gap come from? This is where the \u201ccultural cognition of risk\u201d comes into play. The position you take on an issue like climate change will in part be a reflection of your basic attitudes about the ideal society. Do you prefer a hierarchical society, with firm lines of authority and fixed economic and social classes? An egalitarian society, free of imposed economic and social limitations? An individualist society, with little government involvement? Or a communitarian system, with significant government and societal intervention to solve problems? Hierarchists are often climate change deniers, because solutions to the problem threaten the economic status quo with which they\u2019re most comfortable. Individualists, who, as a rule, resist the kind of social and government intervention that solutions to climate change will require, also tend to deny the problem. \u00a0Egalitarians and communitarians, on the other hand, generally believe strongly in the threat of climate change, since the solutions challenge entrenched economic structures, and require more government\/social intervention\u2014the kinds of societies egalitarians and communitarians favor. The flap over our recent strange weather is a great example of how this plays out. Hierarchists and individualists (politically conservative and libertarian) have argued that the recent snowfall in Washington D.C. disproves global warming, while egalitarians and communitarians (politically liberal and progressive) have pointed to the same unusually heavy snow as proof that the global climate is changing . \u00a0It\u2019s not about the facts; they are are just weapons in a deeper tribal war. As that culture war unfolds, the underlying psychology of risk perception provides additional weapons to both sides. In general, any risks to children, for example, evoke more fear than the same risks if they only threaten adults. So in order to raise concern, those worried about global warming emphasize that our children will suffer most if we fail to act. And since human-made risks are generally perceived as scarier than natural hazards, they also emphasize that climate change is human-made. Climate change deniers, on the other hand, make sure to suggest that if the climate is changing, the causes may in fact be natural, which makes the risk feel less scary. And they use recent events like leaked emails from climate change scientists , or a mistake over the rate of melting glaciers in the Himalayas , to undermine trust in all climate change science, since trust plays a big role in risk perception too. Again, it\u2019s not about the facts. \u00a0Each side is intuitively playing up or down the subconscious psychological factors that make the facts feel more or less frightening. DOES THIS matter? Arguments over whether climate change is real, and the lack of a sense of personal danger even among the majority that agrees that it is, produce a public ambivalent about the danger. As a result, the social will to act remains weak, which means that the political risk for government leaders to take comprehensive action remains high. Meeting the challenge of climate change, then, will require an understanding not just of the physical climate of the earth, but also of the psychological climate of our perceptions.","headline":"Global Warming: No Big Deal?","article_name":36835.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/03\/global-warming-no-big-deal\/36835\/","date_published":"2010-03-01 22:37:27","article_length":5588,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:35.903399","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/03\/global-warming-no-big-deal\/36835\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The company will begin estimating local carbon pollution from cities around the world. In the next decade or so, more than 6,000 cities, states, and provinces around the world will try to do something that has eluded humanity for 25 years: reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, which warm the atmosphere and cause climate change. The city-level leaders overseeing this task won\u2019t have the same tools available to their national peers. Most of them won\u2019t have an Environmental Protection Agency (or its equivalent), a meteorological bureau, a team of military engineers, or NASA . So where will they start? Never mind how to reduce their city\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions; how will they know what\u2019s spewing carbon dioxide in the first place? Maybe Google will do it for them. Or, at least, do it with them. Google has started estimating greenhouse-gas emissions for individual cities , part of what it recently described as an ambitious new plan to deploy its hoard of geographic information on the side of climate-concerned local leaders. \u201cThe first step toward taking climate action is creating an emissions inventory,\u201d says Saleem Van Groenou, a program manager at Google Earth. \u201cUnderstanding your current situation at the city scale, and understanding what you can do to it\u2014that\u2019s an information problem, and that\u2019s a good place for Google to sit.\u201d So far, the company has only released estimates for five cities, including Pittsburgh, Buenos Aires, and Mountain View, California. It plans to expand the program gradually to cover municipalities worldwide, but has declined to provide more specific plans. \u201cWhat we envision is an open search bar for users to search for their own city in the future,\u201d Van Groenou told me. As part of this initiative, Google says it will also release its proprietary estimates of a city\u2019s annual driving, biking, and transit ridership, generated from information collected by its popular mapping apps, Google Maps and Waze. The company has never released this kind of aggregate transportation data to the public before, and it says it may share even more specific types of data with individual local governments. \u201cThis information has historically been really hard to get a hold of,\u201d Van Groenou said. \u201cBut this is precise data, like looking at the \u2018red-yellow-green\u2019 traffic in Google Maps and aggregating it up for an entire year.\u201d Google made the announcement earlier this month as part of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. The summit, organized in part by California Governor Jerry Brown, was meant to encourage states and cities that have advanced climate policy since President Donald Trump took office. These local programs do much, but they have not replaced climate policies revoked by Trump: A recent report from Yale and a number of European think tanks found that these \u201csubnational\u201d programs could make up about half of the United States\u2019 pledged carbon cuts under the Paris Agreement. Google has framed the new project, called the Environmental Insights Explorer , as a way for leaders to focus and improve local climate programs. The victims of climate change are already here. The explorer remains a better tool for getting a glancing sense of a city\u2019s carbon emissions than it is for making meticulous policy. Right now, it can only estimate carbon emissions from electricity and transportation\u2014two important sources of pollution, but not the only ones. Heavy industry and agriculture, for instance, generate roughly a third of U.S. emissions . Google is also hampered by the age and quality of some data: To estimate how much carbon is emitted to power a given city, it must use a six-year-old data set from the EPA . But it can still provide useful information. In Pittsburgh, for instance, it estimates that the power grid drives more than three times the emissions as the transportation sector. The situation is reversed in Buenos Aires, where cars and trucks produce twice the pollution created by the electricity grid . \u201cThis is not sufficient information to decide whether to build another tunnel underneath the Hudson. We don\u2019t know that yet. But we can say that in Buenos Aires, you should probably focus on transportation as opposed to building emissions,\u201d Van Groenou said. The tool can further help would-be city planners imagine a more eco-friendly city. If Pittsburghers took an extra 1 million trips a year by bike instead of by car , they would prevent almost 700,000 tons of carbon dioxide from spewing into the atmosphere. The project also integrates some data from Project Sunroof , a Google program that aims to make it easier to install rooftop solar panels. Local governments may be most excited about Google\u2019s plan to release some ridership data. This will be the first time that Google has publicly estimated how many car trips occur to, from, or within a city every year. (There are about 547 million total in Pittsburgh.) Mike Gardner-Sweeney, the transportation director for the city of Boulder, Colorado\u2014one of the few cities in the country with a carbon tax \u2014said there was \u201cdefinitely a lot of interest\u201d from municipal managers in getting this type of Google data. Though Boulder uses a variety of technologically advanced methods to estimate travel time, the Google Maps and Waze data would augment both its real-time and more long-term sense of road use, he said. (Boulder is not working with Google at the moment.) The EPA prepares the gold-standard estimates of greenhouse-gas emissions for the United States. But these figures do not extend to the local level. Google is \u201cnot here to compete with the EPA in any way,\u201d Van Groenou said. In fact, the company cannot duplicate U.S.-level carbon estimates right now, because it would double-count all trips between two municipalities. But Van Groenou told me he hopes that Google can help cities better understand their own climate situation\u2014particularly since having a shared method of estimating emissions would let cities in different countries compare their climate policies. \u201cThe bottom line is that this is not something that Google can do alone,\u201d Van Groenou said. \u201cThis is a communal thing. This is something we have to come together to make any change on.\u201d","headline":"Google\u2019s New Tool to Fight Climate Change","article_name":571144.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2018\/09\/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/571144\/","date_published":"2018-09-25 11:30:00","article_length":6220,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:36.906275","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2018\/09\/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/571144\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Jeff Bezos has pledged more money to battling climate change than anyone ever has before. But where will it go? Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest man, announced yesterday that he would give $10 billion to fight climate change. He didn\u2019t say much else. It\u2019s not clear where the money will go, or how fast Bezos will spend it. He didn\u2019t lay out a theory of change. In a 127-word Instagram post that doubled as a press release, he said only that a new entity, the Bezos Earth Fund, would support \u201cscientists, activists, [and] NGOs\u2014any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.\u201d This gift is undeniably important. It could, by some estimates , virtually double the amount spent on climate change by American philanthropists today. And it will likely reveal something counterintuitive about the state of global climate action. Even if you believe, as Bezos does, that climate change is \u201cthe greatest threat facing our planet,\u201d spending $10 billion to fight it is still pretty difficult. Why? The first issue is organizational. \u201cDropping a big, fat check into the water is not necessarily going to make the sharks all swim in the same direction. It\u2019s going to be either a feeding frenzy or a total mess until things get sorted out, and unfortunately we don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d Daniel Firger , the managing director of Great Circle Capital Advisors, a climate-finance consulting firm, told me. (Until last year, Firger worked for the climate philanthropy of Michael Bloomberg, the Democratic presidential candidate and former New York City mayor.) Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis But the deeper challenge has to do with scale and imagination. There are only so many nonprofits and experts working on climate change. If a successful group has an annual budget of $10 million, then giving it $50 million will not necessarily make it five times as effective. Many helpful projects are probably too small for Bezos. \u201cAcross the entire landscape, there are not enough people and projects that can take the kind of capital we need,\u201d Firger said. Bezos has pledged a titanic amount of money. If he spends it evenly across 10 years, he would immediately be the country\u2019s biggest climate philanthropist. The Hewlett Foundation, which holds that title today, spends $120 million per year on climate projects. At roughly $1 billion a year, Bezos would more than octuple that amount. It is a testament to Bezos\u2019s wealth that he could single-handedly devote $400 million a year to new-energy R&D , exceeding what the federal government spends on ARPA-E, the Department of Energy\u2019s advanced-research incubator \u2014and still have $600 million a year left over for everything else. At the same time, $10 billion is not nearly enough to save the world. Consider the Gateway Tunnel, one of America\u2019s largest pending public-works projects. When completed, the 11-mile tunnel will double the number of trains that can pass between New York and New Jersey at rush hour. If the United States hopes to flush carbon pollution out of its economy, it will have to complete many projects at the Gateway Tunnel\u2019s size and scale. But the tunnel is projected to cost about $9.5 billion , or roughly $860 million per mile. Bezos\u2019s magnanimous gift of $10 billion can buy one Gateway Tunnel. Of course, this is a slightly facetious comparison\u2014it\u2019s not like Bezos was planning to invest in tristate-area infrastructure. But any similar build-out would present challenges. Jenny Chase, a solar-energy analyst for BloombergNEF, told me in an email that $10 billion would not do much good supporting large-scale solar projects: There is already a surfeit of capital chasing them. Read: Investment bankers are now waging the war on coal Where could $10 billion go the furthest? It just may be politics. In 2016, the network of conservative groups run by the industrialists Charles and David Koch promised to spend about $900 million on the presidential election. Two years later, it pledged about $400 million to the 2018 congressional midterms. Both of those amounts, widely covered as unprecedented interventions in the political system, represented not only the personal donations of the Kochs but the pooled contributions of hundreds of like-minded donors. But with his $10 billion, Bezos could single-handedly spend comparable amounts on every presidential and midterm election from now to 2050\u2014supporting climate-friendly members of Congress, governors, and presidents. Once in office, those politicians could then shake loose far more than $10 billion for tunnels, new rail projects, and everything else. And unlike other donors, Bezos\u2014 an accomplished blogger \u2014is free to  spend generously in politics. Because he pledged the $10 billion as a personal commitment, and not as an outlay from a preexisting foundation, Bezos is legally allowed to give it to political causes, as well as to candidates, parties, and super PACs. Wealthy foundations with dead benefactors cannot participate in the political system to the same degree. Of course, politics isn\u2019t the only place he could spend. He could also endow prizes for people who build certain climate-friendly moonshot technologies, such as electric planes or cheaper batteries. Jenny Chase, the solar analyst, suggested in her email that Bezos build out zero-carbon power infrastructure in countries that would otherwise turn to fossil fuels: Perhaps he could add solar panels to every school roof in Indonesia, she mused. The climate scientist and policy guru Joseph Majkut dreamed on Twitter that Bezos could decarbonize a single U.S. state to demonstrate that it can be done: \u201cPour [money] into the state university, vocational schooling, community grants. Grease every wheel. All the human capital you buil[d] will diffuse to other jurisdictions,\u201d he said. Bezos isn\u2019t the only newcomer to the climate fight. In the past six months, investment banks and private-equity firms have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to climate solutions. (Goldman Sachs committed $750 billion late last year.) What those bankers\u00a0 are discovering is that there are not enough projects to sop up the deluge. \u201cI think it\u2019s as much a failure of imagination as much as it\u2019s a failure of the market,\u201d Firger said. The success of those investments may turn on the same question as Bezos\u2019s gift: Will climate solutions, long a tiny sector of the economy, scale up quickly enough to (1) guzzle the new flood of cash and (2) prevent the unthinkable? It\u2019s going to be one of the most fascinating stories of the coming year\u2014and one of the most important of the coming century.","headline":"$10 Billion?

{"id":null,"body":"A musician translated the changing ecology of a forest into song. The Alexander Archipelago, a 300-mile-long sweep of islands off the southeastern coast of Alaska, is known for its isolation, its heavy rain, and its thick, ancient forests of hemlock, pine, spruce, and yellow-cedar . Yellow-cedar, which John Muir called a \u201ctruly noble tree,\u201d has long been prized for its fine-grained, butter-colored wood. But over the past century, as average temperatures have risen, shrinking spring-snow cover has exposed more and more of the species\u2019s shallow roots to freezing temperatures, and yellow-cedars have been dying off . Because the tree was and is used for so many human purposes\u2014canoe paddles, ceremonial carvings, even bridges\u2014the disruption is both ecological and cultural. Ecologist Lauren Oakes wanted to know how the rest of the forest was responding to this long upheaval, so in the summers of 2011 and 2012, she and her field crew sampled forest stands in the archipelago, comparing tree size and species composition at different stages of yellow-cedar decline. In the south, where the decline is most advanced, she found that while some very old yellow-cedars are hanging on, there are few young trees\u2014and those are usually outcompeted by other species such as western hemlock and Sitka spruce. Oakes had glimpsed the future of the forest, and she wanted to communicate what she\u2019d seen\u2014especially to the people whose lives are still shaped by yellow-cedar. So after she summarized her results in the language of science\u2014bar graphs, charts, and scatter plots\u2014she decided to use the language of music, too. Oakes shared her data with Nik Sawe , a fellow Stanford Ph.D. student and amateur musician who is experimenting with \u201c data sonification ,\u201d or the translation of information into sound. Simple sonifications are often used for emergencies (four-alarm fires) and in assistive technologies (audible crosswalk signs), but in recent years, scientists and musicians have begun to sonify much more complicated datasets. Musician Brian Foo has sonified data on income inequality in New York City, land loss in Louisiana, and air quality in Beijing. This year, scientists at LIGO translated the minute spacetime vibrations created by gravitational waves into audible burps and chirps. Since our ears are especially sensitive to patterns, sonifications can help scientists more fully communicate their results to the public\u2014and even recognize hidden patterns in their own data. \u201cResearchers are always talking about multidimensional space, but that means nothing to the public, and it\u2019s even hard to understand as a scientist,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so cool about sound is that you can hear all the variables at the same time.\u201d To represent the changing forests of the Alexander Archipelago in music, Sawe used a different instrument or group of instruments for each of the five conifer species Oakes measured\u2014piano for yellow-cedar, flute for western hemlock, cello and bass for Sitka spruce, violin and viola for mountain hemlock, and clarinet for shore pine. In the clip above, each note represents a tree, and its pitch and how hard it\u2019s hit corresponds with tree\u2019s height and diameter. (Lower, shorter notes stand for younger trees, while higher, longer notes stand for older ones.) Dead trees are represented by dropped notes\u2014gaps of silence that widen as the sonification moves from the cooler study plots in the north to the warmer plots in the south. The spreading silence in this \u201cspecies solo\u201d by yellow-cedar is, in effect, the sound of climate change: While these sonifications are faithful to Oakes\u2019 data, Sawe did have some artistic license. He chose, for instance, to set them in a minor key, and to represent the ascendant western hemlock with a relatively quiet flute. Put the pieces in a major key, switch the flute for a trumpet, and an elegy might become a story of adaptation and recovery. Oakes, who also conducted extensive interviews with people affected by the decline of yellow-cedar, has noticed a similar variation in human reactions. \u201cYou can focus on the silences or the sadness, or you can focus on what\u2019s coming in,\u201d she observes. The data doesn\u2019t change, but our responses to its patterns can be set in any key\u2014even all of them at once.

{"id":null,"body":"Get ready for a big downgrade. We all know that climate change threatens to devastate coastal cities, disrupt food production, and trigger a refugee crisis of untold proportions. It\u2019s also bad for a nation\u2019s credit rating, according to a report released Thursday by Standard & Poor\u2019s . That would be seem to be the least of the worries of, say, Vietnam, which S&P ranked dead last of 116 countries\u2019 vulnerability to climate change-related credit risk. (Investors, on the other hand, might want to bet on Luxembourg, which was deemed least vulnerable to climate catastrophe.) Yet those countries most at risk from global warming\u00ad\u2014primarily those in low-lying Southeast Asia and Africa\u2014are precisely those that will need to tap global credit markets to both prepare for ever-stronger hurricanes and super-typhoons like the one that struck the Philippines last November, as well as deal with the aftermath. And if the world\u2019s governments ever get their act together on a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\u2014don\u2019t hold your breath\u2014those countries will need investment to switch to carbon-free renewable sources of energy. \u201cExtreme weather events, especially floods, can be expected to increasingly take a toll on a country's infrastructure and thus productivity, exacerbating weakening endowment of productive infrastructure observable in a number of countries,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s authors. \u201cNational budgets would invariably come under additional strains, potentially putting downward pressure on sovereign ratings as debts and deficits mount.\u201d S&P has yet to change any country\u2019s credit rating based on its vulnerability to climate change, noting that the complexity of the phenomenon makes it difficult to assess the specific impact on any one nation. Yet clearly the rating agency is thinking about it. In the report, S&P scored a nation\u2019s vulnerability to climate change-related credit risk according to what percentage of its population lives in coastal areas that are 16 feet or less above sea level; agriculture\u2019s share of gross domestic product, given food production is highly dependent on climate; and its ranking on the Notre Dame University Global Adaptation Index , which measures a country\u2019s ability to adapt to climate change. No surprise that the most vulnerable countries are poor, agricultural-intensive nations located in regions of the world already prone to typhoons and flooding. Nearly half of Vietnam\u2019s population, for instance, lives in low-lying coastal areas. And agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of its GDP. The story is similar for the other most countries deemed by S&P to be most vulnerable\u2014such as Bangladesh, Senegal, Mozambique, Fiji, and the Philippines Countries most resilient to climate change-related credit risk are landlocked nations\u00a0with few farmers such as Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland. The United States ranked No. 10, and nine of the 10 least vulnerable countries are in Europe. But don\u2019t take too much comfort in that. As S&P notes, climate change is a global catastrophe and there really is nowhere to hide. \u201cWe expect the significance of this mega-trend in assessing sovereign risk to only increase over coming decades, as evidence of the economic implications of climate change and extreme weather events becomes ever more visible,\u201d the report states.","headline":"How Climate Change Will Destroy Your Country's Credit Rating ","article_name":371065.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/05\/how-climate-change-will-devastate-your-countrys-credit-rating\/371065\/","date_published":"2014-05-16 17:33:39","article_length":3317,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:38.380206","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2014\/05\/how-climate-change-will-devastate-your-countrys-credit-rating\/371065\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It may be impossible to reach the U.N.'s goals without significant changes in global diet, a new study finds. If we really want to cut down on global greenhouse emissions, we're going to have to do something about cow farts*. That's the conclusion of a study published today in the journal Climatic Change.\u00a0 If we have any shot of reaching the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's global-warming mitigation goals, the world is going to have to start eating a lot less meat. Thirty-seven percent of all human-caused methane emissions\u00a0 come from the worldwide agricultural industry . Compared with CO2, methane is 21 times more effective at trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere,\u00a0 according to \u00a0the United Nations. While transportation and electricity account for more than half of emissions in the United States, the EPA\u00a0 reports \u00a0that agriculture comprises 8 percent of all greenhouse-gas emissions.\u00a0And while relatively small, that's a significant contribution that can't be ignored \u2014 especially considering how progress in halting emissions from transportation has so far been minimal. \"In order to have any chance to reach a 2 degree target, fossil-fuel use has to be reduced drastically,\" Fredrik Hedenus, the study's lead author, wrote in an email. \"However, what we show is that may not be sufficient, as the agricultural emissions ... may be too high. Thus we have to take action in both sectors.\" Transportation and energy are the biggest sources of greenhouse gases, but researchers say a global shift in people's diets is also necessary to contain climate change.\"We therefore conclude that dietary changes are crucial for meeting the 2 degree C target with high probability.\" So, how much less meat do we have to eat? \"It all depends how much we can and want to do in the energy sector,\" Hedenus explains. \"If we do a lot there it may be sufficient with a 25 percent lower meat and dairy consumption than predicted in 2070. If we do less, somewhere around 75 percent less may be reasonable.\" If 25 percent to 75 percent less meat consumption worldwide sounds like an absurd long shot, it is. Global meat demand only continues to rise, as fueled by China and the developing world. Meat consumption in the United States has actually declined in recent years, explains Emily Adams, a researcher with the Earth Policy Institute. \"Meat consumption peaked in the United States as a nation in 2007 and since then it has fallen 4 percent,\" Adams says. \"That's not a 75 percent reduction like they are talking about, but that's coming without government fiat or absolutely insane food prices.\" But while meat consumption in the United States has fallen, that's a small drop compared with the rising demand in China. (Earth Policy Institute) Also Monday, the IPCC released its latest progress report on climate change, finding \u00a0that\u00a0\"global climate-change risks are high to very high with global mean temperature increase of 4 degrees C or more above preindustrial levels ... and include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, and the combination of high temperature and humidity compromising normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year.\" The reports are getting scarier, and papers like Hedenus's underscore how, if we're really going to attenuate the rate of climatic change, we're going to need severe changes in our culture. Electric cars may come to replace conventional ones, but they'll still be cars. Getting people to change their diets will require a global change in thinking and behavior. The study's authors aren't exactly optimistic about this hard fact. \"Substantial deviations from current dietary preferences are unlikely and would probably occur only as a result of policy interventions,\" they write. \"However, policy-driven dietary changes are contentious and would almost certainly emerge only after productivity improvement and technical measures largely have been exhausted.\" *Clarification: Cow burps and manure actually contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than the flatulence does.","headline":"It May Take a Global Vegetarian Movement to Combat Climate Change","article_name":453762.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/03\/it-may-take-a-global-vegetarian-movement-to-combat-climate-change\/453762\/","date_published":"2014-03-31 11:00:41","article_length":4190,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:39.148577","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/03\/it-may-take-a-global-vegetarian-movement-to-combat-climate-change\/453762\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The denial of climate change and the denial of racism rest on the same foundation: an attack on observable reality. For two years, they formed a community of experts, about 1,000 in all, including 300 leading climate scientists inside and outside 13 federal agencies. For two years, they volunteered their time and expertise to produce the Fourth National Climate Assessment. There is no parallel process to tackle the questions I study; there is no ongoing national racial assessment mandated by a law summarizing the impact of racism on the United States, now and in the future. Still, I can relate to these climate scientists. From U.S. national assessments to the global assessments of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate scientists have been pumping out warnings for decades. Each warning about what will happen if there is not \u201csubstantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse-gas emissions\u201d has been more dreadful than the last. I can relate to their continuous stand on scientific certainty, their continuous travel toward scientific discovery, and their quest to cultivate and defend humanity from humanity. \u201cI\u2019m for humans,\u201d the climate scientist Andrea Dutton recently tweeted . The first volume of their Fourth National Climate Assessment, released last year, concluded that there is \u201cno convincing alternative explanation\u201d for global warming other than \u201chuman activities, especially emissions of greenhouses gases.\u201d This year\u2019s second volume, released into the mad dash of Black Friday sales and family reunions, stated , \u201cMore frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities.\u201d Read: The 11-year-old suing Trump over climate change \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d President Donald Trump said in response. \u201cNo. No. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d I have heard this before. I can relate. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019m not racist,\u201d Trump has said repeatedly . Evidence be damned. I feel how climate scientists probably feel when they hear Trump and others disbelieve what their scientific community says is beyond disbelief. Scholars of racism watch as individuals dismiss our scientific consensus as casually as they form a consensus of disbelief. Climate and racial scientists watch as the denials of climate change and racism combine for the denial that \u201cmarginalized\u201d communities of color \u201care expected to experience greater impacts,\u201d as foretold in the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The disbelievers do not believe that either climate change or racism is real. Or they do not believe they are caused by emissions of greenhouse gases or racist policies. Or they do not believe that regulating them would be better for society. All this disbelief rests on the same foundation: the transformation of science into belief. It is a foundation built from the economic, political, and ideological blocks that stand the most to lose from the aggressive reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions and racial inequities. These defensive voices engage in the same oratorical process, attack the credibility of scientists, disregarding their consensus and reducing their findings to personal beliefs. The effect: Science becomes belief. Belief becomes science. Everything becomes nothing. Nothing becomes everything. All can believe and disbelieve all. We all can know everything and know nothing. Everyone lives as an expert on every subject. No experts live on any subject. Years of intense and specialized training and research and reflection are abandoned, like poor Latino immigrants, like the poor body of our planet. Instead of trained racial researchers, individuals decide whether they are racist, whether their ideas are racist, whether their policies are racist, whether their institutions are racist. Instead of trained climate researchers, individuals decide whether that worst-ever natural disaster, whether that record temperature, whether that rising sea level is caused by climate change. The great confrontations of our time are not between scientists, but between individual beliefs and scientific knowledge. Adam Serwer: America\u2019s problem isn\u2019t tribalism\u2014it\u2019s racism How many Americans, as they strive to be balanced and objective and bipartisan, to bring people together, think they can subscribe to both individual disbelief and scientific knowledge? How many Americans believe there are very fine ideas on both sides of these questions? How many Americans ask, \u201cDo you think racism is still a problem?\u201d or \u201cDo you believe the globe is warming?\u201d as if society should value ignorance in the face of scientific certainty. I am relatively ignorant about climate science, and about every subject matter outside my own expertise of racism and anti-racism. The ridiculousness of climate-change denial is matched by the ridiculous of asking people like me whether we believe in climate change. The ridiculousness of denials of racism is matched by the ridiculousness of asking whether people believe in the persistence of racism. And in their ridiculous answers to ridiculous questions, denialists evince more than disbelief. They explain their disbelief using examples in their direct line of sight. They do not trust the far-flung hindsight, foresight, and bird\u2019s-eye view of the scientist. They do not believe the distant averages, likelihoods, disparities, and sweeping histories that show the ravages of racism and climate change on society. If it is not happening within their narrow field of vision, then it is not happening. They disbelieve. They call \u201cbelieving\u201d scientific findings stupid. They call their disbelief high intelligence. \u201cA lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we\u2019re not necessarily such believers,\u201d Trump said of climate change. \u201cYou look at our air and our water, and it\u2019s right now at a record clean.\u201d In disbelieving the present observable realities, they certainly disbelieve future projections. If they disregard the fact that white-nationalist violence has worsened and U.S. law enforcement does not know how to stop it, will they believe that it will get even worse? If they ignore the enormous racial disparities in wealth, will they accept the projection of the Institute for Policy Studies that the median wealth of black households will redline at $0 by 2053 and that Latino wealth will redline two decades later? If they cannot see the changing climate today, will they buy the assessment of the Fourth National Climate Assessment that \u201cwith continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century\u2014more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states\u201d? Instead of science, they hunt for signs. Read: Climate change is already damaging American democracy \u201cBrutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS\u2014Whatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d Trump tweeted weeks ago. \u201cUS dominates Olympics,\u201d tweeted Bill O\u2019Reilly after the 2016 Rio Olympics. \u201cHow can this be if we are a terrible country that persecutes minorities? Press is deceiving world about the US.\u201d \u201cWho could not be moved at the sight of a major political party naming Barack Obama, an African American, as its presidential candidate?\u201d Dinesh D\u2019Souza asked weeks before Obama\u2019s election. \u201cTo me, there could not be a better sign that America has left behind its racist past.\u201d Signs reign in the realm of belief. Belief reigns in the realm of what we cannot or do not know. Let me say it differently. I know because of science. When I do not know, I believe or disbelieve. As such, the end game of the transformation of science to belief is the execution of knowing. And the end of knowing is the end of human advancement. Do not get me wrong. We should not follow all scientific pronouncements blindly. I am not saying every scientist and scientific consensus is indisputable. For decades before the publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species in 1859, the scientific consensus of polygenesis found that the races were separate species with separate origins. At the turn of the 20th century, the scientific consensus of social Darwinism found the white race had been naturally selected for the highest evolution. After World War II, the scientific consensus of black cultural pathology urged African Americans to assimilate into white America. But scientific anti-racists on the margins did not respond to mainstream scientific racists by saying they didn\u2019t believe their findings, by spinning out easily disprovable alternative facts, by walking away. It is one thing to disbelieve scientific findings. It is yet another thing to dispute scientific findings. We dispute on the basis of training and expertise; by conducting and finding and presenting evidence; and by challenging assumptions, flawed study designs, and analyses of findings. Unlike disbelieving, disputing produces an intellectual exchange among open-minded scientists. Only the disbelievers, some of whom pose as scientists, are closed-minded and unwilling to change their mind in response to new evidence. In order to reinforce the scientific certainty that human action and inaction are disastrously warming the globe and racist action and inaction are disastrously causing racial inequities, environmentalists and anti-racists must separate belief from science. Instead of caring about belief, environmentalists and anti-racists should care about knowledge, especially our own. Instead of asking, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d we should be asking, \u201cWhat is a racist?\u201d Instead of asking, \u201cDo you believe in climate change?\u201d we should be asking, \u201cWhat does climate change look like?\u201d To disconnect science from belief, environmentalists and anti-racists must disconnect the disbelievers from the power to make racial and climate policy. When disbelievers take power, they will always believe in the business of reproducing disbelief. Environmentalists and anti-racists must be in the business of reproducing humanity.","headline":"What the Believers Are Denying","article_name":579190.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/01\/what-deniers-climate-change-and-racism-share\/579190\/","date_published":"2019-01-01 11:00:00","article_length":10179,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:39.567918","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/01\/what-deniers-climate-change-and-racism-share\/579190\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Planetary warming is no longer the sole province of \u201cclimate fiction.\u201d It\u2019s creeping into all kinds of writing. Our stories about environmental catastrophe used to be set in distant futures: the desolate endlessness of The Road , or the hopeless, cutthroat scrounging in the Parable of the Sower . But that kind of far-off storytelling feels like it was made for a time when the repercussions of changing climate and the inequity of natural-resource use were, in fact, far off. Must have been nice. Ecological disaster and long-term fallout are no longer rare or surprising, and they\u2019re not limited to specific parts of the planet. One-third of Americans said they were affected by extreme weather events in the past two years, and 2022 has already brought fire and floods. Those are climate change\u2019s most obvious consequences, but its daily effects are subtle, creeping into our everyday lives. They\u2019re showing up as rising food prices and rampant spring windstorms . Our changing planet is stressing our relationships and limiting our choices in the short and long term. And that\u2019s showing up in fiction. An increasing number of writers are weaving climate change into their domestic dramas or their comedies of errors as an unavoidable part of life today or in the very near future. Environmental degradation isn\u2019t the main thrust of these novels, like it may have been in classic climate fiction. In some ways, this shift represents our growing distaste for preachy stories about inevitable climatic doom. It\u2019s also just an example of fiction reflecting our reality. But this new breed of environmental novel can make the stakes of future choices, and their effects on ordinary individuals and scenarios, seem clear: When survival is on the line, books can drill into the core human question of how we take care of one another and ourselves. The books below aren\u2019t about climate change\u2014they\u2019re about immigration, corporate malfeasance, and tourism; they focus on families, neighbors, and friends. But in each, the anxieties of our warming age force their way in, simmering quietly in the background or erupting across the page. Vigil Harbor , by Julia Glass Ten-ish years from now, in a stifling New England town fixated on its own past, an ecoterrorist attack forces members of the community\u2014including recent divorc\u00e9es and immigrants whose status is threatened\u2014to confront how unstable their lives are. Glass has called Vigil Harbor , which follows a wide cast through the lead-up to and aftereffects of the incident, \u201ca near future in which the volume has been turned up.\u201d Using the attack as a prism, she shows how small-scale domestic issues, such as unhappy boomerang kids and the fate of immigrant-run landscaping companies, could be even more pressurized in that loud future. Trees fail to grow, tides overtake nearby neighborhoods, and Glass lets the hum of a collapsing ecosystem underline each strand of the plot, to show how it can make stressful situations worse, and how the threat of a rocky future can make insular people desperate and selfish. Prodigal Summer , by Barbara Kingsolver Flight Behavior , Kingsolver\u2019s book explicitly about the collapse of butterfly migration, might seem like a more obvious choice for a climate novel, but Prodigal Summer came first. It\u2019s more subtle, telling three interwoven stories about a rural Appalachian town where disorder is seeping into nature: Poachers are moving in on coyote pups, neighbors are battling over pesticides, and a young widow is trying to hold on to her in-laws\u2019 family farm. Kingsolver, who was a biologist before she was a novelist, has a knack for highlighting how humans become deeply rooted to place. In outlining those small, itchy issues that can divide communities or pull them close, she puts the signal before the noise, and points out the way people who pay attention to the natural world notice it changing before they know what to do about it. The Water Knife , by Paolo Bacigalupi The Water Knife follows Angel Velasquez, a petty thug turned political assassin, as he tries to track down a valuable water source in the Southwest. It might feel a bit too much like traditional, far-future cli-fi if it weren\u2019t for the current, rapidly aridifying conditions across the world and the ways western states are locked in political and logistical battles over water as the country\u2019s biggest reservoirs shrink . It\u2019s a feat to make natural-resource laws interesting, much less thrilling, but Bacigalupi cleverly lets wonky water policy, and particularly 1922\u2019s Colorado River Compact, become the main drama of the story. When water is a rare commodity, it quickly delineates who lives and who dies. The tension is about money and power, too: As Velasquez goes deeper into a violent battle over water rights, and the compact, the one thing keeping everyone civil, falls apart, the novel shows how the laws and practices we consider fixed don\u2019t hold up in a world that\u2019s getting hotter and drier. Read: Climate fiction: Can books save the planet? Salvage the Bones , by Jesmyn Ward It\u2019s hard to show climate disaster on a personal scale, because those kinds of catastrophes tend to happen either very fast or very slowly. In Salvage the Bones , Ward drills into one family\u2019s story to outline the broad, unequal consequences of long-term environmental injustice, and the short-term trauma of destructive winds and water. Her tight narrative follows the Batiste family through the 12 days before and after Hurricane Katrina. Ward lived through the storm herself, and her visceral details of disaster, like the sound of rain on the roof and the way animals go silent before a storm, outline both the fear and the fierceness the Batistes feel as they try to protect their homes and themselves. As they prepare for landfall and then ride it out, Ward demonstrates that human drama doesn\u2019t stop for weather\u2014the main character, teenage Esch, is hiding a new pregnancy\u2014but it bends to it. How Beautiful We Were , by Imbolo Mbue You can probably guess how well things turn out when Pexton, a foreign-oil company, comes to the fictional West African village of Kosawa and promises the residents \u201ccivilization\u201d and \u201cprosperity\u201d for use of the oil under their land. By the beginning of How Beautiful We Were , the local river is already poisoned and children are dying. But that\u2019s just the start: Mbue takes a too-familiar story about the degradation of energy extraction, corrupt government, and vulnerable communities and stretches it out over four decades, watching the characters change as the crisis drags on. Instead of a simple David and Goliath fight, the novel illustrates how different people respond to the circumstances they grew up in, who stays and who goes, and the tension between protecting yourself and fighting for what\u2019s right. Fall Back Down When I Die , by Joe Wilkins In eastern Montana, at the start of the first legal wolf hunt in more than three decades, the ranch hand Wendell Newman gets sucked into a manhunt when an anti-government fringe group takes over the event. Climate issues are appearing in divisive fights about the ways we use over-tapped public land and manage fragile populations of wild animals. Charismatic fauna, like wolves, often inflame those battles because they\u2019re seen as both livestock-killing villains and vital parts of the ecosystem. That conflict turns violent in the book, in a way that echoes other recent standoffs over public acres, and Wilkins subtly uses that battle to point out how climate intertwines with identity politics. Wendell, who has complicated sympathies for both the rebels and the regulators, has to face up to his family\u2019s history of abuse as he picks a side. Read: A novel that imagines a world without bees 10:04 , by Ben Lerner How do you create a future you want? How much power might you have over what\u2019s to come, anyway? Those are questions at the core of 10 :04 , Lerner\u2019s autofictional novel, which takes place in New York, bracketed by Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy. The narrator is an author struggling to figure out his second book. He\u2019s wrestling with a potentially fatal medical diagnosis; deciding whether to be a sperm donor for his best friend; and wondering whether any of that is worth thinking about as the city is inundated by storms. Lerner\u2019s writing spirals back on itself, retracing its own plotlines and perseverating on the same points. At turns sarcastic and overly earnest, his knotty storytelling style mimics the feeling of trying to make decisions when there\u2019s no clear answer and you\u2019re not sure how the coming years\u2014or the Earth\u2014will turn out. It feels a lot like living right now. How Strange a Season , by Megan Mayhew Bergman The short stories in Bergman\u2019s collection each create their own kind of weather, like the swampy South Carolina plantation of \u201cIndigo Run\u201d and the stifling chill of a human-scale New York terrarium in \u201cWorkhorse.\u201d Nearly all of the interludes touch on climate as they follow women trying to make their way through systems in which they\u2019re complicit but not completely in charge. In \u201cA Taste for Lionfish,\u201d Lily is sent to stormy coastal North Carolina to persuade the locals to start eating invasive species as part of a job for a conservation nonprofit. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell these poor folks how to fix a rich folks\u2019 problem,\u201d one of the locals tells Lily, as Bergman confronts an ugly truism of environmentalism: Some earnest outsider probably isn\u2019t going to come in and serve up the easy solution, and those most affected are usually the least to blame. Leave the World Behind , by Rumaan Alam We\u2019re not quite sure what the apocalypse is in Leave the World Behind , but we know something has happened to the world of Amanda and Clay, a couple of uptight Brooklynites on vacation with their kids. They\u2019ve been cut off from all kinds of communication, and things become even weirder when their Airbnb hosts turn up, forcing them to cope with the crisis together. Of all the creepy, unknown feelings Alam accesses, the most unsettling one is uselessness. When it becomes clear that they\u2019re in some kind of crisis, the characters, essentially, do nothing. They putter and bicker and talk behind one another\u2019s backs, seeding suspicions and distrust. Alam shows how one crisis could quickly upend life as we know it, and how fragile the social norms that hold us together might be when that happens. Read: Writing the Pulitzer-winning The Overstory changed Richard Powers\u2019s life Here Comes the Sun , by Nicole Dennis-Benn In Here Comes the Sun , Dolores and her two daughters, a hotel worker named Margot and a teenage artist named Thandi, are stuck on the edge of a resort community in drought-stricken Jamaica, trying to work their way out of the extractive tourism industry. As the white hotel magnate Margot works for threatens to displace their home with a new resort, their ability to find other options is limited. Dolores sold Margot into sex work as a teenager, and she\u2019s trapped in that work as she tries to pay for Thandi to go to school; meanwhile the oppressive drought is making other ways of earning a living, such as farming and fishing, unstable. Dennis-Benn doesn\u2019t let anyone off easy or tie the story up neatly, and she uses the unbearable conditions as a narrative metaphor for increasing pressure. She forces the reader to consider the choices people make when resources are scarce, and the only commodity they might be able to trade is themselves. The House of Broken Angels , by Luis Alberto Urrea As his body shuts down with cancer, Big Angel, the titular character of Urrea\u2019s sprawling family story, calls a final birthday party for himself, to hash out his family\u2019s regrets and try to bestow some wisdom. Nothing goes as planned. Urrea\u2019s language is rhythmic and lively, and his details make a tale of impending death, gang violence, and family trauma charming and hilarious. He switches easily between gallows humor and sparks of heartfelt humanity. Drought pulses under everything, as a fact of life in Southern California and a metaphor for fighting the elements. Big Angel often flashes back to his childhood in La Paz, Baja California Sur, contrasting the vivid landscape there, where his family fished and raised animals, with the dried-out shopping malls of San Diego. But as Big Angel tries to make amends with his sparring relatives, he shows them that you can still be happy around destruction, and joyful in the face of death. \u200b\u200bWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

{"id":null,"body":"A weekly summary of global-warming news, for people who want to pay more attention to it. I remember the first time I learned about climate change. I was sitting at a fancy restaurant with my parents, reading a science magazine under the table. (I think it was Kids Discover , which\u2014with its full-page photos, friendly writing, and cartoonish illustrations\u2014ranked up there with the Klutz books as \u201990s edutainment par excellence.) In the bottom half of a page, there was an info box: Scientists had identified something called the greenhouse effect, which could make disastrously extreme weather more common and the planet too hot to inhabit. I remember looking around the table, anxiously, before stammering out a question to my parents: Did they know about this? Humanity breaking the planet, and adults were doing nothing about it? I have lost count of the number of people who have identified climate as \u201cthe political issue of the 21 st century.\u201d It ranks up there for me. Food, water, protection from the elements: It feels insufficient to say that climate touches everything , because it in fact permeates us. Physically, materially, existentially, the climate determines what it feels like to have a human body in this biosphere. And that means that every consideration of the future\u2014of security personal, economic, and international\u2014winds back to climate. When I consider whether to have children, I think about climate change. When I consider where I want to live, I think about climate change. When I stand on the beach and play catch with my younger brothers and wonder what their young adulthood will be like, I think of refugees and resource wars\u2014and, thus, climate change. Even my current career, as a technology reporter, was inflected by the climate: When I first got into technology in the mid-2000s, I was partly drawn to it because I thought all that new wealth\u2014and all that new expertise in handling data\u2014might flow toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, a phenomenon without a mind, is engrained in every texture of my every ordinary day. And I want to follow it better. So I\u2019m starting this . Posts will live here in The Atlantic \u2019s new Science section , but they\u2019ll also go to readers\u2019s inboxes. You can subscribe here: Enter your email address powered by TinyLetter This situation we live in, this situation which realistically we will never stop living in: How did it develop in 2015? In the popular U.S. press this past summer, there have been two big, attention-getting answers. Eric Holthaus, Rolling Stone, \u201c The Point of No Return: Climate Change Nightmares Are Already Here \u201d: Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state's Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K. Jonathan Chait, New York Magazine, \u201c This Is the Year Humans Finally Got Serious About Saving Themselves From Themselves \u201d: Those who have consigned the world to its doom should reconsider. The technological and political underpinnings are at last in place to actually consummate the first global pact to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. The world is suddenly responding to the climate emergency with\u2014by the standards of its previous behavior\u2014astonishing speed. The game is not over. And the good guys are starting to win. Is 2015 the year of shit-fan-hitting or of humanity-serious-getting? The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, exactly, but they reflect different dispositions toward history. Are the recent American regulations cause for hope, or is everything getting worse much faster than we thought? There are other, more expert accounts that loom behind these, too: In July, the climate scientist James Hansen released a revised study on melting ice in Antarctica and Greenland. It estimates that sea level rise could occur 10 times as fast as previously believed. He and his coauthors warn that the resulting refugee disasters and resource shortages could produce an \u201cungovernable world.\u201d Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical, Laudato si\u2019, positioned the world\u2019s largest Christian church behind climate-change mitigation. And Al Gore has taken a more optimistic turn: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this,\u201d he told The New York Times in March . \u201cThe only question is how long it takes.\u201d Hansen\u2019s and the Pope\u2019s pleas are addressed to the UN climate talks in Paris at the end of this year, when UN member states will gather for the 20th time to consider limiting carbon emissions. Unlike in previous years, it seems likely they will take a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to the talks, agreeing to voluntary accords (not internationally binding ones) as the United States and China have done. Climate is a strange story. Even if the UN talks come to nought, there will be macro-trends that shape the safety of Earth\u2014trends like the falling cost of renewable energy, and the American abandonment of coal \u2014that will continue. Our understanding of those big trends changes week-to-week, and it seems useful (if climate change really is a big political deal) to follow those trends beyond the gloom or succor of a big magazine profile. I want to follow the climate in a way that\u2019s not (a) reading a big, scary story, (b) freaking out for a day, (c) forgetting about it and going on with my life. Here are the most important, concrete trends in climate news right now: The atmosphere is filling with greenhouse gases. The Mauna Loa Observatory measured 398.49 CO2 molecules in the atmosphere per million molecules this week. A year ago, it measured 396.12 ppm. Ten years ago, it measured 377.86 ppm. An \"unsafe\" level is anything above 350 ppm. \u201c You owe the world $12,000 for burning all those fossil fuels ,\u201d if you\u2019re an American born before 1995, but the article goes on to say you might owe something closer to $66,000. Renewable energy costs are plunging faster than anyone estimated. This week\u2019s headline: The U.S. will likely add 7.7 gigawatts of solar power this year, or enough to power a little less than 5.4 million homes. China already installed that much solar between January and June of this year. + A reminder of just how big the plunge in renewable costs has been : Experts predicted in 2000 that wind-generated power worldwide would reach 30 gigawatts; by 2010, it was 200 gigawatts, and by last year it reached nearly 370, or more than 12 times higher. Installations of solar power would add one new gigawatt per year by 2010, predictions in 2002 stated. It turned out to be 17 times that by 2010 and 48 times that amount last year. The U.S. really seems like it\u2019s going to get serious about regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The Clean Power Plan, \" the most important action any president has taken to address the climate crisis ,\" got its first Congressional hearing , which was mostly Republicans saying how much they dislike the regulation. But any attempt to stop the plan will come from the courts, where the Obama administration won a fairly meaningless victory this week . The UN\u2019s most-anticipated climate negotiations since 2009 begin in 11 weeks. Last week, the French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande connected the upcoming talks to the continent\u2019s ongoing refugee crisis : \u201cIf we don\u2019t conclude [with a successful agreement], and there are no substantial measures to ensure the transition [to a climate-affected world], it won\u2019t be hundreds of thousands of refugees in the next 20 years, it will be millions.\u201d About 100,000 people live in Kiribati. Its roughly 800 square-mile area is distributed across 33 islands in the central Pacific Ocean. The IMF and the World Bank disagree over whether it has the smallest economy in the world or only the third smallest. At a forum last week with Pacific island nations, its president pleaded with Australia and New Zealand to commit to only 1.5\u00b0 Celsius of climate change . \u201cIt\u2019s not about economic development,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not politics. It\u2019s survival.\u201d About 23.5 million people live in Australia; its 2.9 million square miles sit mostly on its eponymous continent. It has about the 20 th largest economy in the world. Last week, its immigration minister joked on a live mic about those meetings running late: \u201cTime doesn\u2019t mean anything when you\u2019re, you know, about to have water lapping at your door.\u201d Australia did not commit to the 1.5\u00b0 Celsius target. Since then, Australia has changed prime ministers. Its new chief executive says he does not anticipate altering the nation\u2019s climate-change policy . And\u2026 hello again. This is an experiment.

{"id":null,"body":"Call it the \u201cGates Rule.\u201d Every Tuesday, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . Lately, Bill Gates has been thinking about what he calls the \u201chard stuff\u201d of climate change. He isn\u2019t talking about the challenges that we usually discuss in this newsletter, such as how to generate zero-carbon electricity (use wind, solar, and some nuclear). Nor does he mean the associated political challenges of overcoming partisan opposition. No, he means the vital processes of industrial society for which we still have no zero-carbon alternative \u2014the as-yet-unsolved engineering problems that are key to zeroing out global greenhouse-gas pollution. Making concrete, for instance, causes 8 percent of the world\u2019s carbon-dioxide pollution, and we have no way to do it cheaply in a climate-friendly way\u2014that\u2019s one of Gates\u2019s hard problems. Heating and cooling buildings, which together emit 7 percent of greenhouse-gas pollution, are another. As is agriculture, responsible for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse-gas pollution each year. These hard problems are at the center of Gates\u2019s understanding of climate change and of his helpful new book, entitled How to Avoid a Climate Disaster . They\u2019ve led him to found Breakthrough Energy Ventures , a $2 billion investment fund for companies that want to solve difficult climate-change problems. A few weeks ago, when I had the chance to ask him about them, he expounded on a principle that I will, with journalistic presumption, now call \u201cthe Gates Rule.\u201d I think it is a useful tool, though not a perfect one, for understanding climate policy. When we spoke by Zoom, I was interested in the comparative importance of this \u201chard stuff.\u201d He was leaning back in his glass-walled office in Seattle; a harbor misted behind him.\u00a0 Say the United States had to decide , I said, between cutting greenhouse-gas pollution by using \u201ceasy\u201d technologies like solar power and making progress on harder problems such as reducing the cost of steel? Which should it choose? Gates is winsome but can be a meandering speaker; now he was blunt, and sat up. \u201cWell, the second one is all that counts!\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. still has, you know, easily the majority of all the innovation power on the globe. And so when the U.S. innovates in steel, that's working on 100 percent of steel emissions,\u201d he said. Subsidizing wind and solar deployment\u2014which Gates calls working on the \u201ceasy stuff\u201d\u2014only reduces America\u2019s dwindling share of global climate pollution, currently about 15 percent. This is the Gates Rule : If given a choice of cutting emissions directly or reducing the cost of net-zero technology, the U.S. should choose the latter. American climate policy, in other words, should optimize for cost-reducing innovation, not for direct cuts in carbon pollution. This is a more powerful idea than it may seem at first. When Republican leaders criticize climate policies, they tend to focus on America\u2019s relatively small percentage of present-day climate pollution and the limited impact even ambitious climate policy will have on future global temperatures. ( Here is Charles Koch , the conservative political donor, complaining that climate rules \u201cwill make very little difference in the future on what the temperature or weather will be.\u201d) Defenders of U.S. policies sometimes reply that many small policies add up to a meaningful overall change, and that, anyway, when the fate of the world is at stake, every tenth of a degree matters. The defenders are right\u2014but they (and Koch, for all his laissez flair) overlook something far more important: the working of the global economy. American climate policy matters because the American economy matters, and because America remains the place where technologies are invented, marketed, and mainstreamed.  Apple is here, of course, but so is the fracking industry, Disney, and Johnson and Johnson. You do not have to love modern-day capitalism to understand that America is an engine of global technological adoption. The prime goal of American climate policy is to harness that machine for the planet\u2019s sake\u2014 to reduce the cost of climate-friendly technologies so that the rest of the world can adopt them. Which brings us to the central and, I suspect, most enduring idea in Gates\u2019s book\u2014something he calls a \u201cgreen premium.\u201d A green premium is the cost difference between a newer, no-carbon technology and its older, dirtier equivalent. The electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, costs 10 more cents a mile to drive than a Chevy Malibu. Gates predicts that this premium will go to zero by 2030. More concerning: Conventional jet fuel costs $2.22 a gallon but advanced biofuels cost $5.35, he says. This means aviation carries a green premium of 141 percent, so it requires more attention. Cargo ships pose an even bigger challenge: Electrifying their fuel source, a murky oil called \u201cbunker fuel,\u201d has a green premium of more than 600 percent. While zeroing out a green premium will \u201cby and large\u201d resolve that industry\u2019s climate problem, Gates writes in the book, that shift isn\u2019t automatic. \u201cThere is usually a lag between the introduction of a new technology and its being deployed\u2014particularly for something like home furnaces, which we don\u2019t replace very often,\u201d he writes in his book. Green premiums allow a restatement of the Gates Rule: The goal of American climate policy should be to zero out green premiums as fast as possible, in as many industries as possible. To reach that goal, he is calling for government spending on energy and climate-related R&D to quintuple. Now for the asterisks. In The New York Times this weekend , the climate activist (and the inventor of climate journalism) Bill McKibben criticized Gates for failing to grasp that wind and solar energy are now cheaper than fossil alternatives, meaning they carry negative green premiums\u2014and yet are not being deployed anywhere near fast enough. Gates overlooks the importance of fossil-fuel opposition to net-zero energy, alleges McKibben. And it is true that Gates\u2019s politics are bloodless to the point of anemia. Near the end of our interview, I asked him: What should a young person do if they want to fight climate change? The \u201cbiggest contribution\u201d they could make, he replied, is studying physics, chemistry, the economy, and the history of the industrial sector. As for activism, he told me he sometimes jokes about the ultimate good that climate activism might do. \u201cSomebody asked me if these Extinction Rebellion people\u2014you know, they cause traffic jams, fortunately not in the U.S. as much, but sometimes in the U.K.: Is that helpful? And I say, well, sure. \u201cIf there\u2019s a guy in that traffic jam who happens to have a pencil and a piece of paper, and he takes his time to invent a new way of making steel, then it\u2019s just brilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we forced the guy to sit there, and not drive, but work on this problem.\u201d Our reader Nic Hawbaker shared these photos of a controlled burn of forest debris in Arizona. \u201cI live in Flagstaff, Arizona , where fortunately the forest service has been aggressively thinning the forest around our city,\u201d he writes. \u201cThese slash piles sat in the forest for the past 2 to 3 years, and they finally burned them after a heavy snowfall when fire risk is lowest. It\u2019s an eerie, beautiful sight seeing hundreds of bonfires burning in the winter outside your window for days on end. \u201d Nic was cross-country skiing with his daughter when he took these photos. Every week, I feature a weather photo from a reader or professional in this part of the newsletter, because the climate is someone else\u2019s weather. If you would like to submit one, please email weeklyplanet@theatlantic.com. Millions of Texans are without power because a rare but not unprecedented winter storm has taken down the state\u2019s power grid. This is a human catastrophe\u2014the state\u2019s homes are not designed to stay habitable without power for days of subfreezing temperatures\u2014that also reveals a governance failure. The country\u2019s two largest states can\u2019t keep the lights on in high wind (in California\u2019s case) or amid a polar vortex (in Texas\u2019s). It\u2019s striking and disconcerting: The power grid is a more important piece of infrastructure than the internet; it must become more crucial in the coming decades; and nobody seems to have good ideas about how to govern it . Here are a few resources I\u2019ve found helpful to understand the disaster: 1. \u201cThere are three grids in the Lower 48 states: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection\u2014and Texas.\u201d  Why does Texas even have its own power grid in the first place? This explainer from The Texas Tribune describes how the architects of the Texas grid made sure it avoided crossing state lines in order to prevent the federal government from regulating it. 2. A talking point has developed that the Texas grid shut down because wind turbines iced over. While wind hasn\u2019t performed spotlessly during the emergency, the state\u2019s grid operator has now clarified that \u201cfrozen instruments at gas, coal, and nuclear plants\u201d have caused the biggest problems. In other words, the state\u2019s existing fossil-fuel-dependent infrastructure was not built to hold up in sustained subfreezing weather. Supplies of natural gas also seem to be limited. If you\u2019re on Twitter, I recommend following the Princeton professor Jesse Jenkins and the Rice University professor Daniel Cohan , who have been live-tweeting data from the power grid through the crisis. 3. One of the weirdest aspects of this event is that Texas\u2019s grid can withstand surges of power demand during the summer\u2014even when the grid\u2019s 26 million customers all want to run their air conditioners at once. Why can Texas\u2019s grid hold up in the summer but not the winter? Joshua Rhodes, an energy scholar at the University of Texas at Austin, explains in a useful Forbes piece that electric cooling is an easier problem than heating, at least in Texas. In order to make a Texas dwelling comfortable and safe in 100-degree-Fahrenheit heat\u2014say, to bring it to 70 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014an AC unit must lower the indoor temperature by 30 degrees. But with overnight lows in Austin touching 10 degrees, heaters must now raise interior temperatures by 60 degrees to reach the same level. \u201cKeep in mind,\u201d he writes, \u201cour homes are designed with insulation for a 30F differential and a preference for shedding heat, not a 60F differential with a desire to retain heat.\u201d Climate advocates often say that our infrastructure isn\u2019t designed for the climate (or the growing society) of the future. But Texas shows that it\u2019s not designed particularly well for the present either. Thanks for reading. Did someone forward you this newsletter?

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change means the end of our world, but the beginning of another\u2014one with a new set of species and ecosystems. A few years ago in a lab in Panama, Klaus Winter tried to conjure the future. A plant physiologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, he planted seedlings of 10 tropical tree species in small, geodesic greenhouses. Some he allowed to grow in the kind of environment they were used to out in the forest, around 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Others, he subjected to uncomfortably high temperatures. Still others, unbearably high temperatures\u2014up to a daily average temperature of 95 degrees and a peak of 102 degrees. That\u2019s about as hot as Earth has ever been. It\u2019s also the kind of environment tropical trees have a good chance of living in by the end of this century, thanks to climate change. Winter wanted to see how they would do. The answer came as a surprise to those accustomed to dire warnings that climate change will turn the Amazon into a desert. The vast majority of Winter\u2019s seedlings didn\u2019t die. In fact, most thrived at significantly warmer temperatures than they experience today, growing faster and larger. Just two species succumbed to the heat, and only at the very highest temperatures. The trees\u2019 success echoes paleontological data , which hints that warmer temperatures can be a boon for tropical forests. After all, the last time Earth experienced average temperatures of 95 degrees, there were rainforests in Michigan and palm trees in the Arctic. That doesn\u2019t mean climate change won\u2019t affect tropical forests of today. It already is. And it definitely doesn\u2019t mean humans needn\u2019t worry about global warming. Climate change will be the end of the world as we know it. But it also will be the beginning of another. Mass extinctions will open ecological niches, and environmental changes will create new ones. New creatures will evolve to fill them, guided by unforeseen selection pressures. What this new world will look like, exactly, is impossible to predict, and humans aren\u2019t guaranteed to survive in it. (And that\u2019s if civilization somehow manages to survive the climate disasters coming its way in the meantime, from superstorms to sea-level rise to agriculture-destroying droughts). Still, experiments like Winter\u2019s offer a glimpse. Adapting to a warmer world will be long and painful process for the rainforest, and many species won\u2019t make it through. Even so, \u201cthere will still be tropical forests in 2100,\u201d says Simon Lewis , a plant ecologist at University College London and the University of Leeds. They will probably even contain many of the same species ecologists know today, including some of the trees in Winter\u2019s experiments. It\u2019s the relationships between those species, and the role each plays in the ecosystem, that will change\u2014and, in turn, transform the entire forest. \u201cThe forests that come out of this change are probably going to be much different than the kinds of forests we have today,\u201d says Christopher Dick , an evolutionary geneticist who studies tropical trees at the University of Michigan. Winter\u2019s data hints at one such change in forest structure. The three species that did the best under the highest temperature regime were the coralwood tree (Adenanthera pavonina) a species of fig tree called Ficus insipida, and the balsa tree (Ochroma pyramidale). Each is what Winter called \u201cpioneer species,\u201d fast-growing trees that can quickly move into cleared areas and take over. (F. insipida ups the ante, beginning life as vine that climbs up dead trees\u2014and also living ones, eventually strangling them.) These kinds of species are vital to a healthy rainforest, helping it regenerate after destructive events like a flood or the death and collapse of a large tree (when those things fall, they take out everything around them). But a mature rainforest needs the species that show up later, too. Those tend to be larger and longer-lived, stabilizing the forest and serving as ecological linchpins for insects, birds, monkeys, vines, and the rest of the ecosystem for decades or even centuries. And it was those so-called \u201cclimax species\u201d that suffered the most under higher temperatures in Winter\u2019s experiments. That suggests that as climax tree species die in a warmer forest, they won\u2019t be replaced. \u201cOne would expect that tropical futures of the future would be dominated by those nimble species that can disperse very well,\u201d Lewis says. Pioneer trees that will put down roots anywhere, vines that grow into every nook and cranny, small rodents that reproduce quickly and scurry far, birds that can fly over vast swaths of land and aren\u2019t too picky about where they nest. But that\u2019s a small subset of the thousands of species found in tropical forests today. Without the rest of them, the rainforest will be a much simpler place. Disturbingly, scientists have observed something similar happening in the ocean. Much of the carbon dioxide humans release into the atmosphere is eventually absorbed by the sea, gradually making the water more and more acidic. This process of ocean acidification can wreak havoc on marine invertebrates, dissolving their shells and then their fragile bodies. But just like in the tropical forest, \u201cthere are always the winners as well as the losers of climate change,\u201d says Ivan Nagelkerken , a marine ecologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia. To get an idea of which species might thrive under ocean acidification, he headed to two places where underwater vents already spew carbon dioxide into the sea: Vulcano Island in Italy and White Island in New Zealand. \u201cThese CO2 vents are natural laboratories where you can get a peek into the future,\u201d Nagelkerken explains. As in Winter\u2019s experiment, that future was far from lifeless . But the kind of life it supports has Nagelkerken worried. Carbon dioxide vents can occur in any marine ecosystem, from coral reefs to kelp forests to seagrass plains. But no matter where you are, life in the most acidic pockets looks strikingly similar. Immediately around a vent, all ecosystems \u201ctransform into systems that are dominated by turf algae\u2014very short, fleshy algae with very little structural complexity,\u201d Naglekerken explains. What\u2019s more, \u201cwe did not observe a single predator on those vents.\u201d As a result, the food web is dramatically simplified, the number of fish species drops, and the ecosystem becomes \u201cmuch less valuable and productive.\u201d Small grazing fish that love turf algae will probably excel in the acidic oceans of the future. But as they take over, \u201ceverywhere will start to look like everywhere else,\u201d Nagelkerken says. The new, homogenous ocean won\u2019t be good for humans. The fish that are likely to thrive in the oceans of the future\u2014small, adaptable species such as gobies and blennies\u2014are, simply, not fish people like to eat. And even if human tastes evolved, those fish wouldn\u2019t fill us up; most gobies clock in at fewer than 4 inches long. Humans like to eat big predators, like tuna and marlin\u2014exactly the kind of species that had disappeared from the CO2 vents Nagelkerken studied. As ocean acidification restructures marine ecosystems, the first to go will be the fish that people rely on for money and food. Of course, Homo sapiens may be the ultimate generalist, nimble enough to survive in almost every environment. \u201cWe\u2019re like cockroaches,\u201d Dick says. \u201cI think we\u2019ll stick around. We\u2019ll see the disaster we\u2019ve created.\u201d But the recovery? Maybe not. For the oceans to adapt to the new climate and regain a level of productivity they enjoy today, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be in a few generations,\u201d Nagelkerken says. \u201cYou could wait around for 10,000 years.\u201d Similarly, we might be long gone by the time the Amazon looks anything like the complex forest of today. The flip side of mass extinction, however, is rapid evolution . And if you\u2019re willing to take the long view\u2014like, the million-year long view\u2014there\u2019s a ray of hope to be found in today\u2019s rare species. The Amazon, in particular, is packed with plant species that pop up few and far between and don\u2019t even come close to playing a dominant role in the forest. But they might have treasure buried in their genes. Rare species\u2014especially those that are only distantly related to today\u2019s common ones\u2014\u201chave all kind of traits that we don\u2019t even know about,\u201d says Dick. Perhaps one will prove to thrive in drought, and another will effortlessly resist new pests that decimate other trees. \u201cThese are the species that have all the possibilities for becoming the next sets of dominant, important species after the climate has changed,\u201d Dick says. That\u2019s why humans can\u2019t cut them all down first, he argues. If rainforests are going to have a fighting chance of recovering their biodiversity and ecological complexity, those rare species and their priceless genes need to be ready and able to step into the spotlight. It might to be too late to save the world humanity knows and loves. But it can still do its best to make sure the new one is just as good\u2014someday.

{"id":null,"body":"\u201cThis is a supply-side problem. This is unlike any other market that any of us lumber traders have ever experienced.\u201d Last year, lumber turned into the surprise superstar of the U.S. economy when it briefly outperformed bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 to become \u201cthe hottest commodity on the planet.\u201d Now it\u2019s happening again. Yesterday, the market closed at more than $1,200 per thousand board feet, a surge in price with only one precedent in the decades-long history of lumber trading. Last year, I wrote about the role that climate change was playing in the lumber volatility . Its effects now seem even more pronounced. \u201cThe lumber price story is really a climate-change story,\u201d Stinson Dean, a lumber trader in Colorado, recently tweeted . He has argued that climate change has all but dictated the ongoing price rally, going so far as to call the lumber price a \u201cclimate price.\u201d To learn more, I talked with Dean, who sells to lumberyards from New Jersey to Texas. Friday was the \u201cthe busiest day of the year selling lumber,\u201d he said. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Robinson Meyer: Can you start by describing just what a lumber trader does? Stinson Dean: I buy lumber from the producers, and I own it for three or four months. A lot of that time is spent getting it produced, and moving it on a railcar from Prince George, British Columbia, to Dallas or Atlanta. And I make money when someone needs spruce inventory tomorrow. Traditionally a lumberyard is my customer. But with how crazy these markets are, you know, people are looking for lumber everywhere. So if you need to buy it, chances are, I\u2019ll probably sell it to you. Meyer: Can you bring us up to speed with what\u2019s happened in the lumber markets since the beginning of the pandemic? Dean: We set a new all-time, record-breaking high [for lumber] in August 2020\u2014it just wasn\u2019t making the news yet. Then we started a climb from Thanksgiving 2020 to May 2021. The price of lumber kept climbing, climbing, and climbing, until it got to be a little over $1,700 per thousand board feet. I would seriously equate this to $17 [a gallon for] gas. But then the whole thing fell apart over the summer [last year]. It took less than three months for it to drop . We got in the 400s briefly, but quickly rebounded and kind of chopped around $500 to $700. It started to go up again the week before Thanksgiving. And now \u2026 we\u2019re within striking distance of the all-time high again. We\u2019re trading at $1,300. It\u2019s crazy, crazy, crazy. Meyer: What had the historical price been? On average. Dean: Four hundred! The old rule of thumb when I got into the business is: You buy below $300 and you sell above $400. Meyer: This has been a really bizarre time for markets everywhere\u2014with the labor shortages, the variants, the supply-chain issues. Why are you so sure climate change is playing a role here? Dean: In the business, we call it fiber supply. It\u2019s the lack of fiber, wood fiber, in Canada. The vast majority of homes in the U.S. are built with Canadian lumber.  And British Columbia, Canada, is the No. 1\u2013producing region . So in 2009, 2010, the beetle-kill infestation\u2014the mountain pine beetle\u2014devastated Canadian forests. The beetles come around every year, but it did not get cold enough for long enough, too many years in a row, and too many survived. Beetle-kill lumber has a blue stain in it. For a while, almost every two-by-four seemed to have the blue stain. You can Google it\u2014\u201cblue stain\u201d was a decorative theme for a while because it kind of has a cool look to it. You\u2019ve got to harvest the beetle-killed trees before they rot, so they\u2019re still viable to be a legitimate structural piece of lumber. So the Canadian government opened up logging aggressively, and\u2014this is an important vocabulary word\u2014opened the annual allowable cut, the AAC. The AAC has impacted what we\u2019re going through now more than any single government policy, including federal interest rates. So they aggressively logged to capture all the beetle-kill trees. A lot of that lumber went to China\u2014China was the biggest demand for all raw materials coming out of the recession. It\u2019s not like we could\u2019ve left the trees standing and wait for the housing market to recover. But you can\u2019t cut all the trees, so now there\u2019s a huge fire risk. There are forest fires every year in Canada. That\u2019s expected. But the fire season in 2017 and 2018? Combined, those two fire seasons burned more hectares in British Columbia than in the past 20 years combined. Meyer: And were they tearing through beetle kill?  Dean: The beetle kill made it worse. It was like kindling. Meyer: What\u2019s happening to the AAC now? Dean: The AAC is why we have higher lumber prices, because the Canadian government owns 99 percent of the land up there. So the annual allowable cut was reduced below pre-beetle-kill levels in 2015. And ever since then, Canadian mills have been consolidating\u2014there\u2019s not enough wood for them all to survive. When I got into the industry coming on 10 years ago, Canadians kept telling us, \u201cWe can\u2019t sustain U.S. home starts.\u201d And I kept thinking, That\u2019s the Canadian sawmills talking their position . If we get to $500, $600 prices, there\u2019s plenty of wood out there, and you\u2019re going to start chopping it down, because those are great returns. Lumber producers are not a disciplined bunch. Whenever we got above $500, they would turn it on and we would go back to $400 or less. Like, every time. So in August 2020, we were all waiting for that\u2014it\u2019s going to $500, $600, $700, and I\u2019m looking around going, Hey, guys, where\u2019s the production? And we\u2019re going to $800, $900. So I started tweeting: This is a supply-side problem. This is unlike any other market that any of us lumber traders have ever experienced, where mills always had the capacity to just overproduce. I became a full believer in the fact that these mills are at capacity. Meyer: You mentioned that climate change contributed to the current rally, too? Dean: The week of Thanksgiving, British Columbia had an atmospheric river . Typically it\u2019s snow. But they had counter-seasonal, torrential rain in Vancouver and up into the lumber-producing region. And when you have fires, you don\u2019t have soil control, so now you have erosion\u2014and when it rains, you have mudslides and floods. And that is what started the second lumber rally. I think the second lumber rally was inevitable, but this started it early. You could pinpoint the bottom and the reversal in price to the pictures and the headlines of the flood. It destroyed not the trees, not the sawmill operations, but the infrastructure to get the lumber to market. And that\u2019s a problem if you\u2019re in Atlanta. Because you bought that lumber expecting it to get to you in six weeks, and now it\u2019s stuck. Stuff that was bought in November and supposed to ship in November, I\u2019m just now getting shipment notifications. So we\u2019re 10 weeks behind. Now, British Columbia is not the only lumber-producing region. Other regions have been able to profit off its plight. But there\u2019s just not enough wood to replace British Columbia being completely cut off in the marketplace. So I said on Twitter, the lumber price is a climate price. And the lumber-price story is a climate story.  If we had the beetle-killed trees still here, and our rail lines didn\u2019t get washed out, sawmills would be able to treat this market just like they did in 2006. The price would never get over $500, because they have all the capacity they need. I think the best comparison is how many homes we completed at the peak [of the last housing boom] and how many we complete now. In 2004, 2005, we completed 2 million homes a year. Now we\u2019re completing 1.3 million homes a year. The price of lumber has tripled, but we\u2019re producing 40 percent less homes. Something\u2019s wrong. Meyer: The classic explanation of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods. Usually, we say, okay, the Fed should raise interest rates and pull some dollars out of the system. But if climate change is causing a scarcity of goods, is raising rates going to help? Are there policies that would be helpful? Dean: Raising interest rates will blunt demand for housing\u2014no doubt. But if you blunt demand enough to bring lumber prices down, you\u2019re destroying the economy. For us to have lower lumber prices, we can only build a million homes a year. Do you really want to do that? No. Raising rates doesn\u2019t grow more trees. So the problem, when I look at it, is, how do we increase supply? Well, let\u2019s look at sustainable forest practices, culling, opening up national forests to strategic logging. We have natural resources in the Pacific Northwest that we haven\u2019t tapped since 1993. And we have to sustainably log that; it\u2019s actually dangerous not to. We have an overabundance of southern yellow pine trees that are not used to build homes. Can we improve the way we process southern yellow pine so it [can be used for home building]? If we\u2019re so dependent on Canadian lumber, what can we do on the margins to change building codes for the lumber we do have? Building codes require lumber with different strengths. The further north you go, trees grow stronger, because it's colder and the rings are tighter together. Can we look at some Canadian species other than the spruce? Can we use ponderosa pine from Washington? Building codes are local, so it\u2019s a big decentralized issue. Lastly, we put a tax on Canadian lumber as it comes across the U.S. border. I don\u2019t think if you just eliminated the tax tomorrow, prices would come down. But it would allow prices to get lower when lumber is cheap. Meyer: Thanks so much. Is there anything else we should talk about? Dean: Volatility is what makes markets. Extreme volatility, what we\u2019re experiencing, breaks markets. It\u2019s broken the supply chain. You can\u2019t forecast [prices]. When it comes to lumber, climate change has manifested itself in extreme volatility, lack of supply, and a paradigm shift in how lumber markets have behaved for decades. Lumber prices are the second highest they\u2019ve ever been, today, this moment\u2014 ever. And it was precipitated by mudslides, which was precipitated by burning, which was precipitated by beetle kill. There\u2019s an infrastructure story in there. There\u2019s a climate story.","headline":"Lumber Prices Are off the Rails Again.

{"id":null,"body":"The Democratic representative hasn\u2019t come up with a good rationale for challenging progressive Senator Ed Markey in Massachusetts. But with a name like his, it may not matter. WORCESTER, Mass.\u2014The words tumble out of Joseph Patrick Kennedy III so quickly that the sense of urgency, even an unintended hint of impatience, is impossible to miss. The red-haired representative from Massachusetts\u2014Joe, to just about everybody\u2014is an extremely fast talker. The characteristic might be beyond his control, but it also seems to fit the moment. On a sweltering Saturday afternoon, Kennedy is explaining to me, one more time, why he is running for Senate. \u201cI got in this race because we have major challenges we have to confront, and the current occupant of this seat is not doing all that he can to actually address it,\u201d Kennedy said of his opponent, the Democratic incumbent Senator Ed Markey. We\u2019re standing in the shade on a quiet street in a suburban area of Worcester, the once-industrial city about an hour west of Boston, and Kennedy pulls down his mask for occasional gulps of water. \u201cI got in this race and said, Let me show you and I\u2019ll prove it to you. Understanding that the burden\u2019s on me, let me prove it to you.\u201d Read: The last Kennedy A Kennedy from Massachusetts who wants to be a senator is about as common in New England as clam chowder on a diner menu. Joe\u2019s most famous great-uncles, John F. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy, held the same Senate seat for more than half a century. (Robert F. Kennedy, Joe\u2019s Brookline-born grandfather, was a senator from New York.) They all had to fight for their seats, at least initially, and Jack had to oust the scion of another Boston royal family, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., to join the Senate back in 1952. But Joe Kennedy, 39, is challenging a fellow Democrat and a staunch progressive, a longtime fighter against climate change and the co-author, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, of the Green New Deal. Kennedy\u2019s entry into the race last September came at the peak of progressive-primary fever, a year after Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts defeated long-serving House Democrats, and as another class of insurgents were mounting their campaigns. National progressive activists, including Ocasio-Cortez, have rallied behind Markey, but they find themselves in an unusual position: Rather than bolstering an insurgent, they\u2019re marshaling their resources to protect a long-serving incumbent against a better-funded, better-known challenger. They\u2019ve accused Kennedy of learning the wrong lesson from the left\u2019s 2018 primary victories and picking, in Markey, a target who should be rewarded for his record in office, not punished for his longevity. \u201cEd Markey is one of the most accomplished progressive senators that we have,\u201d Evan Weber, the political director of the Sunrise Movement, the youth-oriented grassroots organization advocating for action against climate change, told me. Read: The millennial era of climate politics has arrived Kennedy told me he was initially dismissive of entreaties to challenge Markey, a man he\u2019s known for his entire life and who served in the House alongside his father for a dozen years. \u201cI had no desire to commit career suicide,\u201d he said. In Kennedy\u2019s telling, he called around to Democrats across Massachusetts and heard a version of the same thing. \u201cTime and again, they said they haven\u2019t seen him in years,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe don\u2019t know him.\u201d The view from Markey\u2019s corner is less charitable. In late August last year, a poll conducted by a Democratic firm found that Kennedy was leading Markey by 17 points in a hypothetical primary matchup. The poll suggested the seat was Kennedy\u2019s for the taking, and the next month, he declared his candidacy. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should get rid of someone just because you can,\u201d Mayor Paul Heroux of Attleboro told me after Markey stopped in his city on the first leg of a bus tour on a recent Friday. Attleboro is a part of the district Kennedy has represented for the past eight years in the House, but Heroux, like many local Democratic officials throughout the state, is sticking with Markey. Kennedy\u2019s rationale also fell flat with national progressive activists. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how this is about anything more than Joe Kennedy\u2019s own career and his own political ambition,\u201d Weber told me. Read: What if Robert F. Kennedy had become president? Yet plenty of people run for office simply because they want the job. A compelling rationale beyond ambition isn\u2019t a requirement; it certainly hasn\u2019t been for Kennedys in Massachusetts. Kennedy\u2019s campaign sees the focus on his decision to challenge Markey\u2014and the attendant presumption that a solidly progressive senator automatically deserves renomination\u2014as a fixation of activists and insiders. Kennedy is betting that rank-and-file Democrats, especially those who don\u2019t follow every policy battle or vote in the Senate, will view the race more plainly. They\u2019ll see a choice between two good progressives, including one who is younger, more vigorous, and more famous than the other. When I met up with Kennedy\u2019s campaign in Brighton, the first person I spoke with happened to be a Markey supporter named Tim Sieber, a former ironworker who told me Markey should \u201cbe rewarded\u201d for his long progressive record. \u201cThe only thing Kennedy has going for him is his youth and energy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut,\u201d he added quickly, \u201che still may win.\u201d T he Kennedy-Markey clash, which culminates in a primary election on September 1, defies easy characterization. Markey has served in elected office for the past 47 years, but he\u2019s running as the candidate of the working class\u2014the son of a truck driver who sold ice cream to pay for college\u2014against a challenger from the moneyed elite. \u201cI can only run as a Markey from Malden,\u201d he told me in an interview. As he carefully returns to in-person campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic, his attire includes a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark slacks, and a conspicuous pair of well-worn Nikes the color of a Red Sox uniform. Markey is vulnerable chiefly because he\u2019s not as well known throughout the state as a typical Massachusetts senator\u2014certainly not like the Kennedys have been, or John Kerry, or Elizabeth Warren. Though Markey had represented a Boston district for 37 years in the House, he\u2019s been a senator serving the entire state for barely more than a single term, having replaced Kerry when he became the secretary of state in 2013. And before this campaign, he hadn\u2019t exactly been a ubiquitous presence back home in recent years. Markey owns a house in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and a person close to Kennedy told me that when Massachusetts lawmakers would board a plane together to Boston at the end of each week in Washington, Markey was the only member of the delegation who often stayed behind. In 2013, The Boston Globe  reviewed the water bills of Markey\u2019s home in Malden and found that they \u201csuggest he is there infrequently.\u201d He appears to be spending more time there now. In early June, a columnist for the paper \u201con a whim\u201d dropped by Markey\u2019s Malden home to find the senator standing in his driveway. \u201cWelcome to my compound!\u201d Markey said outside the modest, two-story house\u2014a sly reference to the famed Kennedy estate in Hyannis Port. He narrowly avoided an even bigger embarrassment earlier in the spring, when his campaign had to scramble to collect the signatures needed to put Markey\u2019s name on the primary ballot after the pandemic shut down traditional canvassing. The primary is not really an ideological battle or a referendum on progressivism\u2014the candidates broadly agree on the major issues\u2014nor is it strictly a generational challenge. Both the Massachusetts Democratic establishment and the progressive grassroots have rallied around a 74-year-old incumbent who, despite his leadership on climate change, has cast votes in the past that are now toxic on the left: for the Iraq War, for NAFTA, and for the 1994 crime bill, for example. Read: Jamaal Bowman is ready to join the squad Yet Kennedy, who has generally hewed close to the Democratic mainstream in his eight years in Congress, is no AOC (who\u2019s backing Markey), Pressley, or Jamaal Bowman, who knocked off a veteran Democratic committee chairman this month. All of them, in ideology and identity, represent a break with the predominantly white, male power structure that\u2019s stood atop a diversifying Democratic Party. Kennedy does not, and he\u2019s no underdog, either. Indeed, in all of America, there may be no greater embodiment of white privilege than the political heir to the Kennedy dynasty\u2014the son of a congressman; the grandson of RFK; educated at the private Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, then Stanford University. Kennedy did a stint in the Peace Corps, the program created by his great-uncle, President Kennedy; then, after earning his law degree at Harvard, he spent a few years working as a lawyer, before, at 32, easing into the House seat vacated by Representative Barney Frank. The factors behind the recent spate of primary wins on the left, however, go beyond ideology and identity. Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, and Bowman attacked their Democratic opponents from the left on policy, but they were all young, affable candidates who campaigned hard and who demonstrated, with their energy and aggressiveness, how they\u2019d be different from the entrenched incumbents they were challenging. On that score, Kennedy has more in common with them. Derek Thompson: Why do such elderly people run America? For all of the important policy debates that have convulsed the Democratic Party, charisma\u2014especially when combined with youth\u2014still goes a long way. In 2018, Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader, tapped Kennedy to deliver the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. After Democrats won back the House majority later that year, speculation about his next move ramped up, including talk that he would join the crowded field of candidates vying for the presidency. But he passed on the White House race and decided to challenge Markey instead. At Markey\u2019s stops along the state\u2019s south coast, supporters of both men spoke of that decision with disappointment more than anger. A few told me they had hoped he\u2019d wait for Senator Warren\u2019s seat to open up, should she become vice president or perhaps Treasury secretary in a Joe Biden administration next year. \u201cIt\u2019s been really frustrating for many of us Democrats,\u201d Ellen Farmer, a Markey supporter who had volunteered for Kennedy\u2019s congressional campaign, told me. Her friend Patricia Lafond-Valade, a retired nurse, added that she was \u201cannoyed\u201d Kennedy chose to run in a year when Democrats needed to be focused on winning back the White House and the Senate. \u201cI was like, We don\u2019t have time,\u201d she said. The reaction online has, predictably, been harsher. Progressives have flooded Kennedy\u2019s Twitter replies with critiques of his record, suggesting he\u2019s trying to claim the Senate seat as a sort of inheritance and calling him \u201cthe prince of privilege.\u201d An outcry on social media prompted a group of Broadway stars to back out of a planned fundraiser for Kennedy\u2019s campaign. \u201cLiterally my entire life, no matter what I\u2019ve done, people have leveled the criticism of \u2018You\u2019re doing this because you\u2019re a Kennedy.\u2019 Literally everything,\u201d Kennedy told me. \u201cSo I hear that. That is up to me to disprove.\u201d As for Markey, he said: \u201cYes, he came from more humble beginnings than I did, but he\u2019s also been in office for 50 years. That in and of itself is a position of privilege.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s rationale is both straightforward and, to many Massachusetts Democrats, pretty thin: He thinks Markey isn\u2019t doing enough, nationally or locally, and he would do better. \u201cThe job of a senator is more than the votes you cast and the bills you file,\u201d Kennedy uses as a refrain, meant to rebut Markey\u2019s recitation of a solidly progressive voting record. His implication is that a senator from Massachusetts, like Warren, Kerry, and, yes, the Kennedys, needs to be a star, a national movement leader. Read: The protests are already changing elections Markey\u2019s partnership with Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal blunts that critique. \u201cYou have to do both, and I have done both,\u201d Markey told me. To Kennedy loyalists, though, Markey\u2019s role in the formation of the Green New Deal is overstated, the work of a savvy politician protecting his base ahead of an election. \u201cHe signed on to something that AOC and the Sunrise Movement created,\u201d Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told me. A bigger problem for Kennedy is that, over the course of four terms in Congress, he\u2019s been no more a star in the House than Markey has been in the Senate. He hasn\u2019t been a trailblazer in the mold of Bernie Sanders or Warren, or even as assertive as Ocasio-Cortez. He\u2019s treaded carefully on policy\u2014he did not initially embrace Medicare for All, for example, and he\u2019s been a latecomer, especially given his relative youth, to the cause of marijuana legalization. Kennedy\u2019s biggest turn in the national spotlight, his response to Trump\u2019s address\u2014was bestowed on him by party leaders. When I asked Weber, of the Sunrise Movement, to respond to Kennedy\u2019s charge that Markey, beyond his recent role in launching the Green New Deal, had been a lackluster progressive voice, he scoffed. \u201cThat\u2019s just kabooey,\u201d he replied, before rattling off a number of Markey crusades, including his early-1980s battle to end the nuclear arms race. But Weber also turned the question of whether Markey had been enough of a leader around on the challenger. \u201cFirst of all, I would ask: Has Joe Kennedy?\u201d B efore the pandemic, Kennedy\u2019s campaign plan had been simple: He\u2019d out-hustle Markey on the stump. He\u2019d show Massachusetts Democrats, by the sheer ubiquity of his presence across the state, that he\u2019d be the more energetic, harder-working fighter for progressive causes. The stay-at-home orders forced both campaigns inside, but they hurt Kennedy even more. \u201cCampaigning on Zoom sucks,\u201d Kennedy told me when I met up with his \u201cJobs and Justice\u201d tour outside a Brazilian restaurant in Brighton, where he posed alongside union workers at a food drive. Recent polls show a narrower race, and Markey has caught up to Kennedy in fundraising. The Markey campaign\u2019s early dreams of bringing Ocasio-Cortez in for huge rallies with the senator may be dead, but a late push from the progressives could still lift him over the top. (Ocasio-Cortez filmed a TV ad for Markey that the campaign released last week.) The Kennedy campaign is making a big drive for lower-income and minority voters, hoping to convince them that Markey is disconnected from inner-city and rural communities in Western Massachusetts. The race\u2019s many televised debates\u2014there have already been several, with two more to come\u2014have gotten punchier. In June, Markey called Kennedy a \u201cprogressive in name only,\u201d hitting him for initially opposing Medicare for All proposals and for working for a conservative district attorney in Cape Cod after law school. As the Black Lives Matter protests surged across the nation, Kennedy raised Markey\u2019s record on race in an echo of the presidential-primary attacks on Biden. \u201cI have a hard time taking criticism of who\u2019s more progressive from a guy who was against the integration of the Boston public schools,\u201d he told me. Read: America\u2019s elections won\u2019t be the same after 2020 As the state has gradually reopened this summer, Kennedy has been more aggressive about relaunching his in-person campaign and interacting with potential voters\u2014social distancing be damned at times. Markey debuted a campaign bus that will serve as a rolling billboard but, because of the pandemic, carry far fewer passengers than the 56 it could fit inside. And although Markey (who, at 74, is in a higher-risk category) kept his events outdoors and tightly controlled, Kennedy was a bit more lax. On the day I spent with him in Worcester, he toured an indoor food market, bumping fists and elbows with cooks and cashiers as he sampled dumplings and sipped an iced tea. (He pulled down his N95 mask only to drink and eat.) Afterward, he ventured inside a Mexican restaurant, where he squeezed in tight for photos with the owners as a couple dozen mostly masked supporters and patrons crowded around to watch. An exuberant employee went in for a forbidden handshake, and Kennedy obliged. The Kennedy mystique caught up with him at points too. Kathy Gleason, 56, ran up excitedly to Kennedy at the market to ask for a photo. As she left, she told her friends waiting outside, \u201cI could have kissed him, he\u2019s so cute.\u201d Gleason told me that fond memories of working with Joe\u2019s uncle, Robert Kennedy Jr., in the 1990s were a big reason she was supporting him. Later in the afternoon, Rosanna Swillo, 67, was waiting for Kennedy when he went canvassing around the Worcester neighborhood where she lived. She handed him a copy of a diary that one of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s college roommates\u2014a family friend of hers\u2014had kept as he rode the funeral train for RFK, and which mentioned Joe\u2019s father, then a teenager. When Kennedy went to visit a new Black Lives Matter mural in the city, however, the response was chillier. A couple of Markey supporters confronted him to ask why he was running. And a Black activist, Chantel Bethea, chastised him to return without reporters and cameras in tow. \u201cHe\u2019s shown up to a lot of things. He\u2019s trying and he\u2019s listening,\u201d she told me of Kennedy. But she wasn\u2019t particularly excited about either primary candidate. \u201cThey\u2019re both white,\u201d Bethea said. \u201cWhat I want to see is Black people at the forefront.\u201d State Representative Nika Elugardo is a Black progressive who defeated an entrenched Democratic incumbent in 2018. When I spoke with her by phone, she acknowledged one of Kennedy\u2019s main arguments against Markey\u2014that the senator is \u201cdisconnected\u201d from communities of color back home and focused too much on his legislative work in Washington. But she\u2019s still supporting Markey, noting that he \u201chas the ability to own the places where he needs to grow.\u201d Elugardo told me she called Kennedy when he declared his candidacy. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you would run against Ed Markey,\u201d she told him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a good reason.\u201d Come September, Kennedy might find that he didn\u2019t need one. And most Markey supporters, despite some disappointment and annoyance, will probably be fine with that. Neither candidate is really tearing the other apart, and unlike the fall presidential election, no one is saying the fate of the commonwealth hangs in the balance. Whether it\u2019s Markey or Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrats are likely to have a reliable progressive vote in the Senate. History also suggests that any party rift will heal: After all, Ted Kennedy challenged a sitting Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, in 1980, and by the end of his life\u2014 despite myriad transgressions \u2014was hailed as a lion of the Senate and Massachusetts politics. The coming month in Massachusetts will show whether the Kennedy cachet remains strong enough to elevate the family\u2019s next generation into the upper echelon of American politics. But the Kennedy-Markey primary is more significantly a test for the progressive grassroots, and whether it can muster the same energy to protect a long-serving incumbent as it has in boosting young, insurgent challengers. Joe Kennedy is betting that his urgency\u2014yes, even impatience\u2014can, along with that famous name, overcome a much longer electoral record of progressivism. \u201cMarkey\u2019s been great,\u201d Charles Neulist, a 65-year-old ironworker from Amesbury, told me in Brighton. He\u2019s backing Kennedy, however. \u201cWe\u2019d just like a change\u2014younger blood, new ideas,\u201d he said. Neulist meant it as no knock on the gray-haired Democrat he\u2019d be ushering out to pasture. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s retirement.\u201d","headline":"Why Is Joe Kennedy Doing This?","article_name":614587.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/08\/kennedy-markey-massachusetts-senate\/614587\/","date_published":"2020-08-04 13:47:21","article_length":20005,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:42.255275","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/08\/kennedy-markey-massachusetts-senate\/614587\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A growing body of research suggests that models of the warming world have underestimated a crucial ingredient: vegetation. When Abigail Swann started her career in the mid-2000s, she was one of just a handful of scientists exploring a potentially radical notion: that the green plants living on Earth\u2019s surface could have a major influence on the planet\u2019s climate. For decades, most atmospheric scientists had focused their weather and climate models on wind, rain, and other physical phenomena. But with powerful computer models that can simulate how plants move water, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals between ground and air, Swann has found that vegetation can control weather patterns across huge distances. The destruction or expansion of forests on one continent might boost rainfall or cause a drought halfway around the world. Swann is now a professor at the University of Washington, where she runs the Ecoclimate Lab. She is in the vanguard of a small but growing group of scientists studying how plants shape Earth\u2019s weather and climate. Their results could shake up climate science. \u201cNone of the atmospheric scientists are thinking about\u201d how plants could influence rainfall, Swann said, though hints have appeared in the scientific literature for decades. And, she added, \u201cit blows the ecology community\u2019s mind \u2026 that the plants over here could actually influence the plants over there.\u201d \u201cMany of us are surprised at what a powerful role plants actually play,\u201d said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University. \u201cThe influence of Earth\u2019s surface on large-scale climate is currently a really booming topic, and Abby Swann is one of the emerging leaders in that field.\u201d The schism between the atmospheric and life sciences that Swann encountered was a holdover from the late 1800s, when the U.S. government proclaimed that planting crops and trees would turn the arid Great Plains wet. The government had embraced a dubious theory pushed by land speculators and rejected the counsel of one of the nation\u2019s top scientists, John Wesley Powell. Spurred on by such optimistic but dubious claims, thousands of would-be farmers headed west, only to find that greening the land did not, in fact, make it rain. Many struggled to scrape a living from the dry ground, and the ill-conceived agricultural experiment eventually contributed to the devastating Dust Bowl. Scientists reacted strongly. Early meteorologists, hoping to save their young field\u2019s credibility, rejected the notion that forests influence weather. \u201cMuch of the discussion of it, unfortunately, has not been of a purely scientific character,\u201d one wrote in 1888 in Science . Meteorology, and later climate science, became the study of air and water. Plants were relegated to passive-participant status. Atmospheric scientists\u2014and everyone else\u2014could be excused for thinking of a stoically standing tree or a gently undulating wheat field as doing little more than passively accepting sunlight, wind, and rain. But plants are actually powerful change agents on the planet\u2019s surface. They pump water from the ground through their tissues to the air, and they move carbon in the opposite direction, from air to tissue to ground. All the while, leaves split water, harvest and manipulate solar energy, and stitch together hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon to produce sugars and starches\u2014the sources of virtually all food for Earth\u2019s life. The key features of this molecular wizardry are pores, called stomata, in plant leaves. A single leaf can contain more than 1 million of these specialized structures. Stomata are essentially microscopic mouths that simultaneously take in carbon dioxide from the air and let out water. As Swann notes, the gas exchange from each stoma\u2014and indeed from each leaf\u2014is, on its own, tiny. But with billions of stomata acting in concert, a single tree can evaporate hundreds of liters of water a day\u2014enough to fill several bathtubs. The world\u2019s major forests, which contain hundreds of billions of trees, can move water on almost inconceivably large scales. Antonio Nobre, a climate scientist at Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, has estimated, for example, that the Amazon rainforest discharges around 20 trillion liters of water a day\u2014roughly 17 percent more than even the mighty Amazon River. Yet the computer models that scientists rely on to predict the future climate don\u2019t even come close to acknowledging the power of plants to move water on that scale, Swann said. \u201cThey\u2019re tiny, but together they are mighty.\u201d Read: Forest animals are living on the edge. Scientists have known since the late 1970s that the Amazon rainforest\u2014the world\u2019s largest, at 5.5 million square kilometers\u2014 makes its own storms . More recent research reveals that half or more of the rainfall over continental interiors comes from plants cycling water from soil into the atmosphere, where powerful wind currents can transport it to distant places. Agricultural regions as diverse as the U.S. Midwest, the Nile Valley, and India, as well as major cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, get much of their rain from these forest-driven \u201cflying rivers.\u201d It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that a large fraction of humanity\u2019s diet is owing, at least in part, to forest-driven rainfall. Such results also imply a profound reversal of what we would usually consider cause and effect. Normally, we might assume that \u201cthe forests are there because it\u2019s wet, rather than that it\u2019s wet because there are forests,\u201d said Douglas Sheil, an environmental scientist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences campus outside Oslo. But maybe that\u2019s all backwards. \u201cCould [wet climates] be caused by the forests?\u201d he asked. Swann arrived at UC Berkeley in 2005 to do her doctoral work with Inez Fung, an atmospheric scientist. In the 1980s, Fung had helped pave the way for climate models that included realistic vegetation and associated carbon-dioxide fluxes. (Among her other accomplishments, she was a co-author on the 1988 paper with the NASA scientist James Hansen that helped bring climate change to the public\u2019s attention.) The model she worked with was state of the art at the time, but, like its counterparts at other research institutions, it could only represent the biosphere simplistically. By the mid-2000s, models had improved enough that scientists could more precisely study the role plants might play in the climate system. Fung suggested that Swann try foresting the Arctic in a climate model. Trees are colonizing higher latitudes as the globe warms, so it seemed reasonable to ask what impact they would have on the region\u2019s climate. Other researchers had previously looked into the potential effects of an expansion of northern spruce forests; unsurprisingly, they found that the Arctic would likely get warmer because those trees\u2019 leaves are dark and would absorb more sunlight than virtually any of the tundra, ice, and shrubs they might replace. Swann decided to look into what would happen if the encroaching forests were deciduous trees with lighter-colored leaves, such as birch or aspen. In her model, the Arctic did still warm \u2014by about 1 degree Celsius, which was more than she expected. Swann determined that her simulated forests emitted a lot of water vapor, which, like carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas that absorbs infrared radiation from Earth and redirects some of it downward. The vapor then caused ice to melt on land and at sea, exposing darker surfaces that absorbed yet more sunlight and grew even warmer. The new forests had set off a feedback loop, amplifying the impact of climate change. The finding hinted at the power that plants could exert over a region\u2019s climate. In a separate study, Swann turned all vegetated areas of temperate North America, Europe, and Asia into forest. Again, this exercise exaggerated something already happening in the real world: Satellite data have shown that these continents are greening as former farmland returns to forest, perhaps aided by enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide and longer growing seasons. As in the Arctic study, the new trees absorbed sunlight and warmed, adding energy to the climate system. Atmospheric currents then redistributed this energy around the planet. Droughts descended on the southern Amazon and rain fell in the Sahara. These effects were caused by a repositioning of the Hadley cell\u2014the massive conveyor belt of air that rises from the equator, dumps its rain over the tropics, and descends again as dry air at around 30 degrees north and south latitudes, where most of the world\u2019s deserts are. Through the influence of plants alone, the Hadley cell had shifted to the north. Swann had seemingly uncovered a hidden \u201cteleconnection\u201d\u2014a region holding sway over a far distant one through subtle atmospheric mechanisms. Fung wasn\u2019t that surprised: Atmospheric scientists have gotten comfortable with such remote influences. In periodic El Ni\u00f1o events, which have been understood since the 1920s, unusually warm surface water in the eastern Pacific Ocean triggers heavy rain in western South America and Africa and droughts in Southeast Asia and Australia. The novelty in Swann\u2019s simulated events was that forests, not oceans, did the influencing. \u201cTo me, that was a really interesting perspective,\u201d said Gordon Bonan, a geoscientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, who also studies the influence of plants on the atmosphere. \u201cIf you do enough of this tree planting, you can actually change circulation patterns.\u201d Scenarios such as a green Arctic or a reforested temperate zone are not as far-fetched as they may seem. A recent study in Nature reported that in the past three and a half decades, tree cover has increased by more than 2 million square kilometers in these regions. Massive tree losses are also part of our modern world. During roughly the same period when temperate and boreal trees gained ground, some 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest was cut down. Since 2010, nearly 130 million trees have died in California alone, mostly because of drought and wildfire. Read: Will Northern California soon have Southern California\u2019s climate? Much effort has gone into understanding how future climate change will affect forests. Based on severe droughts that occurred in 2005, 2010, and 2015, some scientists believe the Amazon may be nearing a tipping point that would cause much of its rainforest to turn to savanna, with potentially devastating consequences for carbon storage, biodiversity, and local climate. A paper from late 2017 provided evidence that future warming would make droughts even more lethal to the forests of the American Southwest. Some scientists predict that many of the Southwest\u2019s forests could become savanna or grasslands, and at least one\u2014 Nate McDowell at Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2014has been quoted as saying that a large fraction of the region\u2019s trees could die. Yet the question of how changes in forests could alter the global climate has barely been considered. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve been looking to see: How well can we do in climate modeling without needing to evoke the influences of vegetation?\u201d Williams said. \u201cVegetation has kind of been left on the back burner.\u201d Swann\u2019s and Fung\u2019s research suggested that plants need to be brought to the fore. And other researchers have taken note. Earlier this year, two groups of scientists, both of which included Swann, authored studies of how forest-driven water transport will change as carbon dioxide levels rise. Studies of individual leaves have shown that when plants are bathed in carbon dioxide, they don\u2019t need to make as many stomata per leaf, and they close the ones they do make more of the time. These changes help forest plants conserve water to survive, but they reduce the water vapor available to fall as rain on the surrounding continent. Moreover, when plants transpire, they cool Earth\u2019s surface and warm the air, just as the evaporation of sweat cools your body on a hot day. Leaf-level changes, scaled up across continents, could rob the atmosphere of moisture and warm the planet\u2019s surface. To Michael Pritchard, a climatologist at the University of California at Irvine, Swann\u2019s results were \u201cvery provocative \u2026 and a big wake-up call,\u201d he said. \u201cThis effect seemed to be rewriting the maps of the drought-severity outlook in the future.\u201d Pritchard said he hadn\u2019t previously been aware of the stomatal-closure effect. The knowledge inspired him to join a group led by Gabriel Kooperman, a climate scientist then at UC Irvine, investigating the future effects of enhanced carbon dioxide over the three major tropical forest regions\u2014the Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia. In a study published in Nature Climate Change in April, the researchers found that the closing of stomata would cause half the rainfall changes the regions would see by 2100. Moreover, the Amazon\u2014home to the world\u2019s most carbon-rich and biodiverse rainforest\u2014would get hit with the most severe declines. Swann is now probing the effects of forest changes at different scales. In a 2016 paper , she reported that wiping out forests in western North America made forests in eastern South America grow more vigorously, while reducing growth in Europe. And in a study published in May, she investigated how U.S. forest die-offs would affect forests elsewhere in the country. In her models, she killed off forests in 13 heavily forested regions that the National Science Foundation has identified as being ecologically distinct. The results were dramatic. When she wiped out trees in the Pacific Southwest, forests in the Midwest and eastern United States suffered. In recent years, the Pacific Southwest has, in fact, lost an estimated 100 million trees, mostly to droughts and voracious insects. The effects of forest die-off can also be positive, however. In Swann\u2019s study, removing trees from the mid-Atlantic actually helped forests elsewhere, by making those regions\u2019 summers cooler or wetter. Swann emphasizes that this does not mean people should cut down forests, which provide innumerable benefits beyond their influence on other regions, including carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and water filtration. But she notes that environmental groups often plant trees as a climate solution without considering whether the trees could harm forests elsewhere\u2014or warm the planet by absorbing solar energy. Massive government-sponsored tree plantings have taken place in China and the African Sahel, for example. No one knows what effects they have had on the global climate. \u201cWhat we would like to be able to say is, if you plant this amount of trees, you would see this reduction in planetary warming,\u201d Bonan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really quite have that answer yet.\u201d For Swann, it was a thrill to see any effect. \u201cThe smaller down in scale we go, I thought it would be harder and harder to identify these climate responses and subsequent forest responses,\u201d she said. \u201cThese smaller forest losses still do have big impacts, and actually the impact doesn\u2019t just scale with the tree area that\u2019s lost.\u201d Not everyone is sold on ecoclimate teleconnections. Sheil is skeptical of the results of the Kooperman-led study. He thinks climate models do not represent plant biology and the physics of air movement and rainfall accurately enough to say anything meaningful about the real biological world. He notes, for example, that different climate models given the same input often make different predictions. Others point out that ecoclimate researchers have relied largely on one model, the Community Earth System Model, or CESM. Typically, climate scientists aren\u2019t convinced that a phenomenon is real until they have seen it in the output of numerous models; for instance, the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report will incorporate results from more than 30 models. It\u2019s possible that the CESM may be unusually sensitive to vegetation, Pritchard said. Swann adds a critique of her own: She and her colleagues haven\u2019t always been able to piece together the full chain of physical causation through which forests influence distant regions in her models. In her recent paper on U.S. forests, for example, there were too many disparate mechanisms to investigate one by one, she said. The situation is reminiscent of the hypothetical butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil and setting off a tornado in Texas: Swann and her colleagues can set the butterfly fluttering and see the tornado take shape, but they don\u2019t fully understand what happens in between. Elucidating such mechanisms will be a focus of future work. Addressing these concerns won\u2019t happen overnight, however. Most models, unlike the CESM, can only be run at a modeling center by the handful of scientists who created them. Those people are busy running simulations for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, due out in 2022. None of the models being used fully accounts for plants\u2019 influence on climate, Swann said. The historical view that climate science is mainly about physical phenomena still has influence. For more than a decade, climatologists have seen clouds as the biggest source of uncertainty in models. Clouds cool the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight, but they also warm the planet because they are made of water vapor, a greenhouse gas. Models differ wildly on how much clouds will contribute to cooling and warming in the future, and thus whether a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide will be problematic but manageable, or catastrophic. Read: The best technology for fighting climate change? Trees. But how much rain will fall in a given region, and when, and how much it will vary season to season and year to year will make all the difference in determining which places will remain livable and which places won\u2019t. And Swann\u2019s and Fung\u2019s results open up at least the possibility that plants could have as much effect as cloud physics on nailing down the answers to such questions. Moreover, Fung points out, the problems aren\u2019t even independent: Forests produce clouds. Without an accurate picture of forests, cloud models will remain incomplete. That\u2019s why Swann is starting a new project: to try to quantify how much plants contribute to the uncertainty in climate-model results. With that number in hand, she may have an even more potent tool for convincing other researchers that ecology and atmospheric science are inseparable. Another potential project involves looking at forest data for observational evidence of the teleconnections found in modeling studies. Swann admits, however, that she\u2019s \u201ca little bit on the more skeptical side\u201d that such signals will emerge amid the many pushes and pulls that forests experience. She and David Breshears, an ecologist at the University of Arizona and one of her co-authors on the U.S. forest paper, are also exploring how future southwestern forest losses will affect the climate of the Midwest, the nation\u2019s breadbasket and one of the most productive agricultural areas on Earth. One thing is clear already: Swann\u2019s influence is being felt. In just over a decade, ecoclimate teleconnections have gone from being virtually unknown to appearing as a frequent discussion topic at major scientific meetings such as the Ecological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union. No longer are such ideas dismissed as not being \u201cof a purely scientific character.\u201d The developments in this new research area demonstrate that future climate scientists will need to master two fields that have, for more than a century, been largely separate, Fung said: atmospheric physics and biology. \u201cThere are very few \u2018multilingual\u2019 scientists,\u201d Fung said. \u201cWhen Abby did her thing, it was the coming together of two disciplines.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s how progress is made.\u201d","headline":"Trees Could Change the Climate More Than Scientists Thought","article_name":572770.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/how-forests-affect-climate-change\/572770\/","date_published":"2018-10-13 12:00:00","article_length":19836,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:42.848539","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/how-forests-affect-climate-change\/572770\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate change will mean more insects, and less food for humans. Since the dawn of agriculture, humans have been unwillingly nourishing insects by growing plants that they then devour. Their mandibles consume somewhere between 10 and  20  percent of crops produced around the world. And these losses are likely to grow as the world slowly warms. By looking at how insects will respond to rising temperatures, a team of researchers led by Curtis Deutsch and Joshua Tewksbury have calculated how rice, maize, and wheat\u2014which provide 42 percent of humanity\u2019s calories\u2014will fare as the globe heats up. The results aren\u2019t pretty. They estimate that the portion of these grains that\u2019s lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25 percent for every extra degree Celsius of warming. Some predictions say that we can almost certainly expect  2 degrees of warming by the end of the century. If that happens, and the team\u2019s calculations are accurate, then every year, the burgeoning legions of insects will deprive the world of a further 19 million metric tons of wheat, 14 million metric tons of rice, and 14 million metric tons of maize. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the collapse of agriculture, but we\u2019re talking about significant losses,\u201d says Deutsch, who works at the University of Washington. Even if insects do nothing, warming temperatures are already likely to affect plants directly and reduce crop yields by around five percentage points per degree of warming, according to Deutsch. The losses triggered by insects will likely add on top of those, reducing yields by another two to four percentage points. Put it this way: If a farmer is currently growing 100 tons of grain per hectare, she\u2019d likely get just 84 tons in a world that\u2019s 2 degrees warmer. Solar geoengineering can\u2019t save the world\u2019s crops. If anything, May Berenbaum , an entomologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, thinks that those figures are probably underestimates. \u201cThree decades of studies have shown that elevated carbon dioxide and temperatures can lower the nutritional quality of certain plants, and decrease the ability of plants to produce toxins to protect themselves,\u201d she says. Both factors might drive insects to devour crops even more readily than they otherwise would. Still, she commends the team\u2019s attempt to put some figures on the future impact of crop pests. So far, scientists have tried to estimate how crops might react to climate change by focusing entirely on the plants themselves . Very rarely have they turned their attention to the pests that eat those plants, and never have they done so at a global scale. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that this aspect of climate change has received so little attention,\u201d Berenbaum says. In thinking about insects, Deutsch and his team focused on two big patterns. First, insects burn calories at a faster rate when their environment heats up, which forces them to eat more food. This is a straightforward trend that\u2019s been documented in a number of earlier experiments, with a wide range of pest species. As the future gets hotter, the very hungry caterpillar is going to be even hungrier. The second pattern is more complicated: Insect populations grow fastest at certain optimal temperatures\u2014neither too hot nor too cold. Those that live in the tropics tend to live at those temperatures already. Their numbers will probably grow more slowly as the climate heats up, which will partly mitigate their expanding appetites. That\u2019s good news for rice, which is mostly grown in tropical environments. Losses will still rise with temperatures, but to a lesser degree than for the other crops. But in temperate parts of the world, insects mostly live in cooler-than-ideal conditions. \u201cSome of them go through a dormant state in the winter, and more of them will make it through a winter that\u2019s warmer,\u201d explains Deutsch. \u201cAnd when they emerge, they develop and reproduce faster because their metabolic rates are higher.\u201d This is especially bad news for wheat, which is mostly grown in cool climates. Wheat growers will face more insects, which will also want to eat more to support their metabolisms. \u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Deutsch says. By simulating these changes across the globe, the team calculated that the most productive agricultural regions will also be the most severely affected, with France, China, and the United States suffering the brunt of the incipient wave of pests. But the consequences of a global decline in grain will likely have the biggest effects on the poorest nations and households\u2014those that are already living on a nutritional knife-edge. Many factors, for which there is little data, could complicate and change the team\u2019s estimates. For example, \u201cthe team don\u2019t seem to have considered the influence of warming on the predators of these pests,\u201d says Navin Ramankutty , who studies food security at the University of British Columbia. Along with hunters like spiders, every insect is targeted by at least one species of body-snatching parasitic wasp , which helps to keep their numbers in check. \u201cIf they also respond positively to warming, that might somewhat mute the impact of the crop pests themselves,\u201d Ramankutty says. Many pest insects also rely on bacterial symbionts that help them to digest their meals or provide them with essential nutrients. There\u2019s a smattering of evidence that some of these microbes are very sensitive to high temperatures, which might again limit their hosts\u2019 ability to thrive in the heat. And of course, extreme weather, from heat waves to droughts, might kill insect pests directly. Finally, insects can obviously move . Besides changing their behavior to avoid the hottest part of the day, over time, entire populations could also move to new locations, tracking temperate climates northward as many animals are already known to do . These changes could have unknown consequences for the overlaps between pests and crops. American trees are moving west, and no one knows why. These intricacies might change the degree of the losses that Deutsch predicts, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that they might wipe away those losses entirely. This, he says, is the time to start preparing, whether through agricultural practices like crop rotations, or by applying pesticides , or by planting genetically modified crops . \u201cBut preventing climate change is the thing I would first turn to,\u201d he adds. \u201cHumanity faces this food-security chal\u00adlenge at a time when training and job op\u00adportunities for expert entomologists are shrinking,\u201d writes Markus Riegler from Western Sydney University in an accompanying editorial . \u201cThese experts are urgently needed\u201d to deal not just with the problem of pests, but also with threats to insect biodiversity. Most of the millions of species of insects are not pests. They are the linchpins of many ecosystems. They\u2019re sources of food for birds, and carriers of pollen for plants. If insects decline, ecosystems everywhere will too. And insects are declining , even in protected areas worldwide. As I wrote in The Atlantic  last year , \u201cInsects are the most diverse and numerous group of animals on the planet. If they\u2019re in trouble, we\u2019re all in trouble.\u201d","headline":"The Very Hot, Very Hungry Caterpillar","article_name":568978.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/climate-change-insects-crops\/568978\/","date_published":"2018-08-30 18:00:00","article_length":7175,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:43.060234","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/climate-change-insects-crops\/568978\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"North America is witnessing the largest pine-beetle epidemic in recorded history. Temperature rises are more than likely to blame, but why is it so hard to admit that? A Mountain Pine beetle is seen during the examination of trees in the White River National Forest near Vail, Colorado. (AP) DILLON, Colo.--Dan Gibbs keeps dead beetles in the back of his beat-up Chevy Silverado. He has a wooden block with beetles impaled on it, each insect about the size of a grain of rice. He's got vials of embalmed beetles and their larvae. He carries around pieces of wood that show what those tiny beetles do to a mature lodgepole pine: They drill deep into the trunk and infect the tree with a fatal fungus that stains its wood blue. Gibbs isn't a scientist. He's a commissioner for Summit County, a high-altitude slice of Colorado that's gaining fame as a ground zero, of sorts, for an epidemic that has devastated pine forests across North America. Twenty years ago, the mountainsides around Dillon were a lush green; these days, they're gray with needle-less trees. The pine-beetle epidemic provides perhaps the most visual evidence of climate change in the United States. But that evidence, while arresting, remains circumstantial. Scientific studies linking the factors that drove the epidemic to rising global temperatures haven't convinced everyone, let alone prompted people here to forsake fossil fuels. It isn't just the dead trees. Here, near the headwaters of the Colorado River, the snow is melting earlier--and there's less of it. Summers are drier. Threats of wildfire and water shortages have grown, changing lives and livelihoods in Colorado and across the West. Still, it's not simple to draw a bright line from observable phenomena to climate change. For some policymakers, the lack of clarity is frustrating. Mounting evidence that the planet is warming and that human activity is to blame hasn't generated any sort of political momentum for action, even as, in places like Dillon, forests are dying in plain sight. As people here struggle to understand the beetle epidemic, the term \"climate change\" has become so inflammatory that few even utter it. It's also unclear to residents what, exactly, they would accomplish by reducing their fossil-fuel use. Without a more far-ranging plan of attack on a national--indeed, international--scale, all that people in Dillon and places like it can do is adapt to changing circumstances. Gibbs keeps beetles in the back of his pickup to teach people about forest health, not to start a conversation about climate change. (And he, like almost everyone in the mountains, drives a gas-guzzling truck.) \"Does climate change play a role in it? For sure, I think,\" Gibbs said of the pine-beetle epidemic. But, he added, \"I think scientists are still really studying it.\" DEEP IN THE FOREST John Mack has a saying: \"These trees are dead; they just don't know it.\" Along a back road to a campsite in Rocky Mountain National Park, the chief of resource stewardship at the park points out seemingly healthy trees covered in ugly, popcorn-shaped masses, a lodgepole pine's natural response to the mountain pine beetle. A healthy tree can forcefully push burrowing beetles out, but many of Colorado's pines are water-stressed and aging. Beetles have mass-attacked them, an onslaught that can overwhelm even healthy trees, Mack says. North America is witnessing the largest pine-beetle epidemic in recorded history. From Canada's Yukon Territory to New Mexico, pine trees by the hundreds of millions are succumbing to a fungus that the beetles carry. The pine needles of infected trees first turn a violent red, then they fall, and, finally, the dead tree topples over. Year by year, communities have watched a scourge advance across mountainsides and through neighborhoods, trees turning from green to red to gray. The beetles now attack 12 pine species, from the high-elevation whitebark pine to the lower-elevation ponderosa and pi\u00f1on. The blight has devastated 3.3 million acres in Colorado alone since the 1990s. Beetles kill, die off, and regenerate, all of which is part of a lodgepole pine forest's natural life cycle. But human activity helped set the stage for the current epidemic. Decades of fire suppression have left the West with dense stands of vulnerable, elderly trees. Climate has also played a role. Frigid winters that usually kill the beetles have become, over the past 20 years, the exception rather than the rule. Earlier snowmelt and longer summers have altered the beetles' range and life cycle; they now attack pines at higher altitudes and latitudes, and they reproduce twice a year instead of once. Earlier springs and a series of dry years have also weakened trees, turning them into ideal beetle food. Among the scientific community, a consensus is growing that changes in climate have propelled the outbreak. Jeff Mitton, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Colorado (Boulder), has been studying the mountain pine beetle for more than 30 years. There's no doubt in his mind that climate change has driven the infestation. \"The question is, why has this gotten so much worse?\" Mitton said, with the placid gaze of a man used to thinking about long stretches of evolutionary time. \"The beetles are out six weeks to two months earlier because springtime temperatures are warmer.\" Mitton connected the epidemic to other changes observed in American landscapes, from melting glaciers to shifting agricultural regions to increases in global temperatures. But the evidence that Mitton and his colleagues are piecing together has yet to persuade many people in the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service, let alone the average Coloradoan, that climate change has driven the pine-beetle epidemic. \"There's a lot of discussion\" about whether climate change influenced the epidemic, said Cal Wettstein, the Forest Service's incident commander who coordinates the regional response to the epidemic. \"Of course, I'm not an expert on it. It's possible that it might be a factor. It's not the driving factor.\" Mack says, \"There's no question that we're seeing changes in different aspects\" of ecological life at Rocky Mountain National Park. But he warned that the shifts aren't \"the dramatic effects that people tend to associate with climate change.\" Mack and Wettstein remain focused on dealing with an immediate consequence of the outbreak: keeping people and infrastructure safe from falling trees. Wettstein estimates that 100,000 dead trees will fall every day for the next 10 years in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. A falling tree could kill a hiker, take out a power line, or block a back road. It's tough to connect an ecological phenomenon to a single factor. It's also tough to predict the local manifestation of global warming in a mountainous state that sees a lot of weather variation. \"I think that what's uncertain are the details,\" said professor William Bowman, director of the lab that Mitton and others use for studies of ecology and climate change. \"What I see is not so much disagreement over whether climate change will occur; it's how it will be manifest.\" Coloradoans have noticed that species are shifting their ranges, snows are melting earlier, and--particularly this year--warm weather is coming mighty early. Set aside the polarized climate-change debate, and you'll find communities dealing with a set of conditions that aren't obviously linked to rising global temperature and that don't, on a day-to-day basis, constitute a catastrophe. They're not yet seeing evidence that could spur action on carbon emissions. But if the climate models are correct, the changes that Coloradoans are already experiencing herald a very challenging future for the West. The best way to view the effects of climate change in Colorado, it turns out, is from a car. Take Interstate 70 west from Denver toward Glenwood Springs, and you'll move from the Great Plains to high-altitude pine forest in an hour. As mountains unfurl and you drive into areas dense with lodgepole pines, the full visual impact of the epidemic asserts itself. New growth and untouched species amidst the devastation don't make the skeleton pines any less spooky. The steep descent into Dillon presents perhaps the most dramatic sight on the highway. Cars shoot through the Eisenhower Tunnel, bored straight through solid mountainside, and pop out into a valley where in some places 70 percent of the trees are dead. Residents of Summit County have been grappling with a changing forest for almost a decade, and that has meant wrestling with fear, confusion, misinformation, apathy, and a sense of helplessness. In some ways, their experience is a microcosm of the larger climate-change debate. A bum knee doesn't stop Howard Hallman, an earnest man kitted out in the Colorado uniform of fleece vest and sturdy boots, from clambering over the land that separates I-70 from Straight Creek. On one side of the stream, the mountainside is designated wilderness; on the other, it's designated roadless, making it almost impossible to drive tree-removal equipment in. A wildfire on either side could send dirt and debris tumbling into Dillon's only water source, but there's little residents can do--legally or logistically--to protect the creek. \"We have human habitat, we have housing, we have recreation, so we can't really let things run their course,\" Hallman said. Like a lot of Coloradoans, he worries that the dead trees heighten fire risk. Scientists dispute the extent to which beetle-kill trees affect fire behavior, but laypeople and experts alike are certain of one thing: In a dry year, the forest will burn. And this year looks to be extremely dry. Hallman's community group, the Forest Health Task Force, worked with the Forest Service to clear-cut a 60-acre patch near Straight Creek, hoping to mitigate the fire hazard. The patch of bare ground looks pathetically small measured against the surrounding mountains. From the brewpub where the task force meets each month, patrons can look out the window and see the Dillon Reservoir. The fact that the towns of Dillon, Frisco, and Silverthorne lie clustered around a reservoir that none of them can draw water from is a testament to the quirks of Western water appropriation. Constructed in the 1960s by Denver Water, the public utility for the state's capital, the Dillon Reservoir is Denver's property. Runoff from snows that blanket Summit County flows into the reservoir and then courses through the mountains for 70 miles to the sprawling metropolitan area on the plains. Summit County snowmelt that doesn't get siphoned off to local towns, Denver, or Colorado Springs eventually joins the Colorado River, the primary water source for close to 40 million people across the western United States. The Forest Health Task Force long ago concluded that the pine-beetle outbreak can't be stopped. The citizens, environmentalists, politicians, and fire-service and water-utility officials who make up the group spent part of their May meeting talking about the threat that falling trees pose to infrastructure. They spent most of their time talking about drought. \"What we have now is a very dry year. It could possibly be a very, very serious drought,\" said Steve Swanson, head of the nonprofit Blue River Watershed Group. In a voice so soft that listeners strained to hear him, Swanson laid out what was on everyone's mind. As of early April, Colorado's snowpack was 48 percent below average. Conditions haven't been this dry since 2002, the year made notorious by the Hayman fire, the largest in state history. That inferno burned more than 138,000 acres in the hills southwest of Denver and clogged the Cheesman Reservoir with an ashy slurry. The Western Forestry Leadership Coalition estimates that direct costs, rehabilitation, and other indirect costs of the fire topped $200 million. Ten years later, the rehabilitation effort is ongoing. Colorado's 30 largest forest fires on record have all occurred since 1996, and state data suggest that fires have been growing in size as well as frequency. As this story went to press, New Mexico was fighting the largest forest fire in its history, a 46,000-acre blaze was burning in northern Colorado, and an 8,000-acre fire was spreading in southwest Colorado, near Durango. At the meeting, Gibbs made a pitch for establishing \"defensible space\" around homes: a cleared area that stops fire from leaping from treetop to rooftop, or from bushes to front stoop. Defensible space is standard practice in Southern California, but it's not something Colorado policymakers and homeowners have thought much about until recently. In Summit County, people are adjusting to a new normal. Longtime environmental stressors such as the pine beetle, drought, and wildfire have become more prevalent. Even people who believe that those changes are linked to rising global temperatures have a sense that bringing up climate change only polarizes and confuses the discussion. Dan Schroder, director of the Colorado State University Extension in Summit County, heads a program that educates the community about fire risk and explains what's killing all the trees. But he'd rather not drag climate policy into it. \"I'm in the camp where climate change is happening, and it's something that we need to address and think about as we move forward,\" Schroder said. \"But in order to engage with the general public, that sort of remains somewhat inflammatory, or a bit of a conflicting idea. So I tend not to engage that term 'climate change.' \" Hallman came to Colorado in 1972 to work as an engineer at the molybdenum mine up in Climax. He has been working as an environmental consultant since the late 1980s, but he's not a climate-change expert. He's a guy who cares about the outdoors and who's hungry for information about the changes he's seeing around his home. He's also worried that a confusing, sustained debate over whether the Earth is warming and why can only mean political paralysis. \"We have people who are saying, well, it doesn't exist, and not only it doesn't exist, but if you believe it exists, you are somehow--you are at least a socialist, if not a communist,\" Hallman said. \"So that's not a good starting point.\" \"When it comes to allocating funding, like at the local level, if you have the misinformation ... how are you going to have the political will to take the actions that are necessary?\" he asked. Another task-force member, Breckenridge-based environmental consultant Brad Piehl, feels the same way. \"People need more facts. They need to sit down and talk about it,\" he said. Mitton and other scientists might argue that those facts are already present, but at the local level, there is still room for doubt. People are watching new growth sprout around the dead pine stands. They know they live in a dry state. And even those who believe that reducing carbon emissions is necessary, like Hallman and Piehl, know that unless a majority of Americans feel that the same way, the national action needed to start that reduction isn't going to happen. Locals can't do anything to stop the pine beetle's spread, just as they can't do anything, as individuals, to slow global carbon emissions. The way the pine-beetle outbreak will affect fire and water behavior remains murky, just as it's unclear how climate change will ultimately affect people's behavior about fire and water in the West. Advocates anticipate that more wildfires or water shortages could help convince people that climate change is here, and that it's a problem. But by the time scientists have proven the changes and everyone else has accepted them, more of us will already be living with the fallout. \"We're slowly, and maybe without even realizing it, adapting,\" said Lisa Dale, assistant director for parks, wildlife, and lands at the Colorado Natural Resources Department. The people in charge of managing the state's natural resources are dealing with climate factors even if they don't call their problem \"climate change,\" she said. One of Colorado's U.S. senators, Mark Udall, has for years pointed to the beetle epidemic as the kind of evidence that conclusively shows climate change is occurring in plain view. But his and other lawmakers' efforts to move the needle on climate policy have gone nowhere. \"To a large degree, our nation's parks are the canary in the coal mine when it comes to on-the-ground effects of a warming climate,\" Udall said at a 2009 hearing on climate change that the Democrat held at Rocky Mountain National Park with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. At the time, Udall pointed to \"trees killed by a bark-beetle epidemic that has been exacerbated by a warming climate.\" Three years later, Udall is still calling Colorado's forests \"canaries in the coal mine for the effects of a warming climate.\" In a statement released by his office last week, the senator said, \"We need to look into understanding the very real impacts that affect the health of our resources and our ability to protect them.\" Udall supported the Senate draft of a highly contentious bill to \"cap and trade\" carbon emissions. After a mad scramble for votes, the legislation barely based the House in the summer of 2009. It soon bogged down in the Senate--largely because of coal-state Democrats' fears that the legislation would damage their local economies and open them to political attack. Their fears were justified. Scores of House Democrats lost their seats when opponents and interest groups pounded them with their cap-and-trade vote, along with votes on health care reform and other Democratic priorities. Even some who had opposed cap-and-trade fell victim. \"Candidly, I think the Republicans--who were in the minority--saw the opportunity to use this bill to make inroads,\" said Rick Boucher, who represented a district in Virginia's coal country for 28 years before losing his seat in 2010. Attack ads hammered swing-district Democrats like him for their cap-and-trade votes, Boucher said. He was particularly vulnerable because he chose to try to help craft a bill that would strike a balance between regulating emissions and protecting industry back home--the very thing we expect responsible lawmakers to do. \"It was a factor in my race,\" Boucher said. Since the cap-and-trade bill faltered, Congress has shown little inclination to act. The Republican Party seems more dug in on the matter now than ever, with most GOP lawmakers publicly doubting evidence that human activity is warming the planet, opposing any regulation that would curb fossil-fuel use, or both. The party's standard-bearer, presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, openly distanced himself from the science of climate change in remarks to donors in Pittsburgh last fall. \"My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us,\" Romney said. Even Colorado Republicans in Congress, who see sickly forests on a regular basis, refuse to tie the beetle infestation and drought to human activity and resist the idea of regulating carbon emissions. In May 2012, GOP Rep. Scott Tipton held a field hearing on the bark beetle in Montrose, in the southwest part of the state. At the hearing, he blamed \"federal obstruction\" and mismanagement of Colorado's forests for the beetle epidemic and called for more timber extraction to thin aged pine stands. Federal mismanagement, Tipton maintains, is the primary driver of the beetle outbreak. He says that the climate has been changing throughout history and that there's still debate over the role human activity has played in current shifts. \"We've got to be responsible,\" the lawmaker said, when reached by phone at his office in Washington. \"We've got to be able to create jobs; we've got to be able to provide energy.\" Even if the United States and Europe both stopped emitting carbon for the next 25 years, the difference would soon be made up by other nations, Tipton said. Rep. Mike Coffman, another Colorado Republican, said: \"Climate change is naturally occurring. What influence do we have over that, we certainly need to look into, but that's subject to debate.\" Tipton and Coffman (and Romney, for that matter) have plenty of company. Fifty-two percent of Americans believe that the effects of global warming have already set in, according to a March Gallup Poll, down from a high of 61 percent in 2008. Forty-one percent believe that the climate is changing because of natural causes, compared with 53 percent who blame human activity. The number of people who say that human activities are the primary cause of global warming has dropped 8 percentage points since 2003. While the debate rages on, the climate of the Rockies continues to transform, with consequences that will reverberate nationwide. Stream flow in the Colorado River basin is expected to decrease over the next 50 years, purely as a result of precipitation and temperature changes, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The median projection anticipates a 9 percent decrease from the historical mean by 2060, said Carly Jerla, a co-manager for the Colorado River Basin water supply and demand study. \"There will be more extreme highs, more extreme lows,\" she said, \"all trending toward a lower, decreased overall mean.\" Over the same period, the bureau predicts that the human population dependent on the Colorado River for drinking water will rise from the current 40 million people to between 49.3 million and 76.5 million. Significant economic effects could follow. Experts warn that changes could disrupt a thicket of local and regional water-rights agreements and necessitate expensive infrastructure changes. Agriculture across the West could experience a major hit as growing conditions change and water supplies shift. In mountain towns, such as those in Summit County, the omnipresent recreation industry may have to cope with less-than-epic snowfall. Despite the alarming predictions, communities in Colorado and elsewhere don't yet feel that they're living the future that climate models predict. A full-throated call for action in Washington seems unlikely, no matter how often advocates try to provoke one. \"We have to have a two-pronged approach,\" said Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat whose district is primarily the city and county of Denver. \"If you just try to deal with the practical issues without the underlying cause, then over time, the situation on the ground is only going to worsen for our state. ... From a congressional standpoint, what we should be doing is trying to steer our public policy so we move away from fossil fuels.\" Right now, Colorado's congressional delegation is working to address the effects of the beetle outbreak--not the changing climate that's helping drive it. But Boucher said he believes that Congress, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, should again attempt to act to regulate carbon emissions, because EPA can't create a \"buffer against economic disruption\" like Congress can. The threat of EPA regulation-by-fiat could help build bipartisan consensus for action--if only there were consensus that the problem exists in the first place. For now, the political cost of action remains too high and the economic incentives for taking drastic measures too low. Until that dynamic shifts, supporters of climate-change policy will have to marshal their facts and continue to point to episodes such as the beetle infestation to try to convince those on the fence. Scientists worry that by the time evidence becomes undeniable and political will has amassed, it will be too late for reducing emissions to make any difference. Many worry that the tipping point for action has already passed. To cope with a changing climate, communities from Denver to Dhaka need to do two things. Adapt, step by step, to the new normal, and move, step by step, away from burning fossil fuels. Little incentive exists to make punishing changes to the economy while the evidence of climate change remains opaque to so many people. But by the time the evidence overwhelms us, millions of trees will be rotting on the ground.","headline":"As Politicians Debate Climate Change, Our Forests Wither","article_name":258549.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2012\/06\/as-politicians-debate-climate-change-our-forests-wither\/258549\/","date_published":"2012-06-15 15:40:00","article_length":24281,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:44.179596","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2012\/06\/as-politicians-debate-climate-change-our-forests-wither\/258549\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It will be a long time before we understand what the outbreak did to the global economy. So far, less than 0.0008 percent of the humans on Earth have been diagnosed with the disease caused by the coronavirus known as COVID-19. But thanks to the circulation of disease and capital, the whole world has been affected. Chinese manufacturing cities such as Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, are intimately entangled with the supply chains of the entire world. That means that both the disease and the containment measures enacted to control it (take, for example, the quarantine still in place for 70 million people ) will have a dramatic effect on businesses across disparate industries. Any company\u2014including Apple and Walmart \u2014that brings things in from China has to worry about production and distribution slowdowns. That\u2019s partly because supply chains are less linear than they sound. Production networks often have complex interrelationships that go back and forth across borders. An American retailer might contract with only one Chinese company, but that entity in turn might act like a general contractor, pulling in components from many sources or farming out work to a changing list of factories. In 2018, for instance, more than 1,000 facilities were involved in some way with the making of Apple products. Meanwhile, exporters\u2014such as Brazilian ranchers and Chilean winemakers \u2014are facing a massive drop in Chinese demand. Inside China, the economic decline is expanding beyond the manufacturing sectors; even a media company said it was laying off 500 workers because of the epidemic. Read: A historic quarantine What makes this all so strange is that a mosaic of facts is known about the economic consequences of the coronavirus, but the arrival of those consequences outside China will be delayed, and their magnitude is uncertain . It doesn\u2019t help that experts inside and outside China have questioned the reliability of the country\u2019s official statistics for years. And local reporting provides reasons to doubt coronavirus numbers as well. What Target executives are worried about today will actually show up for shoppers in April . You might think that financial markets, at least, would be \u201cpricing in\u201d the problems, but share prices are at record highs . The coronavirus has likely already dealt many of its economic blows\u2014and now those disruptions will trickle through the networks that connect China to the rest of the global economy. Some of the effects will be material: There might be fewer items on store shelves, some prices might rise, product development could slow down. But some of the impact, and an additional source of lag, will come from the data describing the reality of the past two months, much of which has yet to be tabulated. Companies and governments need statistics to understand what\u2019s happening in the world. The U.S. government, for example, maintains a complex data-gathering operation: the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the Bureau of Labor Statistics , certain survey programs of the Census , the National Agricultural Statistics Service , the Economic Research Service , and many others . The data that these organizations publish take time to reflect on-the-ground commerce. Under normal conditions, this may not be significant. But when the economy suffers a globe-altering shock, statistical windows on the world can be dangerously out of step with reality. For now, the data points that can be marshaled to make sense of the macroeconomic picture are not good. Chinese oil demand was down 20 percent earlier this month, \u201cprobably the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, and the most sudden since the Sept. 11 attacks,\u201d as Bloomberg put it . With some huge Chinese cities under varying versions of lockdown, the total number of cars and trucks on the road has fallen. Factories are not running at full capacity either. Pollution near Shanghai, a reliable and hard-to-fake indicator of economic activity, has plummeted, according to Morgan Stanley . Container ships are sailing with smaller than normal cargo loads . Prices for bulk carriers that move iron ore and coal have collapsed . One analyst told the Financial Times that the coronavirus \u201cwill have a bigger impact on the global tech supply chain than SARS and creates more uncertainty than the U.S.-China trade war.\u201d That very trade war led some companies to move their supply chains to other Asian countries , but China remains the beating heart of manufacturing and assembly for the world\u2019s goods. \u201cSuddenly, all supply chains seem vulnerable because so many Chinese supply chains within supply chains within supply chains rely on each other for parts and raw materials,\u201d Rosemary Coates, a supply-chain consultant, wrote in the trade journal Logistics Management . \u201cThat tiny valve that is inside a motor that you are sourcing for your U.S.-made product is made in China. So are the rare earth elements you require to manufacture magnets and electronics.\u201d The impacts may also vary widely from province to province and even factory to factory based on how local governments regulate their regions, CNBC\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, Eunice Yoon, noted . Read: How to misinform yourself about the coronavirus The slow industrial march out of China has also left some industries, like toy making, with depleted inventories . Companies that spent last year building new production networks in other Asian countries are more resilient in the long term, but at this particular moment, they may not have enough product to sell. Less predictable secondary effects have cropped up too. As Indonesia\u2019s president called for stimulus spending to guard against an economic slowdown, the price of Indonesian garlic went up 70 percent , apparently because Chinese consumers were buying up the folk cure in bulk. Even small ripples must have some effect: In Australia, where students from China could not return to class after the summer holiday, universities pushed back their start dates , which hurt the businesses around them . The question is whether all those small problems and complications will add up to anything more serious than annoyance. Then, consider the political ramifications of the economic slowdown. What if the coronavirus crisis slows China\u2019s economic growth enough to destabilize the Communist Party\u2019s control? Bill Bishop, a longtime China analyst, wrote that the outbreak is the closest thing \u201cto an existential crisis for Xi [Jinping] and the Party that I think we have seen since 1989.\u201d The coronavirus is a remarkable probe for the complex relationships that hold up today\u2019s economy. In our world, information flows much more quickly than goods. That means we can glimpse a major world event, in tweets and videos from the quarantine zone, weeks before its impact will be quantified. It is an uneasy and strange position, like knowing an earthquake has struck but not knowing whether a tsunami is on the way. One upshot for Americans is likely, though: Even if the worst of the outbreak is over\u2014and it might not be\u2014bad economic news may well be in our future. Or if tens of millions of Chinese workers can be sidelined, and the American economy can plow through it all without a hitch, then it might be time to revise how deep the \u201c Chimerica \u201d connection really is.","headline":"The Coronavirus Is a Data Time Bomb","article_name":606508.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2020\/02\/coronavirus-effects-on-global-markets-will-be-delayed\/606508\/","date_published":"2020-02-13 15:58:19","article_length":7352,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:44.811187","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2020\/02\/coronavirus-effects-on-global-markets-will-be-delayed\/606508\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The accepted wisdom in Washington holds that energy and the environment are fraught, partisan subjects on which there is little room for compromise. Time and again, Republicans question the existence of climate change, Democrats question the scientific literacy of Republicans\u2014and, inevitably, no progress is made. But, as Stephen Ansolabehere and David Konisky use survey data to argue in their compelling new book, Cheap and Clean: How Americans Think About Energy in the Age of Global Warming (MIT Press, 2014), the rest of the country looks at the environment in a somewhat different way. Namely, a more practical one. As the title suggests, the authors posit that, when it comes to energy and the environment, basic matters such as cost and cleanliness\u2014will the water be pure? will the air be clean?\u2014are voters' chief interests. On climate change, by contrast, Americans \"express concern about the problem in the abstract,\" the authors write, \"but neither is the risk of climate change high on our list of public priorities, nor is it a problem for which we are willing to pay more than a small amount.\" (Steve Moors)This suggests that pro-environment politicians hoping to pass climate-friendly policies may benefit from minimizing talk about global warming and instead focusing on immediate and localized health risks. Indeed, the White House is already using this messaging. In announcing new draft regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency in May, for instance, President Obama didn't emphasize the benefits to the global climate. Instead, he touted what have been termed \"ancillary benefits\"\u2014that the new rules would prevent 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks in just the first year they're implemented. This rhetoric echoes the strategy that worked for environmentalists during the 1970s, when the movement emphasized\u00a0 concrete goals like clean air and water. But the authors point out that this approach has succeeded more recently, too. They cite a case study from the 2010 election: California's Proposition 23, which threatened to scrap the state's landmark clean-energy legislation that had\u00a0 passed several years earlier. In 2010, California was still suffering the effects of a severe recession. During economic downturns, environmental issues\u2014particularly ones with a hefty price tag attached\u2014fare terribly with voters. And yet, by playing up the role of the unpopular oil companies and emphasizing the health risks associated with Prop 23, environmental advocates managed to prevail. \"Passing and successfully defending climate legislation turned not on the risks and costs of global warming to future generations,\" the authors explain, \"but on the immediate social costs associated with air and water pollution from the energy sector.\" Such salesmanship could prove a valuable weapon for environmentalists: The authors argue that \"the nation might even ignore the climate issue and make progress on the problem.\" To be sure, if Ansolabehere and Konisky's research offers practical advice for environmentalists, it contains downsides for them as well. Americans are, after all, concerned about the cost of energy. And when people are informed of the true costs of wind and solar power, they are less likely to be supportive. There are no simple answers here for environmental activists, or for politicians on either side of the aisle. Still, the finding that Americans are consistent about what they look for in energy provides an opening for policymakers. Rather than seeking to pass comprehensive climate legislation, the authors recommend emphasizing measures that aim to capture the social cost of carbon, which is to say, the costs in areas such as health and worker productivity. \"We pay these costs throughout our economy,\" the authors note, \"but they are not reflected in the price of energy.\" Perhaps if environmentalists focused less on climate change, they would be able to\u00a0 address this conundrum.","headline":"The Climate Change Trap","article_name":439347.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/the-climate-change-trap\/439347\/","date_published":"2014-09-12 05:00:21","article_length":3951,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:45.316948","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/the-climate-change-trap\/439347\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s a shame\u2014ours and his. In the first novel ever written about Sherlock Homes, we learn something peculiar about the London detective. Holmes, supposedly a modern man and a keen expert in the workings of the world, does not know how the solar system works. Specifically he is unfamiliar with the heliocentric Copernican model, which, upon its slow acceptance in the 17th century, revolutionized Western thought about the place of our species in the universe. \u201cWhat the deuce is it to me?\u201d Holmes asks his sputtering soon-to-be sidekick, Dr. Watson. \u201cYou say that we go \u2019round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\u201d Brains are a kind of \u201clittle empty attic,\u201d says the detective, and they should be filled only with furniture that\u2019s useful to one\u2019s line of work. Holmes doesn\u2019t doubt the Copernican model; he simply has no use for it in solving murder cases. \u201cNow that I do know it,\u201d he adds, \u201cI shall do my best to forget it.\u201d Thursday night, as record lows gripped most of the country\u2019s northern half, President Trump clarified that he does not understand another revolution in our knowledge of the natural order of things: the theory of human-driven climate change. In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year\u2019s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! Trump is wrong about the science\u2014I\u2019ll get to that in a moment\u2014but, first, let\u2019s not mince words: The president is trolling here. Pointing to cold weather and asking Whither climate change? is, by this point, almost a Republican tradition. In February 2015, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma brought a snowball inside the Senate chambers to demonstrate that global warming was not real. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,\u201d said Inhofe, then the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \u201cIn case we have forgotten because we keep hearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record.\u201d Despite the snowball, 2014 was the warmest year on record . It was followed by 2015, which broke 2014\u2019s record and became the new hottest year on record ; and 2016, which  became the new hottest year after it blasted away 2015\u2019s record. Though this year is not yet over, NASA estimates that 2017 will also beat 2015\u2019s record and become the second-hottest year ever recorded. And even if this late cold snap averts that dreadful streak, 2017 will still break 2014\u2019s record . We have just lived through what would be, in any other decade, the warmest year ever measured. Perhaps Trump has forgotten that his native New York suffered three heat waves by late July this year , or that a \u201cnormal\u201d summer now would count as a \u201chot\u201d summer during the 20th century . Scorching temperatures have vanished not because global warming has stopped, but because it is the winter, which every preschooler knows as the \u201ccold season.\u201d Six months after hurricane season ends, Floridians do not ask where the tropical cyclones have gone; cable-news pundits do not spend time every night debating whether the sun will rise the next morning, though that may be preferable to what is currently aired. And there is, in fact, a connection between global warming and the current frigid weather across the United States. Spend some time clicking around the Climate Reanalyzer \u2014a fantastic tool from the University of Maine\u2014and you\u2019ll see that the northern half of North America is the only part of the world where temperatures are significantly colder right now than normal. Moscow, Russia, is normally about 24 degrees Fahrenheit this time of year; it\u2019s currently pushing 40 . The Arctic as a whole is more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Nor is this phenomenon limited to exotic capitals. Los Angeles has an average high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit on December 29. Today it hit 82 . It\u2019s not too much of an exaggeration to say it\u2019s warmer than normal almost everywhere right now except for Canada and the northern United States. What no one should tell the president is that this pattern may not be due to random chance\u2014it seems to arise from global climate change. For the past decade or so, climate scientists have noticed that when the Arctic has an especially warm winter, the northern continents become especially cold and snowy . A plethora of studies in the past three years have seemed to confirm the connection: When the Arctic is extremely warm, it seems to loose cold air across the world, and northern North America suffers an extremely cold winter . Why? Scientists aren\u2019t sure yet, but they think it may arise from a destabilized jet stream or a weakened stratospheric polar vortex . Just this past July, a team of researchers found that frigid winters, driven by a warm Arctic, were already reducing the productivity of American agriculture . They estimated that this warming has already cost Texas a 20 percent decline in corn production for some years. Suffice it to say: There is plenty of evidence that climate change is still at work, even in a week as chilling as this one. But does the president really need to understand all this stuff? Perhaps if he had remained in real-estate development, he could have stayed cheerfully ignorant. His line of work would never have touched the theory of human-driven climate change\u2014 outside of the occasional application for government money to protect a golf course from sea-level rise . But unfortunately for Americans\u2014and quite unlike the good detective of 221B Baker Street\u2014Trump\u2019s job has brought him frequently and directly into contact with climate science. During his year in office, he has made decision after decision that turns on a nuanced understanding of global warming. He has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. He has revoked a slew of Obama-era policies meant to stem greenhouse-gas emissions. He has repealed the Clean Power Plan , a landmark rule that would have made the United States grid less reliant on coal. And he has declined to seek any kind of climate-protecting measure in the new GOP tax bill , despite the many alumni of the Reagan administration pleading for it. People of good faith can disagree about the legality, effectiveness, and wisdom of any of these individual policies\u2014and they do. But Trump has attacked the policies collectively and with great gusto, while declining to ever actually learn about the underlying scientific evidence. Meanwhile, he sits atop the science agencies of the U.S. government, some of the finest scientific institutions ever constructed. Last month, his own administration released the Climate Science Special Report , a product of 13 federal agencies and itself the best scientific synopsis of climate change in years. It seemed to address exactly his concern. \u201cThe number of high temperature records set in the past two decades far exceeds the number of low temperature records,\u201d its authors said, with the highest confidence possible. \u201cThe frequency of cold waves has decreased since the early 1900s, and the frequency of heat waves has increased since the mid-1960s.\u201d (The Dust Bowl period still holds the record for the most extreme temperatures.) Trump has never expressed curiosity for this kind of fact finding or self-education. But neither he nor his administration has publicly fought climate change on its scientific basis. After some hand wringing this summer, the government released the unabridged Climate Science Special Report last month. And while much could still change, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of Trump\u2019s EPA, seems unlikely to revoke the agency\u2019s own endangerment finding , a 2009 memo that accepts the scientific foundations of climate change into federal policy. The Trump administration has hastily scaled back climate policy and barely touched climate science. Indeed, this has characterized Trump\u2019s approach: a rapid dismantling of law, and a lazy disregard for evidence. He has called climate change\u2014in part a triumph of the American scientific enterprise\u2014 a \u201choax\u201d \u201ccreated by and for the Chinese.\u201d Trump seems confident in his belief that Earth scientists and the climate-concerned have invented a phenomenon out of whole cloth and that he needs to pay little attention to it. He seems sure, too, that the shambolic catastrophe of a destabilized climate\u2014which will be a central preoccupation of the United States in the 21st century, whether its leaders recognize the reality of it or not\u2014is a fable. In so doing, he underestimates the citizens whom he governs; and he conceives of the country over which he presides as being shallower, less curious, quicker to anger, more unwise, and altogether not as secure in its good understanding than it actually is. Pity him, and mourn for us.","headline":"The President Doesn't Care to Understand Global Warming","article_name":549377.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/the-president-doesnt-care-to-understand-global-warming\/549377\/","date_published":"2017-12-29 17:17:15","article_length":8850,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:46.321615","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/the-president-doesnt-care-to-understand-global-warming\/549377\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The Court\u2019s decision to make oral arguments more accessible and transparent is unprecedented\u2014and should be the norm even after the pandemic. Like so many parents who have been sheltering in place with their children, I have been conscripted into the role of homeschool teacher\u2014or, more particularly, I am a teacher\u2019s aide, charged with shepherding my elementary-school student through remotely assigned tasks. In this role, I have been reminded that simply arriving at an answer\u2014even the right answer\u2014is not enough. To get full credit, the student must \u201cshow her work,\u201d carefully laying out the steps by which she arrived at the answer. On Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it would show its work on a wider scale, hearing oral arguments via telephone and providing media outlets with a live-stream of the proceedings. This unprecedented move offers the prospect of greater transparency from a Court whose work has been uniquely\u2014and stubbornly\u2014sequestered from public view. Polly J. Price: How a fragmented country fights a pandemic Normally, members of the public are allowed to attend oral arguments, but access is limited, and often requires waiting in line overnight, particularly for the most controversial cases. Because the Court refuses to televise its proceedings, the rest of the world must make do with audio recordings of oral arguments, which, along with argument transcripts, are released days later. Justices\u2019 conferences, where they discuss their views on cases, are conducted privately (and that is not changing). Only when decisions are announced do the majority of Americans get any sense of the Court\u2019s thinking. The move to live-streamed oral arguments will, for the first time, offer all Americans real-time admission to the nation\u2019s highest court, sating the interest of longtime Court watchers while also attracting new audiences. The Court\u2019s shift to telephonic oral arguments shows how substantially pandemic conditions have forced institutions to make accommodations in order to function in our new reality. In-person meetings are now conducted via videoconferencing; the messaging platform Slack enables team members to communicate with one another while working remotely. Going back to the old ways will be difficult. At least as far as the Court is concerned, we shouldn\u2019t go back. The Court\u2019s switch to live-streamed oral arguments is an important and welcome concession to the current climate, but it is a move that should have happened well before a global pandemic demanded it. Even before the coronavirus, congressional proceedings were aired over C-SPAN, and the president, governors, and other government officials routinely appear on various news programs. Of the three branches of government, the Court is perhaps the least transparent, remaining doggedly shrouded from public view. Why should this be the case? As much as Congress or the president, the Court serves an important function in our democracy. Indeed, the cases now slated for telephonic conferences concern a variety of issues of great public significance, including the scope of exemptions to the terms of the Affordable Care Act, and whether federal and state officials may subpoena the president\u2019s financial records. The Court\u2019s work shapes Americans\u2019 lives in ways both profound and mundane. Yet most Americans are given relatively few opportunities to see or hear the Court at work. Garrett Epps: The Supreme Court has chosen reckless partisanship We are all adapting to pandemic conditions. When this crisis passes, we will sort through the rubble, deciding which pandemic-era practices to maintain, and which to abandon in favor of the old, familiar ways. The Court\u2019s new transparency is a necessary accommodation of a global catastrophe, but public understanding and appreciation of the Court\u2019s work are also necessary preconditions for bolstering and maintaining a healthy and thriving democracy. Given the opportunity to show its work to the American people, the Court cannot\u2014and should not\u2014go back.","headline":"The Supreme Court Should Never Go Back to Its Pre-coronavirus Ways","article_name":609991.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/04\/supreme-court-should-never-go-back-its-pre-coronavirus-ways\/609991\/","date_published":"2020-04-15 10:00:00","article_length":4019,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:46.410803","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/04\/supreme-court-should-never-go-back-its-pre-coronavirus-ways\/609991\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s not enough to let the market handle it or depend on geo-engineering. A&Q is a special series that inverts the classic Q&A , taking some of the most frequently posed solutions to pressing matters of policy and exploring their complexity. There is one convenient thing about climate change: The problem of global warming poses so many threats, and emerges from so many causes, that there\u2019s not one single solution for it. This is convenient because it means you can work on a lot of different angles and still help the underlying problem. If every American stopped eating meat tomorrow , the situation would immediately begin to improve but it wouldn\u2019t be solved; ditto if every coal plant worldwide was shut down tomorrow. Even in that crazy-go-nuts mitigation scenario, we\u2019d immediately be a lot better off, but there would still be work to do. So thinking about climate change requires a two-mindedness among those who want to pitch in to work against it\u2014or who just want to be educated voters on their city, country, or planet. On the one hand, we have reached the point where climate change will arrive regardless of what we do. Climate change is vast, hopeless, horrifying, anxiety-inducing, and imagination-staggering. On the other, it\u2019s a challenge without parallel in human history: a vast, fascinating, thrilling, inspiring, mind-bending opportunity. Many revere the Enlightenment thinkers for turning the high ideals of equality and justice into concrete political institutions (even as they and their contemporaries invented race and justified chattel slavery). But if converting ideals into institutions is an admirable challenge, don\u2019t worry: Now we have to do it too. On a global scale. Inventing as we go. No biggie. How big is the problem? Here is the basic climate-change mechanism: Cars, trucks, planes, power plants, factories, and farming techniques release certain gases into the atmosphere; these gases build up over time and trap more heat than other kinds of gases would; this extra warmth forces the climate\u2014the sum of weather everywhere\u2014to change, making it more energetic (since heat is just energy) and wily and destructive. Now, some scientists disagree over how bad climate change has already gotten , and some claim that pre-2100 global warming will be much worse than predicated , but neither of those disagreements are about the general principle\u2014and the general principle is what matters when it comes to addressing climate change with policy. So that\u2019s the problem. How might we solve it? That first part is unmistakably true: We are living the first hopeful years for climate change in memory. But maybe the Paris Agreement only seems optimistic when it\u2019s compared to the recent past, when the world\u2014and especially the United States\u2014did almost nothing to stop the warming atmosphere. Examine the details of this recent progress and it still looks pretty paltry. The Paris Agreement talks an ambitious game, but it has no mechanism to force anyone to do anything. And given the fragility of the domestic politics here in America, where the EPA\u2019s signature climate-change regulation was just stopped , what\u2019s to keep the United States from reneging on its larger Paris promise? And if the United States backs out, won\u2019t China and India follow ? Sure, but there\u2019s no rule preventing clean power and dirty fossil fuels from co-existing. Check the situation in Texas, where wind generated more than 10 percent of the energy mix last year\u2014but coal constituted 36 percent . And even when the news on climate seems wholly good, it somewhat relies on White House-supported policies. For instance, lots of Americans are building rooftop solar panels on their houses with the help of the recently extended federal solar-tax credit . Yet Nevada once had a friendly solar policy too\u2014until earlier this year, when it reversed them and literally made solar taxes retroactive . Will future administrations help bring clean energy into the world as much as the current one has? Some of the cost reductions in solar and wind power have come from government-research funding , after all. If the United States stops implementing its climate policies, will the cost of solar and wind creep up again? Some ( but not all ) environmentalists are beginning to argue a line like this. It\u2019s a line with little partisan shading, at least here in the U.S.: Neither Democrats nor Republicans support contracting the economy. It\u2019s also a view with many advocates but without a consistent policy. You can find de-growthism in many forms: Naomi Klein advocates for a kind of global socialism, while others imply that drastic, short-term cuts are the only way will curtail carbon emissions fast enough. In today\u2019s populist political climate, are such cuts possible\u2014even on the multi-decade level? Will Americans be able to live with the consequences of such cuts, much less accept or sustain them? Even anti-growth advocates are honest about their fall-out: \u201cNot only will our standards of living almost certainly drop, but it\u2019s likely that the very quality of our society\u2014equality, safety, and trust\u2014will decline, too,\u201d writes Daniel Immerwahr , in an article calling for the abandonment of growth. In a country with both entrenched, institutional racism and a nuclear-armed military, who will suffer most from that decline? As Republicans try to criticize climate regulation while accepting climate science, they turn to some variant of this line. I think there are two knocks against it\u2014one more facile than the other. The first is that, you know, if private industry was going to step up and address the climate crisis, it maybe should have done it already.  Greenland\u2019s ice sheet is sliding toward the sea , and Miami Beach is a lost cause : Where is the market? But worse, I think, is that this is more or less the tack that governments have chosen to take. Governments have incentivized some pathways to green energy more than others, but the world\u2019s approach is to move some assets around\u2014to send that \u201ccritical message to the global marketplace\u201d\u2014and then tell business to figure the rest out. Is that process working fast enough? Should the residents of small Pacific islands, vulnerable to sea-level rise, be satisfied with the progress of the markets? Would the market move faster if it didn\u2019t get these signals? The evidence so far, by the way, seems to prove the opposite. When the Obama administration set new fuel-efficiency standards for cars in 2012, manufacturers welcomed the move . A single, shared standard let all companies compete on the same framework and gave them investment targets to plan on. Would they have made the same improvements\u2014which have resulted in greenhouse-gas savings equal to the Clean Power Plan \u2014if they weren\u2019t pressed? Let\u2019s look at sulfates first: They\u2019re chemicals that would depress global temperatures for about 10 years and, in the meantime, reflect enough sunlight away to stave off some warming. Who should get to decide it\u2019s time to release them? How should we geo-engineer the planet in ways that are democratic? Which percentage of countries should get to decide how weather in all countries works? What if some countries declare that they can never support such a technology? Oliver Morton, an Economist editor who wrote a book on geo-engineering, has told The Atlantic that he worries far more about politics than the techniques themselves : What I really worry about with geoengineering is that conflict over its use will lead to a greater conflict that leads to a nuclear war [\u2026] because we don't even know if anyone's going to try geoengineering, but we know the wherewithal to have a nuclear war is out there in the world already. And what about carbon-scrubbing the troposphere? In some ways, it\u2019s easier than sulfate deployment, as more countries and companies might get behind returning the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels. But the most promising method\u2014 carbon capture and storage \u2014isn\u2019t ready for industrial deployment yet. How much should we risk the health of the planet for an unproven commercial technique? Indeed, an Oxford University study found that the most efficient way to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the next 50 years isn\u2019t some fancy technology. It\u2019s trees. This is only a tour of some of the solutions to climate change floating around. None is both adequate and likely. So maybe it\u2019s better to think in terms of management: How can the crisis be slowed, halted, and reversed as soon as possible? And how can you use your time and attention to help humanity along that path? What\u2019s the role of individuals in fighting climate change? Should they change their own routines to reduce their emissions, cutting red meat and dairy\u2014 however small those consequent savings may be \u2014or is that kind of activism meaningless compared to political involvement ? \u201cGrowth\u201d is now a mandate for American politicians, even as the country\u2019s natural rate of growth seems to be slowing. But is the improvement of quality-of-life for most people best measured through gross domestic product? As the climate warms, should we find aims other than constant growth in order to sustain a healthy society and livable planet? What kind of society and democratic government will be best positioned to handle resource scarcity and the sequential emergencies associated with the now-inevitable consequences of climate change? How can we bring about that society? What kind of global governance will be needed? And most important of all: Can the world both manage climate change and avoid its worst cataclysms, like hideous famines, mass migrations, surveillance-powered authoritarians, and World War III? Maybe there\u2019s an answer we haven\u2019t considered yet. Drop your thoughts into an email to hello@theatlantic.com .","headline":"What's the Answer to Climate Change?

He's been called \" America's fiercest climate blogger .\" And as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a former Clinton administration official on clean energy, and an MIT-trained physicist, the subjects he covers are vast -- ranging from energy policy to the role of rhetoric in communications, as discussed in his new book Language Intelligence . But there's been a recurrent theme over the years at Joe Romm's popular blog Climate Progress -- the argument that political leaders, and perhaps most prominently President Obama, need to step up and explain to the public why global warming is such a dramatic threat to our livelihoods and future. Indeed, Romm has called Obama's failure to speak out about global warming, loudly and often, his \" biggest communications mistake .\" Now, a raft of new polls are showing that this issue has the potential to move independent and swing voters -- the subject of the first Climate Desk Live Capitol Hill briefing on October 10 . So we stopped to chat with Romm, who will present at the briefing, about his unusual take on this subject. Climate Desk: You've been writing for a long time about how climate is a winning political issue. So what first got you onto this? Joe Romm: Well, I didn't pursue this topic because I thought it was a political winner. I started when my brother lost his home in Katrina, he wanted to know if he should rebuild, so I talked to a lot of climate scientists. And then I realized, \"this is more dire than I thought, and climate scientists are not doing a good job of communicating it.\" So it was the underlying reality that gave me an urgency to stop doing what I was doing -- clean energy consulting -- and start doing communications full time. That said, there are ways to talk about it that aren't useful, and I think people have mistaken the blowback from bad communications for thinking there's no way to communicate on this issue. And I think that's just not right. Do you think this has always been true -- that climate change has always been a potential political winner -- or has it become more true over time? I think many climate scientists have gotten better at communications because of Climategate. I think many of them thought they were like medical scientists -- you make your pronouncement, and then the patient does what he's told to do. And they realized that that's not how the political system works. You have to understand how to be an effective communicator. Since I had talked to all of these climate scientists and read the literature, I knew that climate change was coming faster than a lot of people thought. I knew it was going to be coming at this accelerated rate. So things are changing in real time, and now we've reached the point where the signal is distinguished from the noise. It was always the case that extreme weather was going to be the way that most people were going to experience climate change directly -- that seemed clear to me from all my research. Extreme weather is very random, but it is on top of a climate signal that continues to grow. So over time, you get more and more extreme events that are way above the natural variation. And so yes, I think we are now seeing events that are once in a thousand year events, like the Russian heat wave. I mean, Binghamton, New York had a one in one hundred year rain event in two consecutive years! And so that's led people like Jeff Masters to say, this is not the atmosphere I grew up with. If all of this is true, then where is the blockage between all the polling data on the one hand, and the behavior of political candidates on the other? There's no question that the Obama team has gotten a misimpression that this is not a winning issue. And that I think is based on some rather questionable analysis done years ago, that basically said, \"if you only present the doom and gloom case, you turn some people off.\" But nobody really does that -- nobody I know does that. Do we see any candidates who get the message and are campaigning on climate? I just published an article which showed that at least some Senate candidates, including Angus King, Elizabeth Warren, and Bob Kerrey, have raised this as an issue. And after the 2010 election, I noted there were only two Senate campaigns in which it became an issue. And in both of those, the anti-science candidate got blowback -- Carly Fiorina in California and Ken Buck in Colorado. And they lost. The polling data seems clear: This is a classic wedge issue that separates conservatives not just from progressives, but also from moderates and independents. So you know, we can spend a lot of time being puzzled about why this administration does bizarre messaging. If you talk to communications experts, many will say this administration is not great at it. You can get upset about President Obama not bringing up climate change, but this is not an administration that's good at communicating -- and this is just one of the many areas that they mistakenly downplay. As someone who does study communication closely, how would you recommend politicians talk about this issue? It depends on the audience, certainly. As someone who studies communication, I know that the most important thing is knowing who your audience is. And people who read my blog are not the general public. But, I've always believed that you should stick as closely to the science as possible. And my biggest advice to reporters has been, if you're doing a climate story, talk to climate scientists. The best climate stories are done by the people who talk to climate scientists. But I think this notion that you shouldn't talk about the science, or how dire things might be if we don't' act, that's silly. And on moral grounds, I think that if you believe a certain outcome is a very possible outcome, you have an obligation to tell people that. With global warming, the probability of a bad outcome if we stay on our current emission trends is incredibly high. If you know a bad outcome is likely to happen, what right do you have not to communicate that? You go into a doctor's office, what are they going to do -- not tell you the diagnosis?","headline":"Why Aren't Politicians Listening to Joe Romm About Climate Change?","article_name":263432.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/10\/why-arent-politicians-listening-to-joe-romm-about-climate-change\/263432\/","date_published":"2012-10-10 14:42:30","article_length":6299,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:48.514681","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/10\/why-arent-politicians-listening-to-joe-romm-about-climate-change\/263432\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Between now and 2050, forests are one of our \"most promising\" geo-engineering tools. When people talk about technologies that might offset climate change, they often evoke not-yet-invented marvels, like planes spraying chemicals into the atmosphere or enormous skyscrapers gulping carbon dioxide from the clouds. But in a new report , Oxford University researchers say that our best hopes might not be so complex. In fact, they are two things we already know how to do: plant trees and improve the soil. Both techniques, said the report, are \u201cno regrets.\u201d They\u2019ll help the atmosphere no matter what, they\u2019re comparatively low-cost, and they carry little additional risk. Specifically, the two techniques it recommends are afforestation \u2014planting trees where there were none before\u2014and biochar\u2014 improving the soil by burying a layer of dense charcoal. Between now and 2050, trees and charcoal are the \u201cmost promising\u201d technologies out there, it said. It also cautioned, however, that these so-called \u201cNegative Emissions Technologies\u201d or NETs should only be seen as a way to stave off the worst of climate change. \u201cNETs should not be seen as a deus ex machina that will \u2018save the day,\u2019\u201d its authors wrote. NETs should instead be seen as one of several tools to meet the international goal of avoiding climate change greater than 2 degrees Celsius . Another crucial tool is reducing emissions. It\u2019s a solution that makes sense, as forest management is one of the oldest ways that humans have shaped their environment. Before the arrival of Europeans, Native communities in the Americas had been burning forest fires for millennia to support the growth of desirable plants like blueberries and to manage ecosystems. British communities have long practiced coppicing , a tree-cutting technique that keeps forests full of younger trees. In other words, humanity has been \u201cgeoengineering\u201d with trees for a very long time. The authors of the Oxford report add that afforestation will need global support in order to be successful. \u201cIt is clear that attaining negative emissions is in no sense an easier option than reducing current emissions,\u201d it says (emphasis mine). \u201cTo remove CO2 on a comparable scale to the rate it is being emitted inevitably requires effort and infrastructure on a comparable scale to global energy or agricultural systems.\u201d","headline":"The Best Technology for Fighting Climate Change Is Right Outside Your Door","article_name":385304.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/02\/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-trees\/385304\/","date_published":"2015-02-09 17:30:37","article_length":2340,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:49.192360","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/02\/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-trees\/385304\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Democrats in the Senate passed a bill that would, for the first time ever, use Congress\u2019s power to push the U.S. to decarbonize. Updated at 5:19 p.m. on August 7, 2022  Climate change was born as a modern political issue in the United States Senate. On a hot June day in 1988, a senior NASA scientist warned a Senate committee that global warming, which was previously mooted only as a hypothesis, was not only real but already under way. \u201cIt is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here,\u201d James Hansen said. An auspicious start, and an ironic one. Since then, the fight against climate change in the United States and abroad has been defined by one constant: You can\u2019t get the Senate to do anything. For 34 years, the upper chamber\u2019s peculiar failure to act on the issue has shaped nearly every facet of policy and politics. Because the Senate could not pass a comprehensive climate bill, Congress could not; because Congress could not pass a climate bill, climate-concerned presidents had to rely on executive action and the permissiveness of the Supreme Court, and climate activists had to win smaller state and local reforms. This uniquely American reliance on regulatory, state, and local climate policy has never quite worked\u2014the country still lacks a comprehensive plan to decarbonize its electricity sector, for instance, which remains dirtier than Western Europe\u2019s\u2014and it has been too disjointed to help the United States transition away from fossil fuels. Even the edifice of international climate diplomacy was built with the Senate in mind. In 2015, diplomats wrote the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to be strictly voluntary for rich countries, so that the Senate would not have to ratify it. (In the final moments, the American delegation had to change an errant shall into a should to save it from Senate jurisdiction.) Madeleine Albright once said that America was \u201cthe indispensable nation.\u201d But on climate change, the Senate has been the invincible obstacle. But now, on a broiling August day 34 years after Hansen spoke, that record began to change. After an all-night session that stretched from Saturday evening into Sunday afternoon, Democrats voted along party lines to pass the first comprehensive climate law in American history. The bill will touch every sector of the economy, subsidizing massive new investments in renewable and geothermal energy, as well as nuclear power and carbon capture and removal, and encouraging new clean-energy manufacturing industries to develop in the United States. It is the first economy-wide emissions-reduction bill adopted by the Senate. At more than $369 billion, its investment in climate change is the largest in the country\u2019s history. As the bill neared a final vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York declared that it would \u201cendure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century.\u201d \u201cTo the tens of millions of young Americans who have spent years marching, rallying, demanding that Congress act on climate change, this bill is for you,\u201d he said. The bill will reduce U.S. emissions to about 40 percent below their all-time high, according to several studies from independent analysts . That will get the country about two-thirds of the way to accomplishing President Joe Biden\u2019s goal of cutting emissions 50 percent below their all-time high by 2030, Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton engineering professor and the author of an emissions model, told me. It does this by subsidizing zero-carbon electricity production, encouraging the transition to electric vehicles, and nudging industrial firms to adopt low-carbon manufacturing techniques, and despite a new provision that the government must lease some public lands for oil-and-gas drilling whenever it offers them for renewable construction. \u201cWe have never seen the Senate pass a major climate bill. It felt nearly impossible for decades\u2014it felt nearly impossible for the last month,\u201d Leah Stokes, a political-science professor at UC Santa Barbara, told me. It is something of a shock that a final bill emerged at all. Democrats spent much of last year negotiating a large spending bill that would accomplish many of their domestic priorities, not only on climate change and taxes but also on child poverty, free community college, and home care for senior citizens. That process fell apart in December when Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the caucus\u2019s two most moderate members, pulled out entirely. Negotiations restarted in the winter over a slimmed-down package, then broke down again a month ago when Manchin declared that he was too concerned about inflation to proceed. Only a last-minute, Hail Mary negotiating effort from Manchin and Schumer salvaged the package. Manchin only endorsed this bill, rechristened the Inflation Reduction Act, in exchange for Schumer\u2019s promise that Congress will, later this year, revisit rules governing where energy facilities are located. The bill passed today reflects Manchin\u2019s particular concerns for the future of the fossil-fuel industry, and in particular West Virginia\u2019s gas companies. \u201cThe fact that Schumer pulled a rabbit out of a hat here and put together a very good climate package\u2014even with a few warts\u2014is unbelievable,\u201d Stokes said. After all, the Senate has been failing on climate for Stokes\u2019s entire career\u2014really, for most of her (and my) life. The two highest-profile failures came on bills very much like this one, landmark energy legislation considered early in a Democratic president\u2019s first term. In 1992, President Bill Clinton proposed what became known as the \u201cBTU tax,\u201d a surcharge on energy production that would have reduced American emissions and functioned something like a carbon tax. (But not exactly like a carbon tax: The BTU tax would have levied a fee on nuclear energy, which a carbon tax does not do.) The House of Representatives passed the proposal, but the Senate never took it up. Eighteen years later, President Barack Obama endorsed a sweeping piece of climate legislation that would have created a new artificial market where companies could buy and sell the right to emit carbon. The House passed the measure. The Senate left it to die. But these were not the Senate\u2019s only climate-related failures, Matto Mildenberger, a political scientist and the author of Carbon Captured , a history of American climate inaction, told me. In 1997, the Senate voted 95\u20130 to forbid the United States from joining the Kyoto Protocol, the first attempt at an international climate treaty. In 2001, President George W. Bush took office with a new promise to regulate four air pollutants, including carbon dioxide. \u201cEven the Bush transition documents said that they were going to do it,\u201d Mildenberger said. The plan perished in part because of strong opposition from conservative Republican senators. A few years later, Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman introduced a bill to create a new market for trading carbon emissions\u2014arguably the most aggressive bipartisan climate bill ever proposed in Congress. It went nowhere. Neither did the Lieberman proposal co-written with Senator Mark Warner in 2007. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is, it\u2019s more clear to just about everybody that this is a huge problem; this is a huge challenge,\u201d Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who was one of the primary authors of the Obama-era bill, told me. \u201cTwo weeks ago, the temperature in London was 105 degrees. The Tour de France, they couldn\u2019t run parts of the race because the pavement was melting. We have wildfires here.  \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s different is, we have strong leadership in the White House, and I give them a lot of credit.\u201d The Inflation Reduction Act will now proceed to the House, where it must receive nearly every Democratic vote in order to pass. It will face two potential obstacles: On the caucus\u2019s right, a set of members, led by Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, has insisted that it cannot accept a bill that does not increase the tax break given for paying state and local taxes; on the left, a set of members may conclude that the bill does not go far enough on climate change. Neither of these groups, however, is likely to present quite the problem that the Senate did: Gottheimer\u2019s once-large set has already been whittled down to a few members, and left-wing House members are likely to follow Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s lead in criticizing the bill for not going far enough while still voting yes on it. The bill\u2019s passage in the Senate is the most significant climate news since China announced two years ago that it would aim to achieve net zero by 2060, perhaps even since the adoption of the Paris Agreement five years earlier. The structure of international climate politics is on the verge of changing: For the first time ever, America\u2019s Article I Congress, with its unique power to tax and spend and remake the shape of the economy, is going to push the U.S. economy to decarbonize. Many fights remain for climate advocates, and state and local laws, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, must continue to work at decreasing the country\u2019s emissions. (Indeed, Biden can meet his 2030 target only with continued state, local, and executive action.) But never again will climate action have to rely solely on executive action, and on the sort of administrative kludges that the country has previously depended on. It\u2019s fitting that the Senate passage of the bill happened within days of Australia\u2019s Parliament passing its own climate bill. Australia and the United States\u2014two Anglophone ex-colonies with sizable extraction industries\u2014have epitomized the world\u2019s struggle to take on climate change. (Australia even passed a carbon tax, then repealed it.) By the end of the year, the richest democracies in the world could all have a legislative climate policy for the first time.  As the final votes went through, the floor erupted into applause. (Most Republicans had already left the room.) Democrats exchanged celebratory hugs and backslaps, and a few senators teared up. \u201cThis is a planetary emergency, and this is the first time that the federal government has taken action that is worthy of the moment,\u201d Senator Brian Schatz, the Hawaii Democrat who started an initiative in 2019 to coordinate the party\u2019s climate policy, told me. \u201cNow I can look my kids in the eyes,\u201d he said, choking up, \u201cand say we\u2019re really doing something about climate.\u201d","headline":"History\u2019s Greatest Obstacle to Climate Progress Has Finally Fallen","article_name":671073.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/08\/senate-climate-inflation-reduction-bill-passed\/671073\/","date_published":"2022-08-07 19:35:56","article_length":10480,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:50.644669","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/08\/senate-climate-inflation-reduction-bill-passed\/671073\/","source":"atlantic"}

On Thursday, it released the latest version. We've extracted the four most important graphs. About twice a year, Yale University's Project on Climate Change Communication releases a survey assessing how Americans feel about the environmental threat. Today, it released the latest version. We've extracted the four most important graphs. Yale's summary of the data borders on the triumphant. \"Nearly two in three Americans (63%) believe global warming is happening,\" they write. \"Relatively few \u2013 only 16 percent \u2013 believe it is not\" \u2014\u00a0though the number has dropped, \"likely influenced by the relatively cold winter of 2012-13.\" And: \"Those who believe global warming is happening are more certain of their convictions than those who do not.\" And so on. More Americans think scientists agree global warming is happening. Half of Americans say they're worried about climate change. In all, positive-sounding news for those who are advocating for political action. The project offers past trends on its data, too. Here, for example, is the graph of Americans' \"belief\" in the effect, over time. You can see that 63 percent support, and those the-winter-was-too-cold people that caused that dip. But what's interesting here isn't really the figures. What's interesting is the trend. We shipped the data over to Excel to do simple trend lines for a number of the most important data points: belief in the fact of climate change, understanding of the cause, how important people considered the issue, and how worried they were about it. We've left out the individual data points here, because the point that's worth making doesn't require them. (And if you're interested, they're in the report .) Is climate change happening?  Blue is yes; red, no. What is the cause of climate change?  Blue, humans; red, natural; green, a combination. How important to you is climate change?  Blue is a combination of \"extremely\" and \"very;\" red, a combination of \"not very\" and \"not at all.\" How worried are you about climate change?  Blue is a combination of \"very\" and \"somewhat;\" red, a combination of \"not very\" and \"not at all.\" Again, these are very simple trend lines. But that doesn't really matter. In January of 2010, 57 percent of Americans said climate change was happening; since, we've gone up and down and landed at 63. In January 2010, 20 percent of people said the issue was \"very\" or \"extremely\" important; now, that's 21. And in several instances, the trends are getting worse. In order to get Washington to take political action, environmentalists need to demonstrate urgency. Not there-was-a-massive-storm-that-knocked-out-power-in-Lower-Manhattan-for-a-week urgency, but voters-care urgency. Even more of the former doesn't seem to be resulting in any more of the latter.

{"id":null,"body":"It calls on world governments to work together to fight climate change. An Italian magazine has leaked a draft of Pope Francis's anticipated encyclical on climate change, which says global warming is a threat to the world's poor and calls on governments to work together to solve the problem. A 192-page Italian-language version of the encyclical, set to be released Thursday, was leaked by L'Espresso . An official statement from the Vatican says the document does not represent the final text, and a spokesman told Bloomberg that the leak was a \"heinous act.\" The document, titled \"Laudato Sii,\" is meant to influence the United Nations climate talks in Paris at the end of the year, but is expected to also\u00a0make waves in the national debate about climate change. Green groups and the faith community are calling it potentially one of the most influential documents on climate change, while skeptics have been quick to dismiss the potential impact. Based on a Google translation of the document, here's what you need to know about what the draft says. 1) Global warming is real While the document largely focuses on theology and morality, it does go headlong into the science of the causes and impacts of climate change. The draft document says there is a scientific consensus that the climate is warming because of human actions, and that it is reflected in rising sea levels and increasing extreme weather events. The document even goes further into specific consequences of climate change on biodiversity and marine life, among others. 2) Fossil fuels are a problem The encyclical states that fossil fuels, such as oil and to a lesser extent natural gas, should be phased out without delay\u00a0in favor of renewable energy. While renewable power is built up, the encyclical says, it is permissible to rely on fossil fuels, but that overall, the extraction and burning of oil and gas is evil. The document further calls for countries to adopt policies that will reduce emissions of carbon dioxides and other gases. One policy that Francis dismisses is the use of carbon credits, which he says could give rise to speculation rather than direct action to reduce emissions. 3) Governments should act on climate change\u2014and do it right The timing of the encyclical is no mystery\u2014Vatican officials have said the document is meant to influence the United Nations climate talks in Paris this year. Francis repeatedly calls on governments to fight climate change, both domestically and through international agreements. Francis says previous international negotiations, specifically the 2012 UN meetings in Rio de Janeiro, produced ineffective results because countries were looking after the own interests rather than the common good. Francis also is\u00a0calling on countries to set their own long-term policies on climate change, warning that environmental regulations should not change as governments come in and out of power. 4) Poor people are feeling the impact Given Francis's focus on the poor throughout his papacy, it was expected that his encyclical would highlight how climate change has impacted poor nations and communities. The document says that the impacts will fall heaviest on developing countries, which will feel a greater brunt from warming and are seeing depletion of crops, water, and other natural resources. Further, Francis points out that poor people may flee countries because of environmental degradation and decries a general indifference to this plight from the developed world. 5) Rich countries should take the burden The document goes after inaction by developed nations, which Francis says have been consuming resources without concern for the planet and the poor. Francis highlights other negative impacts of the developed world, such as the privatization of green spaces and the improper disposal of resources by industrial activity. Because of that, Francis says that it's incumbent on developed countries to consider the needs of the poor while addressing climate change and emissions. Earlier action, he says, was held back by countries trying to protect their own interests rather than thinking globally; a future agreement, he says, must rely on developed countries taking responsibility for their previous emissions and cutting back on consumption, while also helping poorer countries invest in renewable energy.

{"id":null,"body":"If you are not the sort of person who watches\u00a0 Meet the Press , allow us to provide a point-by-point fact-check of the Bill Nye-Marsha Blackburn debate. In short:\u00a0Blackburn was full of misinformation and Nye seemed sleepy. If you are not the sort of person who watches Meet the Press (because you are not an old person), you may have missed Sunday's \"debate\" between Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn and Mr. William Nye, Science Guy. Allow me to summarize: There is no actual debate over climate change. Allow me to summarize at greater length: Blackburn was full of misinformation and Nye seemed sleepy. I pulled out the assertions presented by the participants in the discussion and evaluated them for truth. That's the point of a debate, right? To use facts to make a point? The Meet the Press conversation mirrored the climate change \"debate\" at large, which is far less a debate than a siege between people who will and people who will not accept the presented scientific facts. Here's an example of how this will work. The segment, which you can watch here , begins inauspiciously, with a quote from NBC weatherguy Al Roker. Al Roker : Rating:  False What Roker's doing here is what you might call skepticism-once-removed. He's too smart and too prominent to deny that climate change exists, but he also doesn't want to get nasty emails from people who hate the idea that anyone would say climate change exists. (I, however, welcome such emails !) So he walks a wishy-washy and incorrect middle road: climate change is real, but is it humanity's fault? It is humanity's fault, at least according to the same scientists that say it is happening, which is nearly every climate scientist with only a few isolated exceptions. A survey of climate studies completed last year found that 97 percent of 4,000 studies blamed human activity for warmer temperatures \u00a0\u2014 more greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-burning leading to more heat trapped in the atmosphere. Roker is wrong. That was an error before the discussion even began, compiled when host David Gregory showed a snippet of a climate change denier from the Cato Institute, which was completely wrong. (He claimed that people lived more places which explained an increase in expensive disasters. Which doesn't explain the big increase in such disasters in the U.S. ) So what did the guests have to say? After Blackburn reminded people that Bill Nye was \"an engineer and actor,\" she insisted that they look at \"the information that we get from climate scientists.\" Here are the show's other factual assertions, in chronological order. Blackburn : Rating:  True In fact, almost every scientist says that no single weather event is due to climate change specifically. Climate and weather are not the same thing: the former addresses long-term trends; the latter, short-term events. ( This video offers a terrific visualization of the difference.) So while climate change will mean more of certain types of events \u2014\u00a0rainier storms, more ferocious hurricanes, more flooding \u2014 they themselves don't prove climate change. Blackburn's both responding to how Gregory framed the segment, using recent weather events as a news hook, but also intentionally trying to suggest that there's no link between weather and climate. Which, in the aggregate, there is. Or, as Nye says in his rebuttal: \"That you cannot tie any one event to that is not the same as doubt about the whole thing.\" Blackburn : Rating:  False Blackburn tries to downplay the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by talking about the amounts in very, very small decimals. Which they are: If I took $400 versus $320 out of your million dollars, you wouldn't be terribly upset. But that's intentionally misleading. The difference between the two is an increase of 25 percent over the past 50 years \u2014\u00a0after thousands and thousands of years of it being lower. Last year, The New York Times  explained that the level of carbon dioxide now in our atmosphere is a \"concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.\" And at that point, \"the world\u2019s ice caps were smaller, and the sea level might have been as much as 60 or 80 feet higher.\" Why hasn't that happened now? Because \"it takes a long time to melt ice,\" as one scientist told the Times . But we're getting there. Blackburn : Rating:  False This is just cherry-picking. Finding two people who disagree with the thousands of other scientists doesn't constitute debate any more than scoring a field goal when you're down 70 points makes the game a tie. What's more, as MSNBC's Ned Resnikoff points out , Blackburn didn't even pick very good cherries. Blackburn : Rating:  Mostly true During the discussion between Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo and EPA administrator Gina McCarthy (which can be seen here ), McCarthy did say that the 26 steps the EPA would like to adopt to scale back America's greenhouse gas pollution wouldn't, in themselves, solve climate change. That's because other countries \u2014\u00a0like China \u2014\u00a0wouldn't be affected and would continue to pump out carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. But that doesn't mean that there would be no impact. If the American example of fighting emissions could serve as a model for other countries, it would have broader value. Fighting climate change is not something we can win by ourselves. We didn't win World War II by ourselves either. It took multiple countries coming together to defeat the Axis threat. What McCarthy, the head of our environmental military, suggests is that we get on a war footing. Nye : Rating:  False Let's get this out of the way: Bill Nye looked tired. He was in California, and it was early, but there's no question this was not the perky Bill Nye that used to freak out at us in his science TV show. That said, Nye simply misspoke. The Antarctic has not seen significantly less ice. As I noted last month, because there is land under Antarctica, its behavior is different than the ice in the Arctic. \"[Antarctica] is losing continental ice while sea ice has been increasing by about 1 percent a decade,\" one scientist explained to The Guardian . Nye meant to refer to the Arctic , where sea ice has continually been decreasing, to the point that it now serves as an effective shipping lane in summer months. How do I know he meant to refer to the Arctic? He held up a picture of the Arctic, as seen above. At some point, probably in the next decade, the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer. That's the fact Nye wants Blackburn to agree to. Blackburn : Rating:  False Blackburn's main point \u2014 in fact, the main point of her Republican colleagues and of the fossil fuel industry at large \u2014\u00a0is that stopping climate change would be expensive. Which is largely true: It means that coal plants and heavy industry wouldn't be able to release greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere for free where the long-term costs would be borne by other people in the form of increased floods or droughts. ThinkProgress did a good job rebutting the \"CO2 is good for plants\" schtick. While small amounts of the gas are critical for plants to grow, it points out that the California drought, almost certainly exacerbated by \u00a0if not entirely due to \u00a0climate change, has hardly been a boon for the state's agricultural centers. The site also explains a bit more about the \"social cost of carbon.\" That cost \"is the formula used by federal regulators to calculate how carbon pollution harms public health, the environment, property value, and other issues\" \u2014\u00a0and could be as much as $129 per ton by 2020 under some emissions scenarios. Again, Blackburn claims there's ambiguity to the figure. In part that's because the cost varies depending on how much we keep emitting.\u00a0 If Blackburn and her colleagues accept a value for that \"social cost,\" her cost-benefit analysis starts to work against polluters. After all, any cost to prevent the emission of carbon dioxide that's less than $129 a ton (or whatever the final figure) becomes preferable under any cost-benefit analysis, even if it mandates regulation of the industry. And polluters and their advocates don't want to incur any additional cost, because it's bad for profits. Nye : Rating:  True If you want to fight climate change, you have to fight carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. And if you want to fight those emissions, you need to limit emissions from coal-burning power plants, the main source of CO2 emissions . And you need to use less energy in general, reducing the need to burn coal to create electricity. You need to see less waste in the transmission process. It's a pretty simple calculus. Blackburn : Rating:  True The World Resources Institute released a report in 2012 that articulated the upcoming boom in new coal plants \u2014\u00a0some 1,199 planned in 59 countries. In some cases, these are developing countries that are starting to see an emergent and energy-hungry middle class. In other cases, it's additional capacity in nations like China. Blackburn's point from this is theoretically that we should look for a \"way to achieve efficiencies\" in coal-burning, which isn't really clearly explained in this context. But really she's undermining her own point: the issue of carbon emissions is only becoming more urgent, and the need to provide a disincentive for building those 1,199 plants more critical. Which Obama has proposed. In his climate change speech last year, the president introduced new policies aimed at making new coal-burning plants less economically appealing. Blackburn : Rating:  False It's true that carbon emissions had been on the decline, hitting levels in 2012 that were the lowest in a long time, but in 2013 emissions went back up . While increased efficiency,\u00a0one of the factors Blackburn cites,\u00a0did help keep emissions low, the two other big reasons emissions fell during recent years were the slower economy (resulting in less electricity use) and the natural gas boom from fracking (meaning less coal-burning). To keep emissions down, we would need to keep moving from coal to natural gas as an electricity source, which Blackburn doesn't want to do. David Gregory : Rating:  False The debate is over. If Meet the Press covered the topic more \u2014\u00a0in 2013, according to Media Matters , it failed \"to offer a single substantial mention of climate change\" \u2014 Gregory might know that.","headline":"Fact-Checking the Bill Nye-Marsha Blackburn Climate Change 'Debate'","article_name":358149.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/02\/fact-checking-bill-nye-marsha-blackburn-climate-change-debate\/358149\/","date_published":"2014-02-17 12:31:00","article_length":10330,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:52.876733","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/02\/fact-checking-bill-nye-marsha-blackburn-climate-change-debate\/358149\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new report suggests that the Inflation Reduction Act could be even bigger than Congress thinks. Sign up for The Weekly Planet, Robinson Meyer\u2019s newsletter about living through climate change, here. Late last month, analysts at the investment bank Credit Suisse published a research note about America\u2019s new climate law that went nearly unnoticed. The Inflation Reduction Act, the bank argued, is even more important than has been recognized so far: The IRA will \u201cwill have a profound effect across industries in the next decade and beyond\u201d and could ultimately shape the direction of the American economy, the bank said. The report shows how even after the bonanza of climate-bill coverage earlier this year, we\u2019re still only beginning to understand how the law works and what it might mean for the economy. The report made a few broad points in particular that are worth attending to: First, the IRA might spend twice as much as Congress thinks. Many of the IRA\u2019s most important provisions, such as its incentives for electric vehicles and zero-carbon electricity, are \u201cuncapped\u201d tax credits. That means that as long as you meet their terms, the government will award them: There\u2019s no budget or limit written into the law that restricts how much the government can spend. The widely cited figure for how much the IRA will spend to fight climate change\u2014$ 374 billion \u2014is in large part determined by the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of how much those tax credits will get used. But that estimate is wrong, the bank claims. In fact, so many people and businesses will use those tax credits that the IRA\u2019s total spending is likely to be more than $800 billion, double what the CBO projects. And because federal spending tends to catalyze private investment, that could send total climate spending across the economy to roughly $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. That\u2019s significantly more money flowing into green-energy industries than the CBO projected, though it\u2019s unclear if that additional money will lead to more carbon reductions than earlier analyses have projected. Second, the U.S. is \u201cpoised to become the world\u2019s leading energy provider,\u201d according to the bank. America is already the world\u2019s largest producer of oil and natural gas. The IRA could further enhance its advantage in all forms of energy production, giving it a \u201ccompetitive advantage in low-cost clean electricity and hydrogen production, infrastructure, geologic storage, and human capital,\u201d the report states. By 2029, U.S. solar and wind could be the cheapest in the world at less than $5 per megawatt-hour, the bank projects; it will also become competitive in hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and wind turbines. (The law will help America\u2019s battery industry, but the bank doesn\u2019t see the U.S. becoming the world\u2019s biggest battery producer, given that China already has such a dominant advantage.) Perhaps rosiest of all was the bank\u2019s view of major risks to the IRA. The bill passed with not even a single Republican vote, but the bank concludes that the GOP is relatively unlikely to repeal the law, even if they take the White House in 2024. That\u2019s because it would hurt their own voters most: \u201cRepublican-leaning states are likely to see the most investment, job, and economic benefits from the IRA,\u201d the report claims. Instead, the IRA is most likely to stumble because America still struggles with building out its energy infrastructure: The country might not be able to get government approval to permit enough power lines, green infrastructure, and carbon-injection wells for the law to matter, the bank said. This risk is all the more heightened now that Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s permitting-reform bill\u2014which, for all its flaws, would have clearly allowed for more renewable transmission construction \u2014has failed. Powerful business groups are also lobbying to revise the most transmission-friendly sections from that bill if Congress revisits it. The Credit Suisse report is truly remarkable. What stuck with me most was this declaration: For big corporations, the IRA \u201cdefinitively changes the narrative from risk mitigation to opportunity capture.\u201d In other words, companies should no longer worry that they might be unprepared for future climate regulation, such as a carbon tax. They should be scared of missing out on the economic growth that the energy transition (and the IRA) will bring about. If the bill\u2019s passage wasn\u2019t signal enough, the report shows that climate change as a political issue\u2014and frankly environmental protection more broadly\u2014has arrived to a wholly new place. For decades, the country\u2019s biggest climate advocates have tried to reduce the harm that the economy causes to the environment. Now they find themselves tasked with the biggest story in the economy itself. Perhaps most strange, even if the United States slips into recession in the next year, the IRA will only become more important. Historically, economists and businesses have treated helping the environment as a product of prosperity\u2014if the economy is good, then companies can afford to do the right thing. But the IRA\u2019s programs and incentives will keep flowing no matter the macro environment, which makes betting on clean energy one of the most certain economic trends of the next few years. Clean energy is now the safe, smart, government-backed bet for conservative investors. It\u2019s really a shocking reversal of the past 40 years. It is such a change that it hasn\u2019t yet been metabolized by the world of people involved in the issue. So inspired by the vigor of Credit Suisse\u2019s forecast, let me venture a few predictions of my own. The number of Americans working in a climate-relevant industry is going to explode. It is going to undergo what you might call a techification . I was a nerd and a dreamer in high school in the late aughts, which meant I paid attention to the start-ups of that era\u2014such as Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr\u2014in their early years. I remember that fateful moment around 2010 when the valence of the industry switched\u2014it was right around when The Social Network came out\u2014and working in tech went from being a career choice for dorky optimists to the default career track for many ambitious college students. A similar switch is coming for companies working on climate change: The opportunity will be too large, the money too persuasive, the problems too intriguing. Finally, those of us who have long worked in climate change\u2014and here I include myself, who started covering this topic in 2015\u2014should have some excitement and even humility about this deluge of new talent. Even setting its arduous politics aside, managing climate change is a legitimately difficult technical and cultural problem\u2014it\u2019s going to require as many attentive and enthusiastic brains as possible, and the path to decarbonizing always required an infusion of new workers, investment, and good will. If you don\u2019t yet work in the industry, but have always cared about climate change as an issue, well, this is your moment to get involved. These companies are going to need engineers, yes, but also programmers, accountants, marketers, HR staff, general counsels\u2014there is space for everyone now. The fight against climate change is going to change more in the next four years than it has in the past 40. The great story of our lives is just beginning. Welcome aboard.","headline":"The Climate Economy Is About to Explode","article_name":671659.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/10\/inflation-reduction-act-climate-economy\/671659\/","date_published":"2022-10-05 14:30:00","article_length":7361,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:53.751215","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/10\/inflation-reduction-act-climate-economy\/671659\/","source":"atlantic"}

It is true that there is not unanimity in the scientific community over the role of humans in climate change. But with over 97 percent of scientists agreeing that warming is linked to human behavior, science is as close to unanimity as it's likely to get. Researchers from a number of universities and institutes \u2014\u00a0including, we'll note, some that do advocacy work \u2014\u00a0looked at nearly 12,000 peer-reviewed studies released between 1991 and 2011 that contained references to global warming in their abstracts. The team was looking for whether or not the papers addressed the cause of warming; in other words, if people are to blame. Of those 11,944 papers, the majority didn't take a position on causation.\u00a0(AGW below is shorthand for scientific term: \"anthropogenic global warming.\") But considering only those papers that did suggest a cause, the consensus was overwhelming.

As time has passed \u2014\u00a0and as indicators of warming have become more apparent \u2014\u00a0the number of papers addressing the topic have increased, as have the number of papers suggesting that humans are to blame. John Cook, lead author of the study, created a video walking through the findings. You can watch it below. But it can be summarized in less than the three-and-a-half minutes Cook spends by simply saying this: There is no debate over climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"The economic damage could be especially severe for poor countries. If left unchecked, climate change could worsen the gap between rich and poor countries, according to a new study\u2014a finding that could add more urgency to international negotiations at the end of the year. The study , published Wednesday in the journal Nature , found that above a median ideal temperature, a warming climate stunts economic growth. Overall, unmitigated climate change could shrink the global economy by 23 percent by the end of the century, based on current growth in carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201cThe benefits of reducing emissions are even larger than we thought,\u201d said study co-author Marshall Burke, an assistant professor in Earth system science at Stanford University. \u201cWhereas before, a lot of things had looked too cost-prohibitive, now we should be willing to incur even greater costs to avoid these kinds of impacts.\u201d The authors looked at World Bank data for 166 countries between 1960 and 2010, comparing it with\u00a0climatological data, and found that there was an ideal temperature at which countries seemed to be best at economic production: 13 degrees Celsius, or roughly 55 degrees Fahrenheit. For countries averaging below that temperature, like those in Scandinavia, a warmer year meant more production. Above the benchmark, however, each degree meant less economic production. That\u2019s due to a variety of factors, including reduced agricultural output and health problems associated with warmer temperatures. But even the most developed economies took a hit when temperatures rose. (Previous studies have shown that car production goes down at U.S. factories in the heat.) Studies have shown that climate change has implications for damaging infrastructure, increasing energy use, and even exacerbating conflict\u2014all smaller impacts that Burke said were reflected in the larger macro-level study. Even though some economies are trending up despite rising temperatures, Burke said that the larger trend shows that there could be impacts felt down the road. The study did not account for stronger hurricanes or sea-level rise, other potential impacts from climate change that could cause even more economic damage. The researchers said that some countries whose average temperature is below the 13-degree benchmark\u2014such as Russia, Canada, and parts of Europe\u2014would actually see an economic boost. In the poorest 40 percent of countries, however, the economic hit could be as high as 75 percent by the end of the century. The average global temperature was 13.9 degrees Celsius, or 57 degrees, in the 20th century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Last year, the hottest on record, saw the average temperature rise to 58.24 degrees and scientists are projecting that 2015 will top that. The findings come just weeks before countries are set to meet at a United Nations conference in Paris to hash out a global climate-change agreement. Pete Ogden, a former White House climate-change staffer, said that the economic impacts should give more urgency to negotiators from all countries. \u201cThis is another indication of the need for global action. This study suggests it\u2019s not so simple as turning up the air-conditioning units; there are things that are more profound in every country in the world,\u201d said Ogden, now a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress. \u201cThere\u2019s broad recognition that the most vulnerable countries and the most vulnerable people will be put at risk, but this casts the net much wider.\u201d","headline":"Study: Climate Change Could Shrink Global Economy 23 Percent","article_name":452994.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/10\/study-climate-change-could-shrink-global-economy-23-percent\/452994\/","date_published":"2015-10-21 22:18:00","article_length":3540,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:54.910348","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/10\/study-climate-change-could-shrink-global-economy-23-percent\/452994\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Among Americans who grew up on MTV and grunge, a campaign of disinformation has created deep apathy about our warming planet. Generation Xers grew up with MTV, Nirvana, and the dot-com bubble. Today, Americans born roughly between 1961 and 1981 are better educated and work longer hours than their parents, sit on their childrens' school boards, and take active roles in their communities. But when it comes to climate change, Gen Xers voice a resounding \"meh.\" That's the result of a University of Michigan study that polled some 3,000 Gen Xers and found that in the last several years their overall interest in climate change has waned. Sociologist Jon Miller, the study's author, sees this as a sign of victory for the climate disinformation campaign . \"I was optimistic beacuse this group of people is more scientifically literate; they've grown up in an era of of science and quantitative discussion, unlike their grandparents,\" Miller says. But the complexity of climate science, the long time scale it takes to play out, and seeds of doubt sown on the nightly news have caused many Gen Xers to simply tune it out. The data shows a broad \"migration to the middle,\" says Miller, with passionate voices on both ends of the spectrum quieting down in favor of passive disengagement. Climate change is one of the most politicized scientific issues in recent history. Miller says that when faced with loud debate over a subject they don't fully understand and whose full impacts seem to be on the horizon, most people will just stick with their political party lines. \"Democracy works best on short-term issues, so [climate change] is a real challenge,\" he says. But stepping outside the Gen X bubble, a string of recent climate-related surveys suggest a society more ready and willing to grapple with global warming could be in the offing. In December, a Pew poll found a \"modest\" rise in the number of people who see solid evidence of global warming. A Gallup survey in April found that 70 percent of Americans support higher greenhouse gasemissions standards for business and industry. And this month, a Washington Post -Stanford University study found that while climate change is no longer Americans' top environmental concern, three-quarters believe the planet is warming and that it will continue to do so if nothing is done. So what gives, Gen Xers? Miller said one of the most reliable ways to grab Gen Xers' attentions was with issues that affect the daily lives of their kids--the flu, for example. Maybe climate science communicators need to do a better job convincing young parents that the state of the world their kids will grow up in--one with higher seas , worse storms , punishing summers --is something they should think about today .","headline":"Why Do Generation X Americans Not Care About Climate Change?","article_name":259955.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/07\/why-do-generation-x-americans-not-care-about-climate-change\/259955\/","date_published":"2012-07-17 17:57:17","article_length":2753,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:55.797166","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/07\/why-do-generation-x-americans-not-care-about-climate-change\/259955\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Texas Board of Education member David Bradley wants to set the record straight on global warming. \"Whether global warming is a myth or whether it's actually happening, that's very much up for debate,\" Bradley said. \"Don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.\" Bradley is not a climate scientist, but he's about to make big decisions governing what Texas students learn about climate change. In November, Bradley and the rest of the state's 15-member board will vote to adopt new social-studies textbooks for public schools from kindergarten to 12th grade. When he does, he says that part of his mission will be to shield Lone Star schoolchildren from radical green rhetoric. Instead, Bradley plans to push for textbooks that teach climate-science doubt\u2014presenting the link between greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity and global warming as an unsubstantiated and controversial theory. For people who do study the climate for a living, that mission is infuriating as it misrepresents the state of climate science: Surveys of peer-reviewed academic studies show that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of global warming. That's not universal agreement, but it's a far cry from the \"some-say-yes-some-say-no\" treatment of the topic that Bradley hopes to see in Texas classrooms. When it comes time to review the textbooks, however, Bradley will have plenty of instructional materials created by some of the publishing industry's major players to back his viewpoint. Here's how McGraw-Hill\u2014the second-largest publisher of educational materials and a mainstay of the Texas public-school system\u2014describes climate change in a proposed textbook for sixth graders. Scientists agree that Earth's climate is changing. They do not agree on what is causing the change. Is it just another natural warming cycle like so many cycles that have occurred in the past? Scientists who support this position cite thousands of years' worth of natural climatic change as evidence. Or is climate change anthropogenic\u2014caused by human activity? Scientists who support this position cite the warming effect of rapidly increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases occur naturally, but they also result from the burning of fossil fuels. Which side's evidence is more convincing? A fifth-grade social studies textbook submitted by Pearson\u2014the largest educational publisher in the world\u2014similarly casts doubt on the science. Burning oil to run cars also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Some scientists believe that this carbon dioxide could lead to a slow heating of Earth's overall climate. This temperature change is known as global warming or climate change. Scientists disagree about what is causing climate change.\u00a0 The Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning education watchdog, says this fits a disturbing pattern of textbook companies peddling climate denial to Texas students. The watchdog group commissioned an independent review of the textbooks by the National Center for Science Education. Out of 19 textbooks surveyed, at least seven\u2014including several from high-profile publishers that have gotten approval from the Board of Education in the past\u2014distort scientific fact, the study found. \"It's really an insult to science,\" said Minda Berbeco, the National Center for Science Education's programs and policy director. \"The old line was that global warming didn't exist. Now we're starting to see more people say it exists but human activity isn't responsible. That's just denial by another name.\" The skirmish over Texas textbooks is part of a national battle over climate education. Science-education activists are pushing states to adopt a new set of science standards that reflect the scientific consensus on global warming, rather than the popular controversy. The academic framework, known as the Next Generation Science Standards, has been endorsed by organizations such as the National Science Teachers Association and the American Meteorological Society. But the standards have faced intense pushback from conservatives and tea-party groups in a number of states. Earlier this year, Wyoming legislators blocked the standards due to the climate-change requirement. South Carolina's Legislature also passed a bill that would prohibit the standards from being adopted. The Texas textbooks currently under review are not strictly focused on science, but climate change has cropped up as part of lessons on geography, economics, and American government. The books were written to conform to social-studies standards set by the state board in 2010, a set of guidelines that Bradley helped write. What happens next? The Texas education commissioner, a former chairman of the agency that oversees the state's oil and gas industry, will tell the board which textbooks he believes should be approved. In November, the board is expected to take an up-or-down vote on the recommended textbooks. After that, school districts receive a list of approved textbooks. Teachers are not required to purchase any particular instructional material, but schools have to show compliance with state education standards. And buying textbooks that have been approved by the board is a quick and easy way to show compliance. Most public school districts use textbooks from the state-approved list, according to records from the Texas Education Agency. If flawed science finds its way into the classroom, it could become firmly rooted in the minds of the state's citizenry, said Dan Quinn, a spokesperson for the Texas Freedom Network: \"If kids don't learn the facts about climate change, they're going to grow up to become uneducated citizens and voters.\" Education activists also worry that if the textbooks containing climate-change doubt win approval, they could wind up in classrooms across the country. Texas is the second-largest market in the U.S. for textbooks after California. Publishers consider making it onto the approved list in the Lone Star State a major prize, and they often resell textbooks designed to meet Texas standards in other states. Bradley, however, is not concerned. \"These groups are always complaining. Now they're unhappy because the textbooks are taking a softened approach towards claims of global warming,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of radical advocacy about that in the past, but I think we're starting to move away from that, and that's not a bad thing. It's not all doom and gloom.\"","headline":"Proposed Texas Textbooks Teach Climate-Change Doubt","article_name":445038.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/proposed-texas-textbooks-teach-climate-change-doubt\/445038\/","date_published":"2014-09-15 13:00:01","article_length":6491,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:56.507223","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/proposed-texas-textbooks-teach-climate-change-doubt\/445038\/","source":"atlantic"}

By yesterday afternoon, more than 600,000 customers faced a blackout, including hundreds of hospitals, the utility said. But that number belies the scale of the shutoff: An entire apartment building can count as a single \u201ccustomer,\u201d according to The New York Times . In one sense, the blackout was caused by an overlapping set of crises\u2014legal, financial, and ecological\u2014that now confronts the state. But in a larger sense, it looked like a preview of mid-21st-century governance. When political leaders envision the century of climate change to come, they often speak of massive floods and dangerous droughts. But the experience of Californians this week\u2014frustrated, needlessly inconvenienced, and saddled with aging infrastructure built for the wrong century\u2014will define the mass experience of climate change as much as any deluge or inferno. Read: The simple reason that humans can\u2019t control wildfires That is in part because blackouts\u2014while not as deadly or terrifying as wildfires\u2014are nonetheless expensive in their own right. Outages this week could cost the American economy as much as $2.5 billion, says Michael Wara , a lawyer and energy-policy scholar at Stanford University. His estimate, calculated using a tool from the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, assumes that the blackout will eventually reach its planned length (48 hours) and planned size (800,000 customers). Most of that $2.5 billion will be silently incurred by businesses, since many offices must restrict their hours or close altogether in a blackout. But costs will propagate through the economy. Tens of thousands of families must now sort through spoiled food and restock their freezers. Others will spend money they would have spent elsewhere coping with the blackout. And people who depend on medical equipment to survive must decide whether to temporarily leave town, invest in a generator, or risk going without until the power returns. Of course, autumn is always an inconvenient time in California, as it is the heart of wildfire season. With winter rains not yet arrived and any springtime moisture long since sapped by the summer heat, October and November are when the state\u2019s forest and chaparral are at their most parched. This week, the state faces another major cause of fires: hot, arid gusts that can knock over power lines while further drying out the soil. But in the warming climate, California\u2019s wildfires are getting worse. Half of its 10 largest wildfires ever, and seven of its 10 most destructive, have happened in the past decade. Since 1972, the state\u2019s annual burned area has increased fivefold , a trend attributable to a 2.5-degree-Fahrenheit rise in summer temperatures, according to a recent peer-reviewed study . And while PG&E induced the blackouts to avoid wildfires, it is also responding to its own financial incentives. Earlier this year, a state investigation concluded that PG&E power lines caused the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history. The fire killed 85 people and destroyed almost 20,000 buildings, including the entire town of Paradise, last November. (The utility has conceded that its lines were \u201clikely\u201d to blame for the blaze.) Read: A disaster of our own making Under California law, utilities must pay for any damage from a wildfire that was sparked by their own equipment. But PG&E\u2014which is owned by private investors\u2014said that it could not afford to pay damages both for the Camp Fire and for several 2017 wildfires that it also caused. So it declared bankruptcy , becoming the first corporate bankruptcy triggered by climate change. Last month, it paid out an $11 billion insurance claim over the Camp Fire and other blazes. The full cost of the Camp Fire was $16.5 billion, according to the reinsurance giant Munich Re . The fire was the most expensive natural disaster anywhere in the world last year. And for many people, it\u2019s straightforward to think of its terrible damage\u2014or the multibillion-dollar floods that plagued the Midwest this year\u2014as the cost and consequence of climate change. But the warning from California this week is that the $2.5 billion incurred by the blackouts is also a cost of climate change. The tedium of waiting in long lines for gasoline, the desperation of leaving the state and sleeping in a hotel, even the frustration of searching every nearby Home Depot for a generator\u2014these costs are every bit as real, and every bit as climate-related, as those incurred by more biblical means. They are also just as real as the measures it would take to upgrade our infrastructure. I sometimes hear politicians rosily speculate that we\u2019ll adapt to climate change and rising temperatures. And we will, somewhat, especially if we limit carbon pollution and the ensuing scale of global warming. But until the federal government invests serious money in retrofitting American infrastructure\u2014and preparing it for the climate to come\u2014then \u201cadapting to climate change\u201d will mean skipping your kid\u2019s soccer game so you can be the 26th car in line at the Exxon.","headline":"This Is What Adapting to Climate Change Looks Like","article_name":599851.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/10\/californias-blackout-warning\/599851\/","date_published":"2019-10-11 12:00:04","article_length":5774,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:57.069905","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/10\/californias-blackout-warning\/599851\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In deserts around the world, creatures and plants are struggling as their habitats warm. Desert ecologist Cameron Barrows is a sand country cowboy. His white-brown beard and wide cotton hat deflect the brutal sun as he leads volunteers\u2014citizen scientists\u2014through Joshua Tree National Park. They weave past smooth orange boulders and the menacing white spines of cholla cacti, on the lookout for lizards and tortoises. Barrows\u2019 band is sweeping 27 sites in California\u2019s High Desert in an effort to understand how climate change impacts the populations of local reptiles , including western whiptails, desert iguanas, and chuckwallas, which are foot-long, vegetarian lizards. Long droughts\u2014like California's current five-year episode\u2014have been hard on creatures in the park, especially at the hottest low-elevation sites. When healthy, chuckwallas are especially \u201crotund,\u201d like \u201ca lizard that could be mistaken for Shrek,\u201d Barrows says. But now, \u201cthey\u2019re just not plump, chubby chuckwallas anymore.\u201d You\u2019d think desert creatures would love climate change. They already thrive in the hottest, driest places on earth. But Barrows sees their numbers \u201cdwindling,\u201d an observation that reflects a larger trend: From Southern Africa to the Southwestern U.S., arid environments are becoming even less hospitable, and their denizens\u2014animals as well as plants\u2014seem to be struggling to keep up. A growing body of research suggests many desert species are already pushed to their physiological limits. In California\u2019s Mojave and Sonoran deserts, tortoises and chuckwallas are already losing habitat, which could constrict by up to 88 percent if temperatures rise by two degrees. Joshua Tree National Park could lose up to 90 percent of its eponymous trees if already-sweltering July temperatures rise by another three degrees. From Arizona to Australia, hotter, longer, and more frequent heat waves could cause massive die-offs for desert birds like hummingbirds and thornbills. And in the hot, sandy soils of South Africa and Namibia, dwarf succulents may disappear by 2069. \u201cLife is always living on the edge in these places,\u201d says plant scientist Andrew Young, the lead researcher on the dwarf succulent study. \u201cAny shift could have really serious consequences, but we\u2019re only starting to understand it now.\u201d Young and his colleagues work in a dry region of southwestern Africa that is basically plant-lover heaven. It's called the \u201cSucculent Karoo,\u201d and boasts more than 5,000 plant species , including a third of all succulents. If you\u2019ve got a split rock plant or coral aloe growing at home, chances are you\u2019re tending a Karoo native. Out there, dwarf succulents called Conophytum or \u201c cone plants \u201d are resilient as they come . On first inspection, they look more like pebbles than living things. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful,\u201d Young says, laughing. \u201cSome are tiny, just a few millimeters across. Others are much bigger. There\u2019s huge variation, and huge variability.\u201d Since these mini succulents are so diverse, and tough as rocks (literally), scientists expected them to thrive even as temperatures rise. But when Young mapped the distributions of 159 species across 3,000 desert sites, he found that many grow on specific types of rock, like quartz, or live in narrow temperature bands. If climate patterns change as global models predict, so will these microhabitats, and the dwarf succulents will have nowhere to go. Fifty to 100 percent of their habitat could disappear in the next 50 years. Cacti and succulents as far away as Texas and Mexico could face similar risks, Young worries, because they\u2019ve adapted to extreme environments in many of the same ways. \u201cMost people thought these were some of the best-adapted [plants] around,\u201d he says. \u201cSo then, what are the implications for everything else?\u201d In California\u2019s Joshua Tree National Park, Barrows says many critters will have to migrate to cooler, higher-elevations sites to survive, likely by the end of the decade. That could be too much to ask of slow-moving species, like some lizards, tortoises, and the Joshua trees themselves. And even quick and ubiquitous species like the side-blotched lizard may suffer. These animals are short-lived, and when a generation only lasts 14 months, a multi-year drought can be devastating. \u201cThey\u2019re so common in most places, no one pays them much heed,\u201d Barrows says. But \u201cthe population crashes very quickly.\u201d Today, side-blotched lizards are almost gone from low elevation sites in Joshua Tree, but at higher, cooler, and wetter elevations, their numbers are actually increasing, Barrows says. If populations may keep moving upward as temperatures rise, eventually there will be nowhere left to run. That forecast may seem bleak, but by tracking the effects of climate change now, and its predicted impacts in the future, Barrows hopes to find oases in the desert. On his excursions into the park, he records the age and location of each reptile he finds, and plots his sightings on a series of maps. By comparing the maps over time, he can see patterns of change across the landscape, and pockets of relative stability. Those pockets are key to sustained conservation in the park, because they are the places where species will hold out, \u201ceven if climate change gets really bad,\u201d Barrows says. Rather than hot, dry wastes\u2014immune to the effects of climate\u2014deserts, as scientists like Barrows see them, are a canary in the coal mine. They\u2019re \u201cour first glimpse into how severe climate change might get,\u201d Barrows says. By watching how they change, and how they don\u2019t, perhaps we can better prepare for an uncertain future.","headline":"Climate Change May Be as Hard on Lizards as on Polar Bears","article_name":483896.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/05\/climate-change-deserts\/483896\/","date_published":"2016-05-23 16:29:00","article_length":5606,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:57.878814","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/05\/climate-change-deserts\/483896\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The international politics of addressing climate change are so complicated , so contentious , and so hysterical , that some exasperated observers have suggested we just deal with it later . But why is this issue so difficult? There are many reasons, of course: the influence of powerful business lobbies, the hesitancy of energy-dependent developing states to adopt more expensive efficiency practices, the tragedy of the commons , and a lot more. But does gender play a role? Treehugger's Matthew McDermott finds a recent study by Michigan State University sociologist Aaron McCright , which concludes that there is a climate change gender gap. Women are more likely to believe that climate change is real and caused by humans because, according to the report, culturally ingrained gender norms make them more receptive to believe those things. McDermott asks, \"Ever wonder why it seems the most vocal climate change skeptics are men?\" Here's an excerpt from McCright's report, explaining why men are polluting Mars but women are concerned about the rate of global warming on Venus: McCright goes on to explain why the culturally ingrained gender norms in men not only make them more likely to be wrong, but more likely to believe that their false opinion is absolutely and undeniable correct: McCright's implied conclusion is that the solution isn't for men to try and emulate women--it's for women to take more leadership roles in the scientific community. However, one point McCright misses is that it's not the scientific community slowing down the U.S. climate change response--it's Congress, which just happens to consist of about 16 percent women and 84 percent men.","headline":"How Gender Explains Climate Change Politics","article_name":340079.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/09\/how-gender-explains-climate-change-politics\/340079\/","date_published":"2010-09-15 12:55:43","article_length":1674,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:58.696466","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/09\/how-gender-explains-climate-change-politics\/340079\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The 200-year-old novel is a testament to the innovation that can spring from environmental disaster. Between 2 and 3 o\u2019clock in the morning on June 16, 1816, during a restless night in a villa on Lake Geneva, 18-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin had a waking dream. As the moon shone through the shutters of her room, she remembered, \u201cI saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life \u2026\u201d Over the next 14 months, Godwin\u2014later Mary Shelley \u2014wrote her vision into life. The pale student became Victor Frankenstein, the hideous phantasm became his tortured creature, and Godwin became the author of the novel Frankenstein , published in 1818 and in print ever since. Famously, Godwin\u2019s inspiration arrived after she and her companions, who had spent most of their Swiss holiday trapped inside by extraordinarily cold, rainy weather, decided to entertain themselves with a ghost story writing contest. Lord Byron \u2014already a noted poet and notorious cad\u2014wrote a fragment about a dying explorer. The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley , Godwin\u2019s lover and future husband, wrote a poem about atheism. Byron\u2019s physician, William Polidori , wrote a poem about a vampire, which he later published under Byron\u2019s name (and which, some argue, birthed the modern sexy-vampire story ). The teenaged Mary Godwin outdid them all, creating both the first major work of science fiction and a story that disturbs us still. Though Frankenstein \u2019s most iconic scene may have come to Godwin in an instant, the story is rooted in her time and experience. When Godwin was 14, writes Richard Holmes in The Age of Wonder , her father took her to hear lectures by the renowned chemist Humphry Davy . Davy envisioned a future when humans would \u201cinterrogate Nature with Power,\u201d words later echoed by the fictional Professor Waldman, who tells young Victor Frankenstein that the \u201cmodern masters \u2026 have acquired new and unlimited Powers: they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadow.\u201d Some of Davy\u2019s experiments with electricity inspired the proponents of Vitalism, who believed in the existence of an invisible life force\u2014one that could, perhaps, be tamed and put to monstrous use by \u201cmodern masters.\u201d Both Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley followed the vociferous public debate over Vitalism, and Frankenstein was a direct response to it. The story of Victor Frankenstein\u2019s doomed attempt to control the forces of nature may have also been inspired by nature itself, which in the summer of 1816 must have seemed malevolently out of control. Frost, droughts, and floods killed crops all over the world, and in the years that followed, millions of people starved. Millions more, weakened by hunger, died of cholera and typhoid fever. Villagers in Vermont subsisted on clover and nettles; veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, unable to feed themselves or their families, rioted throughout Europe. Farmers in Yunnan, China, hungry and desperate for cash, filled their fields with poppies, bloating the global opium trade. While some Vitalists might have dreamed of commanding the thunders of heaven, the thunders of 1816 bowed to no one. The crisis, which lasted for nearly three years, was the source of both enormous suffering and great innovation, inspiring advances in agriculture, meteorology, and polar exploration. (The climatic disturbances included a sudden reduction in Arctic sea ice in 1817 and 1818, exciting would-be explorers; while some found success, many were as hapless as Frankenstein \u2019s Captain Walton, who rescues Dr. Frankenstein after he pursues his creature into the Arctic). Historian Gillen D\u2019Arcy Wood argues that the cycle of famines and plagues also led to an expansion of government responsibility for citizens and, in turn, to the modern concept of the state. In the realm of ideas, Wood observes, \u201csudden environmental dislocations act as an extraordinary stimulant.\u201d Godwin, whose chilly Continental vacation stimulated a classic, might agree. Not until the Cold War did climate scientists confirm that all these catastrophes\u2014and triumphs\u2014were caused by the April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in history. The cloud of sulfur dioxide released by the eruption shaded the earth, leading to a prolonged period of global cooling that disrupted the planet\u2019s hydrological cycle. It was a natural experiment in geoengineering, and its results were catastrophic. Two hundred years after Mary Godwin\u2019s nighttime vision, Frankenstein can be read as both a warning of the perils of human hubris and a brilliantly imaginative response to a global disaster. As we enter another era of climate disruption\u2014this time, a monster of our own making\u2014we need both the reminder of the former and the inspiration of the latter.

{"id":null,"body":"The National Climate Assessment arrives as President Trump is dismantling the most sweeping U.S. climate policy. Climate change is real. It\u2019s caused by greenhouse-gas pollution released by human industrial activity. Its consequences can already be felt across every region and coastline of the United States\u2014and, unless we stop emitting greenhouse gases soon, those consequences will almost certainly get worse. Those are the headline findings of the Climate Science Special Report , a sweeping and more than 800-page examination of the evidence. The report was published Friday by four agencies of the U.S. government and academics from across the country. Their conclusions form the first volume of the new National Climate Assessment, a report on the science and impacts of global warming that Congress requires agencies to complete every four years. A draft version of the second volume, on the human impacts of climate change, was also released Friday. \u201cThis is the most comprehensive assessment of climate science currently available in the world, and it reaffirms what we\u2019ve already known,\u201d said Robert Kopp, one of the lead authors of the report and a professor of climate science at Rutgers University. \u201cIf we want to do something like stay under 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the window to do that is closing in the next couple decades.\u201d The two-degree limit is a rough target used by the United Nations to signal the point where dangerous climate change could begin. The report finds that the world can only continue to emit carbon for roughly another 23 years at current levels before it will have a more than two-thirds chance of going over the limit. The Climate Science Special Report comes at an auspicious time in the history of global warming and the United States. The report\u2019s conclusions do not deviate wildly from the last 20 years of consensus in climate science. They do not shock anyone who follows the field. And they don\u2019t break new ground: The authors have synthesized the best available papers; they have not conducted new research for this report. But simply by affirming the science of climate change, the authors\u2014and the interagency bureaucrats who shepherded the writing of the document\u2014provide a contrast to the actions and statements of political figures in the Trump administration. Scott Pruitt, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, has cast doubt on the idea , fundamental to climate science, that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere significantly controls Earth\u2019s climate. President Trump and Pruitt have dismantled the aggressive policies advanced by President Barack Obama meant to reduce U.S. carbon pollution. In October, Pruitt repealed the Clean Power Plan , which would have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector. In June, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement \u2014and, with it, pulled back from Obama\u2019s decision to apply the full force of the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus to reducing carbon pollution worldwide. The assessment is a scientific achievement by itself. The last major synthesis of climate science, as a field, was published in 2013 by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Much has changed over those four years, including significant updates to how the field understands the interaction between global warming and hurricane strength . It is also the end result of a colossal amount of work. The National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Global-Change Research Program both convened expert panels to comb through the report line by line and subject it to meticulous comment and approval. During the writing process, scientists from four federal agencies\u2014including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2014contributed significant writing and expertise. They were joined by researchers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 11 academic institutions, including Columbia University, Texas Tech University, and the Naval Postgraduate School. It is not an overstatement to say that a vast swath of the profession of American climate science played a hand in this report. Its conclusions span the Earth system. Modern climate change is primarily caused by the release of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, which prevent the sun\u2019s heat from escaping back into space. Over the past several decades, this heat has accumulated in the atmosphere and oceans. Now, the United States sets many more extreme heat records than extreme cold records ; it sees more intense heat waves and weaker, briefer cold snaps. That heat is shrinking the ice sheets at the planet\u2019s north and south poles and causing the oceans to expand. The report includes forecasts of how much the sea level will rise around the world. The sea level worldwide has risen by about seven or eight inches since 1900, with three of those inches coming in the last 25 years. This will intensify: The world ocean is almost certain to rise one to four feet by the end of this century. And if some of the fastest scenarios for the melting of the Antarctic come to pass, then the sea could rise as much as eight feet. The report sketches out what that sea-level rise will do to different regions of the United States. The East Coast will likely experience even more of that sea-level rise than the world average. The West Coast will likely experience less\u2014unless Antarctica begins to melt in its entirety, in which case it will also see above-average rise. It also dives into \u201cpotential surprises\u201d that the United States may encounter in a climate-changed world. In that chapter, which previous National Climate Assessments did not include, the authors warn of \u201ccompound extremes,\u201d the risk of multiple unusual weather conditions coming to pass at the same time. For instance, scorching heat and a lack of rain during the same summer will intensify a drought (and increase the chance of wildfires) far more than either one would alone. If excess rain falls on waterlogged ground, then the chance of a devastating flood also rises. It\u2019s hard for scientists to predict how the various extremes of climate change will overlap with each other. The authors caution that current climate models are more likely to underestimate future warming than overestimate it. While climate models have accurately predicted the past few decades of warming, they struggle to describe warmer climates that occurred millions of years ago. Models suggest that these climates should be colder than archaeological and climatic evidence tells us that they were, which means that they may fail to capture how warm Earth can get. There may be tipping points in the climate system\u2014difficult-to-predict points of no return\u2014that researchers may not fully understand. Environmentalists and some government scientists had worried that the Trump administration would try to suppress the release of the report. But some of the authors, speaking anonymously so as not to distract from the release, said they saw little evidence of political interference during the writing process. Some references to the Paris Agreement were removed from the final report, as compared to a draft version leaked over the summer, sources indicated. Environmental groups plan to conduct a line-by-line comparison of the final report with the leaked drafts in the coming days.","headline":"A Major New U.S. Report Affirms: Climate Change Is Getting Worse","article_name":544952.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/a-major-new-us-report-affirms-climate-change-is-getting-worse\/544952\/","date_published":"2017-11-03 18:00:00","article_length":7404,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:56:59.872366","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/11\/a-major-new-us-report-affirms-climate-change-is-getting-worse\/544952\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Seven of the state\u2019s 10 largest modern wildfires have occurred in the last 14 years. Massive wildfires are raging across Southern California, threatening thousands of homes and cultural landmarks like the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Some of the largest fires were still barely contained by Wednesday afternoon. It\u2019s been an unusually bad year for the state\u2014amid an unusually bad year for the West at large. Fires in California have destroyed more than 6,000 structures and incinerated hundreds of thousands of acres. Montana and British Columbia both also had some of their worst wildfire seasons ever. Of course, most years are bad wildfire years now. Seven of California\u2019s 10 largest modern wildfires have occurred in the last 14 years. (The state began keeping reliable records in 1932.) Given the scale of the blazes, and their increasing regularity, it makes sense to ask: Does global warming have anything to do with this? The answer isn\u2019t as clear-cut as it was this summer, when drought- and heat-stoked fires raged across the Rockies and Pacific Northwest . Instead, a mix of forces are driving the fires in Southern California, and only some of them have a clear connection to global warming. \u201cThese fires are not immediately emblematic of climate change,\u201d said John Abatzoglou, an associate professor of geography and climate at the University of Idaho, in an email. \u201cYes, California did have the warmest summer on record. But the big anomaly here is the delay in the onset of precipitation for the southland that has kept the vegetation dry and fire-prone.\u201d In other words, late-fall and winter rains would normally end California\u2019s fire season in November. Because those rains haven\u2019t yet arrived, the blazes continue. \u201cAt least in Southern California right now, we are largely seeing textbook wildfires,\u201d said Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute who studies fires. \u201cWind-driven fire events occur most typically in the fall, but can also occur like this, later in the year with fast-spreading, ember-driven fires under Santa Ana wind conditions.\u201d Here are some of the biggest factors that are shaping the wildfires in California\u2014and how global warming is or isn\u2019t changing them: The Santa Ana winds Blame for the wildfires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties lies first and foremost with the Santa Ana winds, famously hot and desiccating gusts that blow from the desert to the coast. The Santa Anas also set the stage for the massive wildfires in Napa and Sonoma earlier this year. Fires depend on two variables\u2014an ignition source and fuel to burn\u2014and the Santa Ana winds increase the availability of both. First, they dry out vegetation, creating more fuel across the landscape. Second, they blow trees and other debris against power lines, providing the source of a spark. When the Santa Anas blow this late in the year, they can start fires. In fact, writes Abatzoglou, \u201call December fires in the southland since 1948 have been associated with Santa Ana wind.\u201d But there are few signs\u2014at least so far\u2014that the Santa Ana winds are becoming more prevalent or that they\u2019re systematically moving later in the year. The peak of Santa Ana season usually comes in September or October. There is no trend toward more or fewer Santa Ana fires\u2014or Santa Ana winds generally\u2014in the historical record, Abatzoglou told me. A 2006 study from researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggested that by the end of the century, Santa Ana winds may become more common. They may also form later in the year, including in December. La Ni\u00f1a There\u2019s currently a weak La Ni\u00f1a in the tropical Pacific, which means that global temperatures are cooler than they would be otherwise. The same phenomenon is also keeping storms from making landfall in Southern California. Normally, California\u2019s wet season would have started by this time of year. \u201cOnce [autumn] rains hit the region, fuel moistures recover and make the landscape fire-resistant, thus reducing the odds that a power-line failure or vehicle will start a fire,\u201d said Abatzoglou. But the rains haven\u2019t yet appeared, he told me. \u201cSo far this autumn, much of the southern half of California is pitching a shutout in terms of rainfall to date. Some of this is characteristic of La Ni\u00f1a ... as the southern tier of the United States sees less precipitation during La Ni\u00f1a winters.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how climate change will affect the Pacific\u2019s yearly dance between El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a, and a neutral state. A 2015 study in Nature Climate Change found that the Pacific Ocean may careen between extreme states\u2014from an intense El Ni\u00f1o to a monster La Ni\u00f1a\u2014by the end of the century, but more research on the question still needs to be done. A very cold U.S. East Coast Even as the West Coast remains warm and dry, the Eastern Seaboard is settling into some of its first cold weather of the season. This pattern\u2014a warm West, a frigid East\u2014is known as the North American winter dipole. It\u2019s caused when the jet stream\u2014which both ferries storms into the continent and generally divides warm air from cold air\u2014gets especially twisted across North America. It rises far into the Canadian Northwest, keeping most of the western United States warm and dry; then it cascades down across the middle of the country, bringing cold air well into the U.S. Southeast. This phenomenon prolonged California\u2019s drought during the first part of this decade, keeping any kind of storm system offshore. It also brought the infamous \u201cpolar vortex\u201d down into the continental United States. There are a number of theories about how this pattern comes to form, and most of them revolve around climate change , as Jason Samenow writes at The Washington Post. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, argues that the ridge forms in part because the West is warming up much faster than the East. If this is the case, then scientists might expect to see the phenomenon fade in decades to come, as the East Coast catches up to the West. But a paper published this week in Nature Communications  takes another view. It finds that the disappearance of sea ice over the Arctic Ocean could change the circulation of the Pacific Ocean, encouraging the jet stream to veer north. In other words, climate change will make something like the North American winter dipole keep reappearing.","headline":"Did Climate Change Worsen the Southern California Fires?","article_name":547712.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/what-climate-change-did-and-didnt-have-to-do-with-the-socal-fires\/547712\/","date_published":"2017-12-07 00:33:00","article_length":6440,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:00.874295","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/12\/what-climate-change-did-and-didnt-have-to-do-with-the-socal-fires\/547712\/","source":"atlantic"}

In other words: the climate skeptics aren't just in the minority--they're not very good scientists, either.

{"id":null,"body":"American withdrawal from the Paris agreement is a test for the future of the globe, but also for the international order. One year ago, President Trump announced that he planned to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. The decision derived from Trump\u2019s insistence that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d and his determination to overturn as much of his predecessor\u2019s legacy as possible. It also matches with Trump\u2019s insistence that the U.S. doesn\u2019t need the rest of the world. In a material sense, that\u2019s a bad bet: Whether or not the U.S. participates in climate pacts like Paris, the climate is going to change, and no wall can keep rising temperatures, and their effects, out. But the U.S.-global relationship flows the other way, too: There are times when the world needs the U.S., and the effort to slow climate change is shaping up as one of those. Even discounting the effect of U.S. emissions on the goal of limiting change to 2 degrees Celsius, it\u2019s simply very hard for international agreements to function without the U.S. behaving as the enforcer. That makes Paris an interesting test case for whether global agreements can work with America withdrawing from the stage, and if so, whether anyone else can step up. \u201cThe absence of the U.S. at a political level is visible. I was at the Conference of Parties in Bonn in November and the absence of the U.S. is absolutely felt,\u201d Todd Stern, the Obama administration\u2019s lead negotiator on Paris, said Sunday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic . \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of countries trying to pull back and backslide and it wouldn\u2019t be happening the same way if the U.S. was there.\u201d The biggest risk of U.S. withdrawal hasn\u2019t come to fruition, Stern said: Other countries didn\u2019t pull out of the agreement after the U.S. did\u2014in fact, Syria joined in November, making the U.S. the only country in the world that is opposed. Stern worries that current levels of effort still aren\u2019t enough to make the 2 degree mark. \u201cIf the U.S. is not in there, the likelihood that you\u2019re going to get other countries doing their best is just reduced,\u201d he said. But despite the foot-dragging from some countries, the most important players are all working to reduce carbon emissions, even as the U.S. loosens restrictions domestically. \u201cChina is definitely pushing forward. India, definitely pushing forward. They\u2019re doing that domestically,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, former longtime executive secretary UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The motives behind that aren\u2019t always altruistic: China\u2019s leadership views clean technology as a huge economic growth opportunity. China is an emerging superpower, and pundits have long speculated that it could replace the U.S. as the dominant force in international agreements. So far, however, that isn\u2019t happening, Stern and Figueres said. They\u2019re making strides domestically, but can\u2019t seem to translate that into leadership among other countries. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for other countries to align their political message with what is going on on the ground,\u201d she said. There\u2019s an irony to this. For years, the rest of the world has often bridled at U.S. arrogance in foreign policy. Now, other countries are asking for the U.S. to assert its leadership at just the moment when the U.S. government is not only retrenching, as the Obama administration did, but withdrawing altogether. It turns out that while American power has sometimes bullied other countries into doing what they don\u2019t want, it\u2019s also a useful tool for forcing them to do the things they want to do but can\u2019t on their own. Climate change will be a test for Trump\u2019s isolationist vision and whether the world can find ways to work without the U.S acting as muscle. It\u2019s unfortunate that the experiment\u2019s stakes include the future of human life.","headline":"Can Anyone Fill the U.S. Leadership Vacuum on Climate Change?","article_name":563594.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2018\/06\/can-anyone-fill-the-us-leadership-vacuum-on-climate-change\/563594\/","date_published":"2018-06-25 09:00:00","article_length":3837,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:02.165882","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2018\/06\/can-anyone-fill-the-us-leadership-vacuum-on-climate-change\/563594\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Liberal Senate Democrats who are launching a new effort to seize the political offensive on climate change say they have enthusiastic backing from the chamber's Democratic leadership team. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse on Thursday announced a new Climate Action Task Force. Whitehouse told reporters at a briefing that\u00a0Majority Leader Harry Reid supports their efforts to raise the visibility of the topic. \"I think Harry Reid has really shifted to a more supportive and positive and enthusiastic strategy,\" the Rhode Island Democrat said. \"A lot of the things that we are doing involve getting his blessing, and we have that.\" Reid praised the new effort in a statement, citing a \"moral obligation\" to future generations to address climate change. \"I'm pleased that these and other Senators are coming together to bring greater attention to climate change and extreme weather and the need to do something about it,\" he said. Whitehouse also said that Sen. Chuck Schumer has agreed to have more climate-related speakers at the regular Thursday meetings of the Democratic Policy and Communications Center, a group the New York Democrat chairs. Al Gore spoke to the group late last year. Overall, Boxer said the new task force has more than a dozen members and is designed to \"wake up Congress to the disturbing realities of climate change.\" \"The purpose is to use the bully pulpit of our Senate offices to achieve that wake-up call,\" she said at the briefing. \"We believe that climate change is a catastrophe that is unfolding before our eyes, and we want Congress to take off the blindfolds.\" She and Whitehouse sketched out several activities the task force will undertake, which include press conferences; bringing more members to the floor to discuss climate change; stepped-up engagement with outside groups that work on the topic; defending against GOP legislation to thwart federal climate-change regulations; and promoting legislation on energy efficiency and alternative fuels. One overarching goal is to eventually force an opening for major climate legislation, which is currently in a deep freeze in Congress and lacks votes. Boxer and Whitehouse both want to eventually see passage of legislation that sets taxes or fees on carbon emissions. Whitehouse said there is a \"vast and broad array of armies\" that understand the danger of climate change and are willing to fight on the topic, but they're confronting a \"barricade of special-interest lies around Washington and around Congress.\" Whitehouse sees the task force as a way to create political space for putting a price on carbon emissions. \"Once that barricade is broken, all sorts of legislation becomes possible, because suddenly Congress has to get real,\" he said. Boxer and Whitehouse plan to hold a press conference with members of the task force on Tuesday. They also say they are engaged with the White House on climate efforts. The task force is one of several Democratic climate groups in Congress, including the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change that Whitehouse launched with Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., in early 2013.","headline":"Boxer and Whitehouse: Dem Leaders Back New Push on Climate Change ","article_name":447504.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/01\/boxer-and-whitehouse-dem-leaders-back-new-push-on-climate-change\/447504\/","date_published":"2014-01-09 14:26:11","article_length":3170,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:03.109929","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/01\/boxer-and-whitehouse-dem-leaders-back-new-push-on-climate-change\/447504\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The timescales of global warming This is \u2018Not Doomed Yet,\u2019 The Atlantic \u2019s weekly newsletter about global warming. It lives here in the science section; you can also get it in your inbox : Enter your email address powered by TinyLetter So, Paris happened. The last time I wrote, there was no international diplomatic framework for addressing climate change. Now there is. If I haven\u2019t sent anything to this list in a while, it\u2019s because I was covering the talks for a larger audience. You may be interested in the two stories that concluded that coverage: I\u2019d also recommend you read Michael Liebreich\u2019s reflections on COP21 at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But now it\u2019s a week or two out, and the euphoria has diminished. The Paris agreement inaugurates a new calendar for addressing climate change\u2014with rounds of talks in 2018, 2023, 2028, and beyond\u2014but for it to come to fruition, that calendar will depend on Democrats winning the White House next year and on climate working very differently as a U.S. political issue. In the medium term, it will also rely\u2014not to put too fine a point on it\u2014on the weakening of the global far right and on the maintenance of world order. This may all sound a little grandiose, but that kind of comes with the long-timescales and globally-organized-civilization thing. Of course, the other thing that comes with long timescales is time. So in these unseasonably warm days of expectation and rest at the end of the year, as Paris stops being news and becomes a political tool or obstacle, I\u2019ve been thinking back to a phrase that also occupied my mind as the talks began. It\u2019s my favorite Church idiom: \u201c ordinary time .\u201d As a proper term, ordinary time denotes the longest season of the liturgical year, which is, in fact, one season split into two parts. The first section of ordinary time spans from the end of Christmastide, in January, to the beginning of Lent, in February or March. Ordinary time resumes after Pentecost in the early summer, and then it lasts again until Advent, in November. Maybe it\u2019s my limited experience, living only a few places in the eastern half of North America, but to me that phrase, shorn of context\u2014 ordinary time \u2014captures what it\u2019s like to live under axial tilt, in the Earth\u2019s temperate latitudes, during the two seasons that start with a solstice. At the nadir of winter or zenith of summer, every week does seem ordinary. The nature of the world does not seem to vary from Wednesday to Wednesday: It stays hot and sunny or it stays cold and dark. But in the spring, the light and the weather one morning can vary wildly from the light and weather the next. The graph of sunrise and sunset times , after all, approximates a sine curve. To take it further from its Church meaning, \u201cordinary time\u201d not only communicates something like \u201cthe time when nothing particularly special is happening,\u201d but also emphasizes ordinal-ness: the time when we count up. And it\u2019s pleasant to count up. Counting up means the newspaper\u2019s \u201cBest Books of the Year\u201d feature comes out every December. It means making notches in the wall as kids get taller. It means normal politics still applies, and that not all your time needs to be devoted to the public good: You can still withdraw for a time, care for family and friends, preserve your home. It\u2019s not an original observation to say that climate change requires action during ordinary time, that if you wait for the crisis (whatever the \u201ccrisis\u201d is), it\u2019s too late. I saw a few writers compare COP21\u2014a conference \u201cto save the world\u201d\u2014to a last-ditch diplomatic meeting to stave off nuclear war. But that isn\u2019t quite it. If negotiators were preventing war, we\u2019d be out of ordinary time, in extraordinary crisis. Instead\u2014despite El Ni\u00f1o, despite the Chennai rains, despite the Indonesian fires and Ethiopian famine\u2014society continues, teetering between ordinary time, our semi-performative forever-crisis, and reckless emergency. The awfulness is that, despite the long and worrisome decades involved in discussing climate change, we only know the present. We don\u2019t know when we will slip out of ordinary time, and guessing about future historiography only serves contemporary politics. A friend remembered the \u201cFour Quartets\u201d: Time past and time future What might have been and what has been Point to one end, which is always present. And as the talks ended, I thought of a different snippet of verse, the closing monologue from Nixon in China. Chou En-Lai wonders what will come of diplomacy with the Americans: How much of what we did was good? Everything seems to move beyond our remedy. Come, heal this wound. At this hour nothing can be done. Just before dawn the birds begin, the warblers who prefer the dark, the cage-birds answering. To work! Outside this room the chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass. To work\u2014but please, this week, to rest. If you\u2019re looking for something to read before 2016, try Carrie Frye on the balloon explorers of the Arctic ; or Elizabeth Kolbert on the siege of Miami , which is self-recommending. And since this letter hasn\u2019t been crypto-spiritual enough, a final note: NASA released a \u201c new Earthrise \u201d last week, which I found unconvincing. (Among other oddities, the Sahara looks too green.) But I\u2019ve been reading lately about the first Earthrise photo, in Michael Poole\u2019s tremendous 2008 book , and learned of an episode I hadn\u2019t before heard. Forty-seven years ago, Apollo 8 broadcast from their final orbit of the moon. Hours before, they had glimpsed and photographed Earthrise for the first time. You can watch this broadcast on YouTube ; all of this is famous space history. But I was not familiar with William Styron\u2019s account of watching the transmission: It was an icy Connecticut evening in a house filled with noisy festivity. My host\u2014a teacher of renown whom I greatly esteem\u2014has a mind of generous curiosity and of eclectic concern, but is a man with a blind spot, at least at that time; he had found the space program a technocratic scam, overblown, financially extravagant, and basically a bore. As close as we always had been we rarely spoke of the astronauts and their flights. I had trouble that evening making him interrupt the party so that we could turn on the television set and follow the progress of the Apollo module as it began its circuit around the moon. Suddenly, there before us was that stark sphere, the craters, the jagged shadows that one knew to be chaotic mounds of rubble, the glistening white landscape projected against a backdrop of unfathomable darkness. The murmur and laughter of the party diminished and died, and we watched in silence while William Anders spoke the words from Genesis: In the beginning God created  the Heaven and the Earth,  And the Earth was without  form, and void\u2026 Ceremonial words tend to sound hollow and inappropriate, generally because they are predictable, touched by the stale hand of prearrangement. But these words, spoken at one of history\u2019s truly heroic ceremonials, seemed entirely appropriate, and I remember that a chill coursed down my back and an odd sigh went through the gathering like a tremor or a wind. Then how was it possible to be more deeply affected, to discover a pitch of eloquence more grand than those incantatory lines? Simple. Listen to Frank Borman, whose cheery valedictory brought home the reality, nearly lost in the sheer awesomeness of the occasion, that we were witnessing the exploits not of some crew of demigods or archangels, but of mortally fleshed men like those of us gathered around a winter\u2019s fire: \u201cGoodbye, good night. Merry Christmas. God bless all of you, all of you on the good earth.\u201d I glanced at my host, the mistrusting and scornful teacher, and saw on his face an emotion that was depthless and inexpressible.","headline":"My Favorite Story of the 'Earthrise' Photo","article_name":419061.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/climate-change-and-ordinary-time\/419061\/","date_published":"2015-12-22 20:37:14","article_length":7788,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:03.462242","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/climate-change-and-ordinary-time\/419061\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The most famous climate goal is woefully misunderstood. Sign up for The Weekly Planet, The Atlantic\u2019 s newsletter about living through climate change, here. How hot is too hot for planet Earth? For years, there\u2019s been a consensus in the climate movement: no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The figure comes from the Paris Agreement, a climate treaty ratified in 2016, and world leaders such as President Joe Biden bring it up all the time: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win this fight, every major emitter nation needs [to] align with the 1.5 degrees,\u201d he said in November. Youth activists at the Sunrise Movement call 1.5 degrees a \u201ccritical threshold.\u201d Even the corporate world is stuck on 1.5 degrees. Companies including Apple, Google, and Saudi Aramco\u2014the world\u2019s largest oil company\u2014claim to be transitioning their operations in alignment with the 1.5 goal. But here\u2019s the thing: 1.5 degrees, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, isn\u2019t based on any scientific calculation. It doesn\u2019t represent a specific planetary threshold or ecological tipping point. It was first proposed during international climate negotiations as a moral statement, a rebuke of the idea that the world could accept some disruption and suffering in order to burn fossil fuels just a bit longer. That\u2019s the takeaway of a new study on the history of the target from two French academics, B\u00e9atrice Cointe from the Centre for the Sociology of Innovation and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Guillemot from the Centre Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, both funded by the French National Centre for Scientific Research. From the perspective of the present, it\u2019s a relief that 1.5 degrees doesn\u2019t represent a scientific threshold, because we are almost certainly going to blow past it. As a rebuke, however, it may live on. Read: The 1.5-degree goal is all but dead Nothing about the 1.5-degree target was inevitable. For decades, the number on the lips of most climate negotiators was 2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. And you do still hear that number as the go-to target in some climate circles. But in the late 2000s, a negotiating bloc called the the Alliance of Small Island States argued that this was simply too much warming for their vulnerable nations. Their atolls would be overtopped by the sea; their coastal cities would flood. So they called for a lower target, and 1.5 seemed like a reasonable half-step down from 2 degrees. From there, 1.5 degrees gained momentum in diplomatic back channels and in conversations within think tanks, NGOs, and a group called the Climate Vulnerable Forum . But there was at that time very little science on the target; scientists were busy modeling higher levels of warming, which they considered more likely. A 2015 scientific panel hosted by the UN concluded that although the science on 1.5 was \u201cless robust,\u201d \u201cefforts should be made to\u201d set warming targets as low as possible. That year, after what Cointe and Guillemot characterize as \u201cintense and difficult negotiations,\u201d the new target was folded into the Paris Agreement, which calls for \u201cpursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.\u201d Science informs policy. But policy shapes science too. Most climate scientists thought staying under 1.5 degrees was unrealistic. But climate diplomats nevertheless asked the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for a special report on what the planet would look like with 1.5 degrees of warming. A report was duly delivered in 2018, and it unsurprisingly suggested that, all things considered, 1.5 degrees Celsius would be less bad than 2 degrees Celsius. Which, duh. More warming is always worse. Staying below 1.5 degrees, the IPCC scientists concluded, would be an extremely heavy lift that would require, among other things, slashing emissions about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030. This is the origin of the common idea that we have \u201c12 years left\u201d to stop climate change. The IPCC puts out lots of reports, but its report on 1.5 degrees remains its undisputed chart-topping banger. You can feel its influence in this speech that Greta Thunberg gave to the U.K.\u2019s houses of Parliament in 2019: \u201cAround the year 2030,\u201d she said, \u201c10 years 252 days and 10 hours away from now, we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilization as we know it.\u201d In 2023, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is a fantasy. It is not happening . We have already warmed the planet more than 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate scientists say we could pass 1.5 degrees Celsius within a decade. A December analysis by The  Washington Post suggested that ending the century under 1.5 degrees Celsius without substantial mid-century overshoot would require reforestation on a mind-boggling scale, plus massive deployment of machines to suck carbon out of the air and cache it underground\u2014technology that does not yet exist on a widespread scale\u2014along with a near-total abandonment of fossil fuels like five minutes ago. Read: We\u2019ve never seen a carbon-removal plan like this before That we\u2019re going to warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius is not good, of course. The IPCC\u2019s report on 1.5 degrees Celsius predicted more extreme heat, altered rain patterns, sea-level rise, increased wildfire, ocean acidification, and major hits to ecosystems such as arctic tundra and coral reefs as temperatures rise. But it is also probably not \u201c the end of our civilization as we know it .\u201d Waking up to 1.6 degrees Celsius won\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve crossed a threshold, because it isn\u2019t one. It will feel similar to the hot, disrupted world we already inhabit\u2014just worse. There are many possible futures inside the realistic range of warming possibilities; their contours depend not just on the level of warming as measured in degrees but on how we adapt. The legacy of 1.5 degrees is complicated. The target seems to have prompted many people, such as Thunberg, to start or join activist groups to press for change. Some activists framed 1.5 degrees as a terrifying precipice that we are driving toward at top speed, and to the extent that it has felt like a point of no return, it has caused a fair amount of eco-anxiety, which research shows can lead to paralysis and apathy\u2014the opposite of action. If people give up in despair when we cross the mark, the figure will have been counterproductive for the climate movement. For now, knowing whether it\u2019s done more harm or good to the cause is impossible. Either way, 1.5 degrees will likely soon cease to be a target and become a historical fact. But even then, the 1.5-degree target won\u2019t be entirely obsolete. It has another function\u2014governments that promised in the Paris Agreement to \u201cpursu[e] efforts\u201d to limit warming to 1.5 degrees can now be held accountable for breaking their promise. Enshrined in a legally binding treaty, 1.5 now represents what humanity should have accomplished. The target can be used as a basis for measuring the rich world\u2019s moral failures\u2014and justifying reparations (or \u201closs and damage,\u201d as they are now referred to in climate-diplomacy circles) to the rest of the world. Today, 1.5 degrees is less a feasible target than a \u201cdiplomatic weapon,\u201d Cointe and Guillemot write. It is also already being used in court to sue governments and force them to take more drastic measures to limit emissions. \u201cIn that sense, it has a use,\u201d Cointe told me. 1.5 degrees is just a number: a little better than 1.6 degrees, a little worse than 1.4 degrees. But as a reference against which humanity\u2019s failures can be judged, it will remain powerful.","headline":"1.5 Degrees Was Never the End of the World","article_name":672909.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2023\/02\/climate-change-paris-agreement-15-degrees-celsius-goal\/672909\/","date_published":"2023-02-01 12:30:00","article_length":7748,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:04.008343","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2023\/02\/climate-change-paris-agreement-15-degrees-celsius-goal\/672909\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Air quality in Beijing has a lot to do with snowstorms in Siberia. When smog gets bad, the air becomes more than a coolness on your skin or a haze on the horizon. When smog gets bad, you can taste it. \u201cToday, Shanghai air really has a layered taste. At first, it tastes slightly astringent with some smokiness. Upon full contact with your palate, the aftertaste has some earthy bitterness, and upon careful distinguishing you can even feel some dust-like particulate matter,\u201d Alan Yu, a gourmet chef who lives in Shanghai, told The Telegraph  in 2013 . Yu got to know those tastes pretty well. In January of that year , a Greenland-sized cloud of toxic air pollution smothered the plains of eastern China, shrouding the skylines of China\u2019s largest cities in a sickly gray-yellow fog. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing reported that levels of PM 2.5\u2014a type of particulate air pollution that seeps into lung, vein, and heart tissue\u2014surged above 850 micrograms per cubic meter; the UN says that 20 micrograms per cubic meter is the highest safe level. Schools, highways, and airports closed. More than 7,000 children were sent to Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital on a single day. At least 50 of the country\u2019s 74 major cities exceeded national air-quality standards. The episode remains the worst haze pollution ever recorded in the month of January. Something was strange about the smog. Usually smog will dissipate when sources of air pollution\u2014like cars or factories\u2014shut down for a time. But this cloud was stubborn. As part of solar new year celebrations in February 2013, millions of families drove their cars out of Beijing to go on vacation, and the government ordered all factories to cease operations. The smog didn\u2019t subside much, and less than a week later the full-on \u201cairpocalypse\u201d returned as bad as before. What made the winter smog so bad that year\u2014and in the winters since, which have also been stubbornly smoggy? Two new studies revisit the episode. Both of them argue that climate change will make this kind of smog event much more common. And, remarkably, one of them asserts that the Chinese smog of January 2013 was worsened by two weather phenomena thousands of miles away. Because the Arctic Ocean froze less than it usually does, and because higher-than-usual snowdrifts piled up across the boreal forests of Russia, millions of Chinese people were subjected to some of the worst air pollution ever measured. That\u2019s because the smog of January 2013 wasn\u2019t the result of emissions alone: Weather played the accomplice. For most of that winter, air over eastern China barely circulated. Trade winds went dormant, so smog could not ventilate to the east; and vertical circulation slowed, meaning particulate matter could not float up into the higher atmosphere. And as is typical for Chinese winters, rain never arrived to wash air pollution out. The first paper , published Monday in Nature Climate Change, uses an ensemble of 15 climate models to suggest that those wind conditions\u2014which lead to a stagnation of air across China\u2019s most populated regions\u2014are more likely to occur in the century to come. The haze-inducing conditions are 50 percent more likely to form between 2050 and 2099 than they were from 1950 to 1999. And once those patterns fall into place in any one episode, they are 80 percent more likely to persist. These calculations assumed a worst-case emissions scenario, so any reduction in projected carbon-dioxide emissions (to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, for instance) would likely reduce the frequency and persistence of haze episodes. A second paper goes further . A team at Georgia Tech asked: What in the world, specifically, shaped those wind patterns? They applied a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence to historical climate and pollution data. Ultimately, they found two big influences: the extent that the Arctic Ocean has frozen over, and the amount of Siberia and the Russian far east covered in snow. These shape the climate of China mostly through their differing temperatures. And when the Arctic is especially warm, and Siberia is covered with snow and especially cold, they combine to reduce the atmospheric-pressure gradient across Asia. This weakens the pull of the East Asian monsoon wind and leaves air stagnating across eastern China. \u201cIn our analysis, these two effects have a similar impact. And if you put them together, you have a bigger impact,\u201d said Yuhang Wang, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Georgia Tech. These two weather events seem to be getting more common, and more intense, as the climate keeps warming. This means that even as China succeeds in reducing some of its emissions, the winter haze may worsen for meteorological reasons. Really, this is what\u2019s already happening: Even in January 2013, there was no reported massive surge in factory emissions. The sudden build-up of smog was all meteorology. \u201cI see this as an offsetting effect,\u201d Wang told me. \u201cPolar, high-Arctic changes are offsetting the effort that China has been putting into emissions reductions.\u201d Noelle Selin, a professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the paper was important because it showed how local weather could shape global air pollution. \u201cIt\u2019s a real different approach than has been traditionally taken,\u201d she told me. Most smog research uses an atmospheric-chemistry model and not a model of the planet\u2019s entire climate system. \u201cAnd I think we definitely need both approaches.\u201d She added that she had pondered whether sea ice or Eurasian snow were shaping air-pollution patterns in the United States or Europe. \u201cBeing able to quantitatively test [that effect] is a really unique contribution of this paper,\u201d she said. Though there\u2019s been research into how climate affects air pollution, it mostly focuses on the more developed parts of the world. Wang\u2019s team at Georgia Tech, for instance, has found that dry, warm, autumnal air in the American southeast is leading to record-breaking ozone pollution in the region, even though industrial emissions levels are down. Fewer studies have focused on China because its contemporary air-pollution problem is so dire. But studies like this help reveal why addressing air pollution and climate change are twin political priorities for Beijing. If air pollution is a political problem today, imagine how bad it could be when climate change intensifies it. And President Xi also has a near-term reason to figure out winter pollution: Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022. Speaking of low Arctic ice and smog over Beijing, Selin said she could think of few other atmospheric phenomena where such distant events were so closely correlated. The best examples, she said, were the periodic temperature swings in the oceans, like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a . Yet the fact of this world is that there is always a vast and planetary dance, where silent icebergs in a cold, dark sea shape the pollution that skips across an urbane chef\u2019s tongue.","headline":"How Climate Change Covered China in Smog","article_name":520197.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/03\/how-climate-change-covered-china-in-smog\/520197\/","date_published":"2017-03-21 17:13:51","article_length":7005,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:04.299106","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/03\/how-climate-change-covered-china-in-smog\/520197\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Again. Election Day 2012 was an important day for Donald Trump. It may have been important for the planet, too. As Americans across the country traveled to the polls to select their next president, Trump tweeted 46 times. He endorsed Mitt Romney. He congratulated himself for The Apprentice \u2019s high ratings. He asked whether Americans wanted a president \u201cwho bows to the Saudis.\u201d And he advanced a claim that followed him around for years: that human-caused climate change was a hoax invented by a foreign government. \u201cThe concept of global warming,\u201d he tweeted , \u201cwas created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d Over the next few years, he dubbed climate change a \u201c hoax, \u201d \u201c a total hoax ,\u201d \u201c an expensive hoax ,\u201d and \u201c a total, and very expensive, hoax .\u201d He also called it \u201c very expensive \u2026 bullshit .\u201d Election days have come and gone, and another one draws near. And Trump, now president of the United States, has been called to account for that view. On Sunday evening, in a lengthy interview on 60 Minutes , President Trump clarified that he no longer believes climate change is a hoax. \u201cI think something\u2019s happening,\u201d he told the journalist Lesley Stahl. \u201cSomething\u2019s changing, and it\u2019ll change back again. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hoax. I think there\u2019s probably a difference, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s man-made. \u201cI will say this,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don\u2019t wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I don\u2019t wanna be put at a disadvantage.\u201d Read: Trump has done more than pull out of the Paris Agreement Trump\u2019s answer contains some new claims\u2014but in many ways, it\u2019s classic Trump, weaving together some of his most common environmental themes. There\u2019s a sense of grievance: the idea that even if climate change isn\u2019t a hoax, its only role is to cost people money and harm American industry. There are mangled facts: Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, for instance, all evidence suggests that climate change is man-made. As one of NASA \u2019s lead climate scientists happened to tweet Sunday afternoon , \u201call\u201d of the \u201crecent trends in climate are due to human activity.\u201d And there\u2019s the most important element of all: The president really doesn\u2019t seem to have any clear views on climate change. Trump has overseen one of the most consequential overhauls of U.S. climate policy: leaving the Paris Agreement , slashing rules against coal pollution , rolling back fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks . Yet he doesn\u2019t have any opinions about climate change other than a base-level skepticism of it. This lets Trump regularly shift his claims based on whom he\u2019s talking to. When addressing his base, for instance, he implies that climate change doesn\u2019t exist in the most trollish ways possible. In a tweet last December, amid a frigid cold snap on the East Coast, he joked, \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against.\u201d Read: The president doesn\u2019t care to understand global warming. But when talking face-to-face with people who accept climate change, he\u2019s more equivocal. In late November 2016, he told editors and executives at The New York Times , \u201cI think there is some connectivity\u201d between human activity and climate change. When Thomas Friedman, a writer for the Times \u2019 op-ed page, said that climate change was \u201cvery near and dear to my heart,\u201d Trump replied that he would keep an open mind on the issue. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely, Tom,\u201d he said. The same dynamic played out on Sunday, as Trump struggled to come off as thoughtful in response to Stahl\u2019s implacable, and mostly excellent, questioning. \u201cI wish you could go to Greenland ,\u201d she told the president, \u201cwatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.\u201d \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump replied. That just isn\u2019t true, and Stahl said so, replying that \u201cyour scientists\u201d at NOAA and NASA have shown ice loss at the poles is driven by warming temperatures . \u201cWe have scientists that disagree with that,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI\u2019m not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we\u2019re talking about over millions of years\u2014\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s denying it,\u201d said Stahl. The two then went back and forth on whether storms such as Hurricane Michael have gotten worse because of climate change\u2014the answer is yes, but it\u2019s complicated \u2014before Trump implied that he couldn\u2019t trust scientists because \u201cthey have a very big political agenda, Lesley.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, has allowed his own political agenda to blind him to the facts. Last year, researchers at a staggering array of U.S. federal institutions\u2014including NASA , the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Naval Postgraduate School\u2014 published the Climate Science Special Report at Congress\u2019s behest. They surveyed the best-available climate science and reached a number of conclusions  that would evidently shock the president , including that \u201chuman activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d Trump should read it.","headline":"Trump Slightly Revises His Views on Climate Change","article_name":573037.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/trumps-always-shifting-views-on-climate-change\/573037\/","date_published":"2018-10-16 10:30:00","article_length":5277,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:05.120179","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/trumps-always-shifting-views-on-climate-change\/573037\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"This summer\u2019s weather has forced a kind of continuous awareness of climate change. \u00a0 Every week, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . In retrospect, last week was an interlude. Hurricane Ida had made landfall in Louisiana as a violent Category 4 storm over the weekend, displacing thousands and killing more than a dozen people , but a certain kind of worst-case scenario had been avoided: New Orleans\u2019s levees and pumps had held, thank goodness. The city\u2019s electricity system did not, alas, and some of its suburbs succumbed to the waters\u2014but the city\u2019s decision not to evacuate had been vindicated . But then on Wednesday night, Ida\u2019s remnants rolled into the Northeast, drenching the most densely populated part of the country with record-breaking amounts of rain. At least 52 people have died in the region. In many cases, the victims died because water fell from the sky faster than any infrastructure could dispose of it. A 46-year-old mother in Bridgewater, New Jersey, was swept away by floodwaters on a major highway while trying to escape her SUV; a three-person Nepali family drowned in their basement apartment in Queens. And this is just a sample. One of Philadelphia\u2019s biggest highways turned into a canal . Seven tornadoes touched down as Ida blew through, leveling homes and farms. Some parts of central New Jersey received more than nine inches of rain , at a rate of more than two inches an hour. I should know: I spent part of the holiday weekend helping my parents, who live in that area, move waterlogged boxes, clothes, and paper out of their deluged basement. For all the drama of climate change, dealing with its impacts is mostly drudgery. I\u2019ve been a climate-change reporter for nearly half a decade, so I can remember all the previous news cycles\u2014the storms, the wildfires, the heat waves\u2014in which we journalists insisted that climate change had arrived. The truth is that climate change has been arriving for 30 years, and it will keep intensifying until we do something about it. Yet something does seem different about this Northern Hemisphere summer, like the ever-worsening weather has forced a kind of continual climate awareness. In California, nearly as many acres have burned so far this  year as burned in the entire annus horribilis  of 2018 . The Pacific Northwest roasted under its most scorching temperatures ever; swaths of the American West suffered a now-normal fire-and-smoke season for weeks on end. In Europe, the Mediterranean suffered through its own blistering heat wave , then exploded in record-breaking wildfires . And in China, 302 people died when enormous rainstorms flooded streets and a subway tunnel in Henan province; two weeks later, another 21 people died in a different flooding event to the south. There\u2019s some statistical backup for this feeling, at least here in the United States. Nearly a third of Americans live in an area where a federal disaster\u00a0 occurred this summer, according to a new Washington Post analysis , and at leas 64 percent of Americans suffered through a multiday heat wave this year. Since June, more than 380 Americans have died in some kind of extreme weather event. I do not know exactly what to say about this depressing statistic, but I have two thoughts that might help serve as a starting place. A few weeks ago, a reader emailed me to say that a friend of theirs was using my reporting to justify their own doomerism \u2014the idea that the climate is so broken that we are powerless to stop it, that we should just ignore it and enjoy our lives. This is, I believe, a very naive point of view. Climate change is more like a debt than a terminal diagnosis. If we ignore it today, we (or our descendants) will only have more work to do in the future. Besides, if we do find a way to address it, then we will have found a way to make human prosperity compatible with a thriving biosphere. Because it is Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, I am thinking of the teaching of the first-century rabbi Tarfon: \u201cIt is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it.\u201d We should take comfort in the fact that New Orleans\u2019s levees, floodgates, and flood walls\u2014 constructed at a cost of $14 billion by the federal government\u2014 held. That is, it is possible  to protect people against the nightmarish atmosphere, but it will require billions of dollars of investment and retrenchment. In the next few weeks, Congress will decide whether to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s $3.5 trillion infrastructure package, which would become the most significant American climate mitigation and adaptation law ever passed . It concerns me that Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said that that bill might be too large. In such an emergency, it is far too small. Think about how much climate change has intensified in the past five years. And then think about how much it will intensify in the next five years, and what happens if we have no levees to protect us.","headline":"When the Climate Crisis Becomes Unignorable","article_name":620004.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/09\/summer-climate-disaster\/620004\/","date_published":"2021-09-07 20:27:39","article_length":5158,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:05.460937","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/09\/summer-climate-disaster\/620004\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"For the first time in years, a broad spectrum of climate advocates is playing offense. Suddenly, climate change is a high-profile national issue again. It\u2019s not just the Green New Deal. Around the country, the loose alliance of politicians, activists, and organizations concerned about climate change is mobilizing. They are deploying a new set of strategies aimed at changing the minds\u2014or at least the behaviors\u2014of a large swath of Americans, including utility managers, school principals, political donors, and rank-and-file voters. They make a ragtag group: United by little more than common concern, they don\u2019t agree on an ideal federal policy or even how to talk about the problem. They do not always coordinate or communicate with one another. And while their efforts are real, it remains far too early to say whether they will result in the kind of national legislative victories that have eluded the movement in the past. But for the first time since November 8, 2016, if not far earlier, climate advocates are once again playing offense. This mobilization starts at the top of the U.S. political system. Earlier this month, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee announced that he would run for president to elevate climate change as a pressing national issue. Inslee\u2019s launch did not mention his White House\u2013ready biography\u2014he\u2019s a former star athlete who married his high-school sweetheart\u2014and focused entirely on his decades-long climate focus. \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation\u2019s number-one priority,\u201d Inslee said in his launch video. His campaign raised $1 million in its first three days, a surprisingly large figure for a single-issue underdog candidate. Read: Jay Inslee\u2019s risky bet for 2020 Other national political leaders are trying different strategies. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has made climate a signature issue, announced that he would not run for president because his considerable fortune would be better spent fighting carbon pollution directly. Instead, he will fund a new campaign called Beyond Carbon for the Sierra Club , an extension of the club\u2019s wildly successful Beyond Coal campaign , also bankrolled by Bloomberg. Beyond Coal says it has helped close 285 of the country\u2019s 530 coal plants, a major reason for the overall decline in U.S. carbon emissions. This widespread public concern about climate change is already being reflected in policy made at the state level. New Mexico will soon become the third state to set a goal for 100 percent carbon-free electricity . Last week, lawmakers passed a mandate that by 2045, 80 percent of the state\u2019s power must come from renewable sources and 20 percent from carbon-free sources. The governor cheered the measure and is expected to sign it. California, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia have adopted similar goals, all pegged to 2045. And their ranks could soon expand. Twelve more Democratic governors have promised to mandate the same 100 percent target, according to Rob Sargent , a campaign director at Environment America, a consortium of state-level environmental groups. \u201cSix governors got elected in November running on 100 percent renewables,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have happened four or even two years ago.\u201d Excitement is also coming from the grassroots. On Friday, thousands of U.S. students refused to go to school , participating in a worldwide student strike for climate action. The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led group that brought national attention to the Green New Deal in November , plans to hold 100 town-hall meetings in support of the plan across the country , organized by local chapters. Much of this activity is concentrated among Democrats. But public opinion has shifted in their favor on the issue. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that the Republican Party\u2019s position on climate change is \u201coutside the mainstream,\u201d according to an NBC\/ Wall Street Journal poll conducted last month. That represents a nine-point bump since October 2015, when the question was last asked. That poll was conducted in February, when the Democratic-led Green New Deal dominated media coverage. But a majority of Americans said that month that Democratic positions on climate change were \u201cin the mainstream.\u201d Within the party, rank-and-file Democrats seem to be taking the issue more seriously. Eighty percent of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers say that primary candidates should talk \u201ca lot\u201d about climate change\u2014a result that suggests climate change is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s top two issues, according to a CNN\/ Des Moines Register poll conducted by Selzer and Company this month. Only health care merited such consensus concern among the group. That points to a potential upheaval in how important voters consider climate policy. In May 2015, when the same polling firm last posed a similar question to likely Democratic caucus-goers, climate change did not rank among the top five most important issues . And several recent polls have also identified a huge, nearly 10-point surge in worry about climate change among all Americans. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like that in the 10 years we\u2019ve been conducting the study,\u201d Anthony Leiserowitz , a researcher at Yale, told me in January. Those national surveys found that Americans were motivated by a series of urgent new reports about climate science and an outbreak of extreme weather. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report Some Republicans say they\u2019re taking notice. \u201cI think we\u2019re moving from the science of climate to the solutions of addressing climate, and that is a big shift in particular for Republicans,\u201d says Heather Reams , the executive director of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that encourages GOP politicians to support renewable energy. This shift , if it is occurring, has yet to result in concrete policy proposals. Nor is it shared across the party. Some Senate Republicans have embraced \u201cinnovation\u201d as a possible solution to climate change , but the Trump administration last week proposed zeroing out the budget for two major Department of Energy innovation programs. The programs will survive, however, in part because they have the support of Lamar Alexander, a powerful Republican from Tennessee who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. In the House, Republicans are far more skeptical of climate action. Representative Rob Bishop, a conservative lawmaker from Utah, has said the Green New Deal is nearly \u201ctantamount to genocide.\u201d The House GOP has offered very few climate policies of its own. An exception: Two Republicans\u2014Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Representative Francis Rooney of Florida\u2014last year co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to tax carbon emissions without increasing the federal budget. It\u2019s still unclear whether the spike in public concern will translate to any lasting GOP shift. The Green New Deal, in all its ambition and haziness, has reframed the climate conversation around solutions , where Democrats have more to say right now; if moderate Democrats fell back to insisting on the acceptance of climate science alone, Republicans might be happy to  meet them there. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change In any case, the views of the country\u2019s most powerful Republican, President Donald Trump, seem extremely unlikely to change . So it\u2019s left to his would-be 2020 opponents to heighten the contrast. At least eight candidates have made climate change a top issue, according to The New York Times . And announcing his candidacy for president last week, the former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas said that \u201cinterconnected crises in our economy, our democracy, and our climate have never been greater.\u201d (He has yet to offer a concrete proposal on the issue.) Whether this focus on climate change produces new policy ideas remains to be seen. Yet even so, environmental groups and their allies are feeling whiplash at how far the conversation has come since 2016. Says Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute , an environmental research center based in Oakland: \u201cIf you had asked me a year ago if we would\u2019ve been talking this much about climate change now, I would\u2019ve said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019\u201d","headline":"America Cares About Climate Change Again","article_name":585196.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/suddenly-climate-change-advocates-are-march\/585196\/","date_published":"2019-03-19 12:00:00","article_length":8318,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:05.915995","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/suddenly-climate-change-advocates-are-march\/585196\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"By modeling climate change's local effects, we may finally be able to grasp what it means. Earlier this year, the journal Nature Climate Change published a paper that measures hurricane behavior in our warming world. The study was as innovative as it was prescient. Combining models to simulate thousands of hurricanes in likely future climates, the authors discovered that New York City, their test case, was at risk. And increasingly so. The city's most severe storm flooding events historically have been quite rare. According to the paper, hurricane storm surge -- roiling coastal waters driven inland which are\u00a0 responsible for most of the devastation and destruction during storms -- can, in New York City, reach the exceptional height of about six feet once every century, and 10 feet once every 500 years. But as the Earth warms and sea levels rise, the study found, over the next few generations these extreme swells could batter New York Harbor as often as once every 3 years and 25 years, respectively. That was in February. Then, on the night of October 29, Hurricane Sandy drove a 14-foot wall of seawater deep into Brooklyn and lower Manhattan, flooding seven subway tunnels and shorting most circuits below Midtown. It eclipsed the city's previous storm surge record, set in the early 19th\u00a0century, by nearly three feet, leaving many New Yorkers paralyzed, wet, and in the dark. \"This is not just coincidence,\" Ning Lin, the paper's lead author and assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University, told me. \"We knew that New York City was vulnerable.\" At the spout of a funnel formed by Long Island and the New Jersey Shore, the so-called New York Bight renders lower Manhattan a basin for water with no place else to go. A stunted bulkhead, not quite five feet above mean sea level, does little to safeguard the low-lying coast. (Even with all of these threats, the city only ranks eighth\u00a0on a\u00a0 list of U.S. areas most vulnerable to hurricanes.) \"Already, a bad storm today is way beyond our ability to deal with effectively,\" Michael Oppenheimer, one of Lin's co-authors and a professor of geosciences and international affairs, also at Princeton, told me. \"So what does that say about a bad storm -- and the much worse risks we face -- years from now?\" Years from now, though, is in fact when these findings may be confirmed. Only a string of Sandys could verify such a study, which forecasts trends, not any specific hurricane which might define them. (That Sandy was a hybrid of hurricane and mid-latitude storm, formed under an unlikely confluence of climatic events, puts it somewhat outside the study's scope, too.) The temptation to view Sandy, or any major storm, as having been foretold by climate scientists, must be resisted. Capturing the effect of climate change on such high-impact weather is, in any case, not about predicting storms, but assessing risk -- the likelihood that, as burning fossil fuels continue to change the Earth's climate, these storms could strike more frequently and more violently. The business of climate science is probability, and rightfully so, because once predictions come to pass, it's too late . Lin appreciates why this may be difficult to grasp. \"Most people think because we had Irene last year, and now Sandy this year, it's because of climate change,\" she said. \"They think risk is increasing only when they see storms. And then after a few years, they forget.\" According to recent research in climate psychology, cognitive deficiencies may be numbing us to the urgency of such intangible, global threats. Complex dynamics like those at play in climate change -- worsening gradually and posing consequences mostly in the distant future -- are not easily factored in to our present deliberations. As a result, we hold out for the singular maelstrom to sound the alarm, which, in this case, is like waiting for the straw man: Its occurrence wouldn't wholly reflect the phenomenon we're looking for, and so its absence shouldn't be seen as indicative that the models are wrong. But climate psychologists also find that this simple-mindedness is not entirely our fault. It depends on how the questions are framed -- how a reader's mind is \"primed\" by certain events or exercises, before approaching the issue. And one way to frame climate change is to model the science. We may find that how climate scientists study the planet today, applying innovative techniques to quantify local risk, is more palpable than the diffuse issues we couldn't quite grasp. Anthropogenic global warming is, admittedly, an abstract phenomenon. It does not create individual hurricanes, but instead, more diffusely, ratchets up their threat. As the atmosphere warms it retains more moisture which, carried to landfall, can then be hurled ashore in heavier wind and rain. And according to one accepted theory, the so-called \"heat-engine\" hypothesis first suggested by Kerry Emanuel, another of Lin's co-authors and a professor of atmospheric science at MIT, the warmest water in more than half a century could be amplifying storms' power source. \"That's a good starting point for understanding how climate change might affect future hurricanes,\" James Elsner, a professor of geography at Florida State University, told me. His 2008 study of ocean temperature and hurricane strength was consistent with this idea. \"But just because stronger storms are getting stronger doesn't mean we're getting more storms.\" The latest climate models appear to be reaching agreement on this issue. Christopher Landsea, the science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, in Miami, is a leading expert on hurricane forecasting. In an opinion piece for the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, he aggregates recent studies on hurricanes and global warming. \"Hurricanes have been depicted as the literal poster-child of the harmful impacts of global warming,\" he begins, before confessing that \"manmade global warming has indeed caused hurricanes to be stronger today.\" But going forward, he's just not sure it will be significant. \"Simply linking hurricanes to global warming is not sufficient,\" he writes. We need to know by how much, and in that respect, the science appears relatively unthreatening: By the end of the century, tropical storms and hurricanes may grow stronger as the Earth warms, but only slightly, and may occur just as frequently, or even less so. \"[T]he overall impact of global warming on hurricanes is currently negligible and likely to remain quite tiny even a century from now,\" he concludes. Whatever a warming basin's brew cooks up, it isn't necessarily being felt . While storm frequency and climatology generally speaking don't appear to be amplified by rising seas and warming waters, the effect on storm behavior at landfall is another question. To Landsea, it may be among the most important. \"The biggest immediate worry I have,\" he concludes, \"is with the huge population increases of vulnerable coastal communities...causing massive damage increases and, unfortunately, large losses of life.\" It was for similar reasons that Emanuel, in 2006, first proposed conducting regional risk assessments by simulating hurricanes in various climate conditions. Historical records of hurricanes had yielded scarce data for many locales, and if the climate continued to change, they wouldn't offer much indication of future storms, either. By running simulations, he could render those future storms in physical models -- built from numerical values assigned to the different mechanisms at play -- to predict the likely effects of climate change on storms in a given region. Now, this year's study of surge in New York City by Lin and her team is the culmination of these efforts. \"The paper got a lot of response from people thinking it was very important and a new approach,\" Lin recalled. \"It got a lot of interest. So I think this is the direction to go.\" Greg Holland, director of the Earth System Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, seems to agree. \"Up until recently, the big focus has been on global climate change, like warming,\" he told me. \"As far as I'm concerned, that's now past science. We're coming down to regional scale.\" The approach is advancing, he explained, as \"we're able to take advantage of rapidly developing computing capacity.\" But, \"there are also some clever techniques.\" Lin's study, he thought, combined both. Using projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, future climatic conditions were set on a lattice, capturing the end of the 21st\u00a0century: Earth is roughly three degrees Centigrade warmer, oceans are about three feet higher, and amid an atmosphere thickening with carbon dioxide, new wind and rain patterns are emerging. Then, one by one, 45,000 proto-hurricanes -- sudden disturbances to air pressure over the Atlantic -- were virtually plunked down. \"Most die, according to a kind of natural selection of the fittest,\" Emanuel told me, referring to the realistic interaction between storms and their environment in the simulations. \"But some turn into bona fide hurricanes.\" Monitoring those that churned toward New York City, the researchers witnessed surges more severe than any in the city's history. While offering no indication of when a particular storm might strike, the findings describe a clear trend: The most extreme storm surges will penetrate the city more frequently as the climate changes. Storms like Sandy, then, may be only part of a larger threat -- from the worst inundations, like those still plaguing New Yorkers weeks after Sandy -- even if storms in general don't much change. Over the past century, the warming Atlantic Ocean has risen eight inches from thermal expansion and melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets. And even as the rates pick up -- to between one and three feet every century -- coastline along the Atlantic is sinking, worrisome for many of the 3.7 million Americans already at risk from flooding. Suppose, as most climate scientists do, that each additional foot of sea-level rise, along an East Coast beach with average slope, swallows 100 feet horizontally of land. \"Now think about a roughly similar effect with storm surge,\" Oppenheimer said. \"The water drives farther inland than it would have otherwise.\" While the issue of storm intensity allows wiggle room for debate, that of sea-level rise does not: The 28-foot surge during Katrina in 2005, a mere category 3 hurricane, was the highest ever recorded in the U.S., costing over $100 billion in damages and about 2,000 lives. The way Oppenheimer sees it, \"the risk is very high already. We're not very good at dealing with it. And the risk will get higher continuously until we reduce emissions, and slow global warming. So we better get cracking.\" The cost of waiting -- as high as $50 billion for Sandy, and potentially $1.8 trillion annually for high-impact weather in the coming decades -- has not been missed by the Mayor's office, which has since approached Lin and her team for help redesigning New York City's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Their method, though, can and will be applied elsewhere -- to Tampa, China, the Persian Gulf. Until then, according to Oppenheimer, \"We need to stay abreast of the scientific developments. And start defending ourselves.\" Unless, of course, we're willing to assume the risk.","headline":"In All Probability: Climate Change and the Risk of More Storms Like Sandy","article_name":265402.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/11\/in-all-probability-climate-change-and-the-risk-of-more-storms-like-sandy\/265402\/","date_published":"2012-11-19 20:36:34","article_length":11421,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:06.640121","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/11\/in-all-probability-climate-change-and-the-risk-of-more-storms-like-sandy\/265402\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Democrats are trying to do their prep work now so they can hit the ground running if they win a majority in 2021. It will be almost another 18 months until Democrats can even think of passing climate legislation. In the 2020 election, they must defeat President Donald Trump, reclaim the Senate, and retain a majority in the House of Representatives. And then they have to find something to pass before members of Congress start getting cold feet about the 2022 election. Even in a best-case scenario, the moment will be a nerve-racking, high-stakes one for climate advocates. So Senate Democrats are trying to front-load as much of that work as possible. Ten of them have formed the Senate Democrats\u2019 Special Committee on the Climate Crisis . Chaired by Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the committee aims to get as much of the preliminary work out of the way as possible\u2014the research and investigating and coalition-building\u2014so that Democrats can start passing climate legislation as soon as they regain the upper chamber. \u201cThe goal is to lay down the factual basis for taking action, so that if we are in charge in 2021, we don\u2019t have to go through 18 months of investigatory hearings,\u201d Schatz told me during a wide-ranging interview in his office last month. The committee will hold its first public hearing next Wednesday, when it will host mayors from five major cities, including St. Paul and Pittsburgh, that have set or already met ambitious climate goals. (Both of those cities specifically aim to cut  their carbon emissions 80 percent or more by 2050.) * Last month, Schatz and other committee members met with electric-utility executives behind closed doors. Schatz\u2019s near-term goal, beyond elevating climate policy into headlines, is to lay out the menu of climate-policy options. He also hopes the committee will describe, in confidently political language, what climate change is already doing across the United States. To that end, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a committee member and an Iraq War veteran, will lead a hearing on climate and national security. (\u201cI fought one war for foreign oil. Let\u2019s not do that again,\u201d Duckworth said when the group launched.) And Senators Tina Smith of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin might look into how climate change is hurting farmers. Read: On climate, Democrats now have a plan to make a plan The point, Schatz said, is to push climate change beyond just \u201cthe electrical-generation folks and the birds-and-butterflies advocates.\u201d \u201cPart of what we\u2019re trying to do is diversify the kind of politician that concerns themselves with climate, beyond your typical coastal, liberal male,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I say that as a coastal, liberal male.\u201d Schatz was not in the Senate when the upper chamber last considered serious climate legislation. In 2009, Barack Obama entered the White House promising to take action on two issues: climate change and health care. The president sometimes ranked global-warming policy over altering the health-insurance system. \u201cEnergy we have to deal with today,\u201d Obama said in a 2008 debate with John McCain, according to The New Yorker . \u201c Health care is priority Number Two.\u201d Once in office, Obama asked Congress to pursue the two issues at the same time. The result of that gamble has shaped American politics since: After an agonizing 13-month drafting process, the Democratic-controlled Congress coughed up the Affordable Care Act, and Obama signed it in March 2010. But a few months later, and after an even lengthier process, the Senate dropped any attempt at passing significant climate legislation. That fall, Democrats lost their majority in the House; they would not recapture the chamber until 2018. Schatz entered the Senate in 2012. He soon established himself as one of the caucus\u2019s most forceful climate advocates. In 2014, when Democrats held an all-night Senate session to demand climate legislation, Schatz spoke for five of the nearly 15 hours. (\u201cHe brought Hawaiian Kona coffee and macadamia-nut chocolates to help fuel his colleagues\u2019 overnight slog,\u201d The New York Times reported .) He also represents Hawaii, which aims to go completely carbon-neutral by 2045 , one of the strictest state-level climate goals in the country. The Senate is an inauspicious place for a climate advocate. Over the past three decades, it has proved adept at murdering climate policy. It didn\u2019t just kill a 2009 bill, which passed the House , and which would have let companies buy and sell the right to emit carbon pollution. In 1994, President Bill Clinton pushed for a revenue-raising energy tax that would have also reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. It, too, passed the House and died in the Senate . Schatz\u2019s political judgment is shaped by this history. When assessing presidential candidates on climate, he said, he tries to look past policy proposals and focus more on how candidates talk and think about the issue. \u201cI think everyone running is going to [range] from good-enough to excellent, in terms of what they\u2019re officially for,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real question is, should they become president, will they move, and move aggressively? Or will [climate] be the fourth issue they get to in the third year?\u201d Read: Democrats still don\u2019t know how to talk about climate change Above all, he hoped to understand why candidates cared about climate change. \u201cThat would give me some insight into whether or not, when push comes to shove, and there\u2019s a need to prioritize among competing issues, whether they\u2019re going to put climate action at the top of their list,\u201d he said. For now, his sense of what form a future climate bill might take is mostly broad strokes. Any Democratic-led climate effort must simultaneously strengthen labor unions, he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t do this and say some pablum about a just transition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s offensive, honestly. If you work in power generation, or pipeline laying, or electricity transmission, you want to know, how is this going to impact your ability to provide for your family?\u201d His first phone call after taking over the special committee was to Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO. Other ideas are still taking shape. Along with several other Democrats, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, he has co-sponsored a bill to tax carbon pollution. The type of policy that\u2019s emerged from the committee so far is more nuts-and-bolts than a total transformation of the economy. So far, power-utility executives are most interested in federal incentives for battery storage, he said. The committee will encourage more federal financial regulators to push companies to disclose their climate risk, whether from stranded assets or extreme weather. The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission recently voted to assess climate-related risk. Eventually, it could force companies to calculate how rising seas, extreme weather, and climate-associated productivity losses might threaten their investments. \u201cYou create an incentive to take down that risk,\u201d Schatz said. Read: It\u2019s younger and cooler than a carbon tax Of course, this is the plan for now. Events have a funny way of shifting opinions. I talked with Schatz a few hours before the first Democratic primary debate. While we spoke, dozens of climate activists protested nearby at the DNC\u2019s headquarters to demand that the party schedule a climate-change-focused debate. Schatz was skeptical of the idea. \u201cLet\u2019s say they had a health-care-only debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that, for your average viewer \u2026 that\u2019s as interesting as an actual debate. So what I want is for climate to be covered extensively in every debate, not for it to be siloed.\u201d Then the debate unfolded\u2014and the candidates spent less than 10 minutes talking about climate change . Five of the 10 candidates onstage weren\u2019t asked about it at all. This despite the fact that Democratic primary voters identified climate policy as one of the most important issues in the election. Schatz wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cTwo hours is long enough to give maybe 20-30 minutes to climate change. At least long enough to let every candidate answer a climate question or two,\u201d he tweeted before the debate ended . When the remaining time elapsed without any further discussion of climate, he seemed to reconsider his opposition to siloing the issue. \u201cMaybe the next debate,\u201d he said , \u201ccan have a climate focus.\u201d * This article originally misstated that the mayor of Minneapolis would attend the committee's first public hearing.","headline":"The Plan to Fix Climate Change in the Senate","article_name":593824.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/senate-democrats-are-getting-head-start-climate-change\/593824\/","date_published":"2019-07-12 13:56:05","article_length":8496,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:07.886911","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/senate-democrats-are-getting-head-start-climate-change\/593824\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The coronavirus could change lingering cultural assumptions about what makes for a full and happy life. A few weeks into the pandemic, a meme circulated among some of the mothers I follow on various social-media platforms. \u201cCheck in on your friends with little kids,\u201d the words in a tiny black serif font on a light-pink background read, followed by a fairly long list of things parents with young kids couldn\u2019t do, including \u201cgo for a run by themselves,\u201d \u201cpeacefully read a book or start a new project,\u201d and \u201cgo to the bathroom by themselves.\u201d This innocuous-seeming post caught my eye because it felt like a cry for help. My friends were getting honest about how hard it is to raise children right now. I also read it as an indirect plea to not take my child-free privileges for granted. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to parent a young child, let alone parent in a pandemic. I can imagine it, but like most life-altering experiences, it\u2019s one of those things you have to live to truly understand. I\u2019ve always been ambivalent about whether I would have children, but as I entered my early 40s, I started exploring the possibility of having a child on my own. And then the pandemic happened. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the brokenness of America\u2019s institutions: police violence and the inhumane criminal-justice system, a medical system that lacks infrastructure and essential equipment, precarious employment for an in-debt population getting by month to month, the toxic effects of globalization and climate change. Add to that list middle-class parenting, long an aspirational experience, whose social protections are now showing themselves to be a bit of a charade. Read: This isn\u2019t sustainable for working parents While the parents in my life have been openly acknowledging the challenges of parenting during the pandemic, my child-free friends have for the first time been sharing that they are relieved they don\u2019t have children. Many of us have been quietly admitting to one another that a decision we\u2019ve often been told we\u2019d regret or should be ashamed of doesn\u2019t seem like the worst decision in the world. These types of conversations have garnered renewed interest in recent weeks, and not just among my friends. An essay series in The Guardian , called \u201c Childfree ,\u201d explores that decision, with reasoning that runs the gamut: not enough money, focusing on your own life, the climate crisis, being fine with being alone. The series wasn\u2019t pinned to life amid a pandemic, but it seems especially apt in this moment. The gap between parents and the child-free has also been evident on Twitter. In response to a harmless tweet from a parent about how \u201cnon-parents have no idea how hard it\u2019s been\u201d to parent during the pandemic, thousands of people chimed in with some version of: Yes, we do\u2014that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have kids . That particular exchange has all the supercharged, often annoying characteristics of internet debate, but it highlights a long-standing tension. This is hardly the first moment that the idea of marriage and a baby as the primary path for women has come under scrutiny. Early feminists openly discussed the pressures of motherhood. Betty Friedan\u2019s The  Feminine Mystique started with \u201cthe problem that has no name,\u201d which was the unhappiness of married women stuck at home with children. She wrote, \u201cThere is no other way for a woman to dream of creation or of the future. There is no way she can even dream about herself, except as her children\u2019s mother, her husband\u2019s wife.\u201d That has obviously changed. Nine years ago, Kate Bolick\u2019s Atlantic essay , which became her memoir about single life, Spinster , made waves. In it, she detailed all the ways that women were upending what society expected of them. She wrote, \u201cA childless single woman of a certain age is no longer automatically perceived as a barren spinster.\u201d Friedan and Bolick were both generally speaking to the experiences of middle-class white women . For less privileged women and women of color, of course, becoming a parent has not always been framed as an empowering \u201cchoice\u201d (single Black mothers, for example, are routinely demonized, not heralded, for exercising their choice). Still, I started thinking about these texts again as I reflected on what my friends with children were going through and how, despite our recognition of the oppressiveness of these expectations, they appeared unchanged. The pandemic has only intensified the pressures that already existed for middle-class parents. Child-care costs were high , but they at least gave you some freedom to work; now families are raising children without the usual support. As schools and day-care centers reopen, they must address new safety concerns. For heterosexual parents, the bulk of the child care falls on the mother. The global health crisis has worsened this sexist division of labor, and the long-term effects could damage women\u2019s careers and, despite the best intentions, become a new norm. Read: The coronavirus is a disaster for feminism Single parenting during the pandemic is especially hard if you don\u2019t have live-in support, but on some level the assumption is that it is going to be tough\u2014single motherhood, like motherhood generally, has always been seen as a type of all-consuming self-sacrifice. For people who were planning to have a child, those plans might now be on hold; the process of seeking fertility treatments, for example, has gotten more complicated as access to medical procedures for elective reasons has been limited. I certainly felt dissuaded when I heard stories about the difficulty of giving birth right now, and when I called to check in on my friends with young children and saw how they were faring. Even before the pandemic, the overall trend was that women were delaying having kids. Statistically, educated, urban-dwelling, middle-class women are having children later in life or forgoing having them at all . And while there is a divide along lines of education, class, and race, for younger women, birth rates are down \u2014for many reasons, including financial instability, increased access to contraception, and choosing your career over having a child. Childless people have long been chastised for being selfish or for not fulfilling a role their body seemingly bound them to. These expectations may have grown less explicit, but the pressures remain. The timid ways my child-free friends are currently having this discussion contrasted to the sharpness of the debates online suggest that, on some level, we haven\u2019t been able to move beyond this impasse. In her 2015 anthology, Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed , Meghan Daum wrote that the complexities that make people decide to have or not have children are endless. She was frustrated that the conversation \u201cso often pits parents against non-parents and assumes that the former are self-sacrificing and mature and the latter are overgrown teenagers living large on piles of disposable income.\u201d That divide isn\u2019t as obvious today, but it hasn\u2019t entirely gone away. Not having children hasn\u2019t made the pandemic a yoga retreat for me, exactly. As a child-free woman in my 40s, I\u2019ve been tasked with taking care of my parents. After my father died last year, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Navigating her recovery during the pandemic has certainly given me a taste of what parenting is like\u2014keeping someone safe who is too vulnerable to do things on her own. Being child-free during the pandemic also means running the risk of losing sight of the bigger picture. Having children can give you a daily, front-and-center reason to fight for a healthy and safe future. Some parents are welcoming the additional time they are getting to spend with their families. In a moment like this, it can be hard to convince yourself to get out of bed. With kids who wake up early, you have no choice. But for the first time in a long time, I don\u2019t think it really makes sense for me to have children; the future is too uncertain and the current environment too unsafe. Many other child-free people are similarly grappling with a recognition that the structures\u2014social, educational, medical\u2014that we often assume will provide us with support won\u2019t serve us. As Rebecca Solnit writes in The Mother of All Questions , her book of essays on the barriers to embracing a life without children, \u201cThe problem may be a literary one: we are given a single story line about what makes a good life, even though not a few who follow that story line have bad lives. We speak as though there is one good plot with one happy outcome, while the myriad forms a life can take flower\u2014and wither\u2014all around us.\u201d One legacy of the pandemic may be less judgment of the child-free. The life we can all build together after that is yet to be imagined.","headline":"One Legacy of the Pandemic May Be Less Judgment of the Child-Free","article_name":614896.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2020\/08\/pandemic-changing-my-mind-about-having-kids\/614896\/","date_published":"2020-08-05 11:00:00","article_length":8791,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:08.378497","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2020\/08\/pandemic-changing-my-mind-about-having-kids\/614896\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A Harvard professor says his company should be able to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, at industrial scales, by 2021. A team of scientists from Harvard University and the company Carbon Engineering announced on Thursday that they have found a method to cheaply and directly pull carbon-dioxide pollution out of the atmosphere. If their technique is successfully implemented at scale, it could transform how humanity thinks about the problem of climate change. It could give people a decisive new tool in the race against a warming planet, but could also unsettle the issue\u2019s delicate politics, making it all the harder for society to adapt. Their research seems almost to smuggle technologies out of the realm of science fiction and into the real. It suggests that people will soon be able to produce gasoline and jet fuel from little more than limestone, hydrogen, and air. It hints at the eventual construction of a vast, industrial-scale network of carbon scrubbers, capable of removing greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere. Above all, the new technique is noteworthy because it promises to remove carbon dioxide cheaply . As recently as 2011, a panel of experts estimated that it would cost at least $600 to remove a metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The new paper says it can remove the same ton for as little as $94, and for no more than $232. At those rates, it would cost between $1 and $2.50 to remove the carbon dioxide released by burning a gallon of gasoline in a modern car. \u201cIf these costs are real, it is an important result,\u201d said Ken Caldeira , a senior scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. \u201cThis opens up the possibility that we could stabilize the climate for affordable amounts of money without changing the entire energy system or changing everyone\u2019s behavior.\u201d The team published their results Thursday morning in Joule, a new American scientific journal printed by the same publisher behind the biology journal Cell. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is build a [direct-air capture] process that is\u2014as much as possible\u2014built on existing processes and technologies that are widespread in the world,\u201d said David Keith , a professor of applied physics at Harvard and the lead author of the new study. \u201cThat\u2019s why we think we have a reasonable possibility of scaling up.\u201d Keith is also a founder and executive chairman of Carbon Engineering, a Bill Gates\u2013funded company that has studied how to directly remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon Engineering says the technique unveiled today has already been implemented at its small, pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia. It is currently seeking funding to build an industrial-scale version of the plant, which Keith says it can complete by 2021. Their technique, while chemically complicated, does not rely on unprecedented science. In effect, Keith and his colleagues have grafted a cooling tower onto a paper mill. It has three major steps. First, outside air is sucked into the factory\u2019s \u201ccontactors\u201d and exposed to an alkaline liquid. These contactors resemble industrial cooling towers: They have large fans to inhale air from the outside world, and they\u2019re lined with corrugated plastic structures that allow as much air as possible to come into contact with the liquid. In a cooling tower, the air is meant to cool the liquid; but in this design, the air is meant to come into contact with the strong base. \u201cCO 2 is a weak acid, so it wants to be in the base,\u201d said Keith. Second, the now-watery liquid (containing carbon dioxide) is brought into the factory, where it undergoes a series of chemical reactions to separate the base from the acid. The liquid is frozen into solid pellets, slowly heated, and converted into a slurry. Again, these techniques have been borrowed from elsewhere in chemical industry: \u201cTaking CO 2 out of a carbonate solution is what almost every paper mill in the world does,\u201d Keith told me. Finally, the carbon dioxide is combined with hydrogen and converted into liquid fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This is in some ways the most conventional aspect of the process: Oil companies convert hydrocarbon gases into liquid fuels every day, using a set of chemical reactions called the Fischer-Tropsch process . But it\u2019s key to Carbon Engineering\u2019s business: It means the company can produce carbon-neutral hydrocarbons . What does that mean? Consider an example: If you were to burn Carbon Engineering\u2019s gas in your car, you would release carbon-dioxide pollution out of your tailpipe and into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. But as this carbon dioxide came from the air in the first place, these emissions would not introduce any new CO 2 to the atmosphere. Nor would any new oil have to be mined to power your car. Eventually, a similar process could be used to sequester greenhouse gases. Instead of converting carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel, Carbon Engineering could pump it deep into the ground, reducing the amount of heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere. But such a technique wouldn\u2019t give Carbon Engineering any product to sell, and there are no buyers stepping up to front the effort, for now. \u201cThe main, near-term market is making carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels,\u201d Keith told me. \u201cWe see this as a technology for decarbonizing transportation.\u201d Speaking from Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, Keith said he was \u201cpretty optimistic\u201d about climate change. \u201cThe reason is that the market for these low-carbon fuels is much, much better than they were a few years ago. At the same time, low-carbon power\u2014electricity generated by solar and wind\u2014has just gotten much cheaper.\u201d Outside experts said they were encouraged by Keith and his colleagues\u2019 approach, but cautioned that it would take time to examine every cost estimate and engineering advance in the paper. The consensus response was something like: Hmm! I hope this works! \u201cI don\u2019t question that the range of costs they report are valid. I think the lower end of $100 per ton of CO 2  produced through their approach is probably doable in five years or so and that their higher end of $250 per [ton of] CO 2 is more doable with their technology today,\u201d says Jennifer Wilcox, an associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines. \u201cThe improvements that Carbon Engineering have made all seem appropriate, and I am comfortable that their estimated costs are within the window of what I would expect from such improvements,\u201d says Roger Aines, a senior scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s energy program. \u201cThe strongest part of this paper, in my opinion, is the fact that they\u2019ve actually tested the technology in a prototype plant for a few years. That\u2019s a big deal, and offers a proof of principle that\u2019s way stronger than simple calculations or computational models,\u201d says Scott Hersey, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Olin College. Caldeira said that the paper offered hope for the trickiest parts of the economy to adapt to climate change. \u201cThis suggests that the hardest-to-decarbonize parts of the economy (e.g. steel, cement manufacture, long-distance air travel, etc.) might continue just as they are now, and we just pay for CO 2 removal,\u201d he told me. He continued: \u201cDepending on how you count things, global GDP is somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 to $110 trillion. So, to remove all of this CO 2 would be something like 3 to 5 percent of global GDP (if the $100 a ton number is right). This puts an upper bound on how expensive it could be to solve the climate problem, because there are lots of ways to reduce emissions for less than $100 a ton.\u201d Keith said it was important to still stop emitting carbon-dioxide pollution where feasible. \u201cMy view is we should stick to trying to cut emissions first. As a voter, my view is it\u2019s cheaper not to emit a ton of [carbon dioxide] than it is to emit it and recapture it.\u201d \u201cBut once emissions are heading downhill and we\u2019re heading back down to zero\u2014which maybe could be 10 or 15 years from now\u2014then I\u2019m happy to see more large-scale removal of carbon dioxide.\u201d","headline":"Climate Change Can Be Reversed by Turning Air Into Gasoline","article_name":562289.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/06\/its-possible-to-reverse-climate-change-suggests-major-new-study\/562289\/","date_published":"2018-06-07 15:01:51","article_length":8078,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:09.221960","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/06\/its-possible-to-reverse-climate-change-suggests-major-new-study\/562289\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Deep in shady forests and at the bottom of towering canyons, climate refugia could provide the stability that vulnerable species need. It\u2019s a four-hour drive from Toni Lyn Morelli\u2019s home near Amherst, Massachusetts, to her field sites on the slopes of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. She rises long before dawn to make that drive, arriving by 8 a.m. to meet her student assistants. With her team assembled, Morelli, a research ecologist with the Department of the Interior\u2019s Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, spends the day, and several more to come, livetrapping red squirrels, which she tags, radio-collars, measures, and releases. Every three weeks, someone from her team returns, telemetry antennas in hand, to track how the animals are moving about the mountains. While red squirrels shift their distribution from year to year as spruces and other conifers they feed on shed their seeds, the climatic conditions they\u2019re sensitive to aren\u2019t changing uniformly. Observing how the squirrels move through this environment, then, will help the researchers find areas of relative stability. These are known as climate refugia. \u201cRefugia provide a safe haven during periods of an unfavorable climate,\u201d Morelli and her co-authors wrote in the journal PLOS One in 2016. Indeed, such areas\u2014whether they be on mountain slopes, in shady forests, or in deep, cool canyons\u2014are characterized as being naturally buffered from local and regional climate changes. As global temperatures rise, these pockets could help to ensure the continued existence of valued species. In identifying refugia, Morelli and her collaborators\u2014part of a cadre of conservation scientists working on this issue\u2014hope their efforts will contribute to improvements in land management. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create a product that is as useful as possible,\u201d Morelli says. To be sure, those seeking to implement climate-mitigation strategies face challenges, particularly when it comes to federal property overseen by the current administration. Last month, the Bureau of Land Management published a plan to strip protections for the sage grouse\u2014a ground-dwelling bird in the American West\u2014to open up millions of acres to drilling and mining. And in 2017, President Donald Trump drastically reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, shrinking Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante by 85 and 50 percent, respectively. Read: The government\u2019s surprising history of squirrel population engineering Still, in those areas that remain under protection , land managers play an important role in deciding how lands are allocated for conservation. Identifying and protecting refugia, Morelli admits, is not necessarily a long-term solution. But it can buy conservationists time to develop more comprehensive adaptation plans. \u201cOn a certain timescale, everything will change,\u201d she says. But land managers \u201care really on board with this and want to apply it under the existing management framework.\u201d The concept of climate refugia originated in the study of paleoecology, which looks at the relationships between organisms and their environment across geologic timescales. Research shows that we can credit these safe harbors with producing much of our planet\u2019s biodiversity. The Great Smoky Mountains in the southeastern United States, for example, are home to one of the world\u2019s most diverse temperate ecosystems because that range was a place of refuge during the glaciations and subsequent warming periods of the Pleistocene. Such areas occur from the Amazon to the Arctic, and millennia after the last glaciations they remain strongholds of biodiversity. Today researchers have adopted the refugia model as a way to understand how species may (or may not) persist in our current era of climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working to move the theoretical concept of paleoclimate refugia into a modern context,\u201d Morelli says of her work. \u201cWe are looking for areas where the ecological, physical, and even sociocultural aspects of the current climate will continue into the future.\u201d While large areas like the Smokies are relatively rare, refugia are not all that uncommon, particularly in mountainous landscapes. A mountain valley, for example, may receive the benefit of cold air descending from higher-elevation slopes or the cooling impact of a cold, spring-fed river. Mountaintops and high ridges can be refuges for alpine species. Even in the face of global change, such areas can remain relatively stable. Through a combination of fieldwork, mapping, statistical modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration, Morelli has been defining potential refugia in the Northeast, and working with fellow researchers on projects in western North America. But the information she and other scientists are after does not come easily. \u201cIn many places, we just do not have the fine-scale data needed to map these attributes,\u201d Morelli says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough about what is there now, let alone what will be there in the future. For ecology and behavior, we need supportive research.\u201d Trying to understand the survival threshold for every species in a study area is all but impossible. As a shortcut, then, researchers look for a representative species\u2014a creature well studied and understood, or one confined to a specific habitat. They might also look for a species that, like the red squirrel in the Northeast, can tell us something about the forests in which it lives\u2014an indicator for the ecosystem as a whole. In addition to her work in the eastern United States, Morelli has also studied potential refugia high in the mountains of California\u2019s Sierra Nevada. The Belding\u2019s ground squirrel makes its home in these meadows. A true hibernator, the species is awake for as little as three months a year, during which time it must forage, put on sufficient fat, breed, and construct underground burrows. The squirrels rely on snowpack for efficient hibernation. Too little snow, or midwinter melts, and they find themselves exposed to dangerous shifts in the temperatures outside. However, if snowpack remains stable, Belding\u2019s ground squirrels survive, and co-existing species are likely to persist as well. Morelli describes Belding\u2019s squirrels as having a narrow \u201cpinch point\u201d\u2014if their environment falls much outside of a certain range, they can no longer survive. Rather than looking at single species or even a single habitat within the Sierra Nevada, Julia Michalak, a research scientist at the University of Washington\u2019s Urban Ecology Research Laboratory, takes a broader approach, employing geographic information systems, a tool for building digital maps of the environment. Placing a grid overlay upon a map of the Sierras and indexing each cell according to the existing climate, Michalak can flag areas that warm or cool less than 1 degree Celsius and have little or no change in precipitation as potential refugia. Read: Is anywhere on Earth safe from climate change? Finding refugia is about defining thresholds, Michalak says. \u201cWe looked at historic range boundaries of a whole bunch of different species\u2014trees, amphibians, birds, and mammals\u2014and calculated a metric of precipitation and temperature variables,\u201d she says. Using these two important climate metrics, Michalak says, researchers can apply different climate scenarios to determine how the landscape will change or not. Just how those thresholds are set, however, \u201ccan really affect how many refugia or analogous climates are found,\u201d Michalak notes. Of course, defining potential refugia based on arbitrary assignments of what is an acceptable change in temperature or precipitation is problematic. After all, what seems a minor change from the perspective of a computer model may push a species across ecological thresholds where it can no longer survive. But factoring in the historic data, Michalak says, can help make those thresholds less arbitrary and more biologically informed. Still, one of the biggest challenges, she admits, is working with \u201ca limited understanding of how any individual species will respond.\u201d That includes species like the Belding\u2019s ground squirrel. If models indicate that snowpack will be consistent and sufficient for the squirrel\u2019s survival, then those areas are almost certain to be effective refugia. The combination of Morelli\u2019s and Michalak\u2019s differing strategies may be one of the most effective methods to find natural areas resistant to climate change. In such areas, alpine meadows, the squirrels, wildflowers, and innumerable other dependent species may persist, even if surrounded by shifting ecosystems. While it may be hard to square why society should value such species, or care if their habitats disappear, conservationists say their fates may be indicative of our own. Belding\u2019s ground squirrels\u2019 survival depends on snowpack, and that same snowpack provides water to parched communities in the West. If researchers like Michalak and Morelli can determine where Belding\u2019s ground squirrels are likely to survive, then that information could also be used to predict which rivers and streams will continue to flow through the summer, providing much-needed water to the farms, ranches, and towns in the valleys below. Back in the Northeast, red squirrels serve as an indicator of the health of the boreal forest ecosystem, reflecting how the economies that depend on it (namely, timber and tourism) will fare. Even with refugia identified, however, simply setting land aside is not enough. While many potential refugia fall in mountainous areas that bear some level of protection as public lands, Carlos Carroll, a conservation biologist at the Klamath Center for Conservation Research in California, notes that \u201cin order to move to and between refugia, [some] species will be forced into unprotected lowland areas.\u201d Assuring the existence of intact corridors, then, may be as important as conserving the refugia themselves. \u201cThat,\u201d Carroll says, \u201cis a much greater conservation challenge.\u201d","headline":"The Best Real Estate to Get Animals Through Climate Change","article_name":579802.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/climate-refugia-shelter-species-changing-world\/579802\/","date_published":"2019-01-09 18:38:37","article_length":9998,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:09.630789","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/climate-refugia-shelter-species-changing-world\/579802\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The dust is settling on the 2018 midterms\u2014and no plan to fight global warming has emerged unscathed. There were some elections last week in the United States. The results were pretty good for the climate-concerned. Democrats swept into the House of Representatives, winning nearly 40 seats in the chamber. For the first time since 2010, the chair of the House Science Committee will affirm the reality of human-caused climate change . It was a fine Tuesday, in other words, for the day-to-day climate advocacy of the Democratic Party. And since Democrats also won a majority of state attorney-general slots , it was an even better Tuesday for their power to fight Donald Trump\u2019s climate agenda in court. In fact, it\u2019s entirely possible that for Americans who care about climate change, it was the best Tuesday since November 8, 2016. But it wasn\u2019t perfect. Climate change needs more than day-to-day partisan advocacy. As I\u2019ve written before , Democrats lack a climate strategy: While the party\u2019s leaders preach about the problem\u2019s urgency, it\u2019s unclear what they actually want to do next time they control Congress and the White House. Democrats have also allowed nonpartisan  economists to dominate climate-policy conversations, leading to proposals that inspire nobody but other nonpartisan economists. Democrats also lack an obvious path to near-term power in the Senate , making sweeping climate legislation unlikely. Read: Democrats are shockingly unprepared to fight climate change. Democrats have many problems, in other words. Meanwhile, Earth will keep warming. But Democrats are not the only ones flailing. In the wake of President Trump\u2019s victory, climate advocates across the political spectrum have cast about for paths forward\u2014and they have assembled (loosely) into a few different teams. Each is built around what might be called a theory of change: If we only got everyone on board with this plan, then we could finally pass a big climate policy in the United States. These camps make up the climate battle that happens behind the scenes. Last Tuesday was only one election, encompassing thousands of candidates who campaigned on issues that mostly weren\u2019t climate change. It would be ludicrous to try to extract lasting takeaways for the climate movement from that range of specific, never-to-be-repeated contests. It would generate some flawed conclusions. It might even be a fundamentally silly exercise. But let\u2019s try it anyway. I looked closely at climate advocates\u2019 theories of change to see which could claim vindication from the midterm results, and I\u2019m not sure a single one emerged looking vastly stronger and more obviously correct than it did before. Theory 1: Team Bipartisan One popular argument holds that climate change will only be solved by working across the aisle. This camp has long rallied around the Climate Solutions Caucus , a group of House members that has stayed perfectly bipartisan by design: A Democrat can only join the group if he or she convinces a Republican to join too (and vice versa). Though committed to no particular policy, the caucus is affiliated with the Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby, a similarly nonpartisan association that calls for a carbon fee . The caucus has never passed legislation, but it has seemed popular, and by last month it boasted 90 members. Yet in the election, it hemorrhaged members\u2014and lost one of its co-founders. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from southern Florida, helped establish the caucus two years ago; he also proposed a symbolic carbon-tax bill this summer that, while criticized by many environmentalists , would have allowed the United States to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement . Curbelo lost his election, and a Democrat will represent his district next year. He isn\u2019t the only climate moderate gone. Twenty-two of the Climate Solutions Caucus\u2019s 43 voting GOP members will be out of the next Congress; at least 21 of their districts will be represented by Democrats. Caucus members who survived the election look a little less like Curbelo and a little more like Matt Gaetz: a Fox News regular who occasionally talks about climate change but who once sought to \u201cterminate the EPA. \u201d Read: The GOP just lost its most important climate moderates. This destruction doesn\u2019t bode well for #TeamBipartisan. Curbelo\u2019s apparent concern for the climate did not help him last Tuesday\u2014nor did it make the Democratic Party less aggressive about pursuing his seat. So barring something unprecedented\u2014like a bunch of Republicans from deep-red districts suddenly deciding to address climate change specifically\u2014the results suggest that a bipartisan, caucus-based approach to fixing climate change is unstable. Democrats will always try to pick off the GOP\u2019s moderates, on climate change or any other issue. And as the Republican Party becomes even Trumpier and the number of moderates in Congress continues to decline , a bipartisan caucus seems far more likely to provide flimsy cover for endangered suburban Republicans than to lead to substantive legislative opportunities for climate-concerned Democrats. Theory 2: Think Globally, Act Municipally Over the past two years, powerful progressives have insisted that cities and states\u2014and especially blue states\u2014are now leading the fight against climate change. Twenty states and 50 major cities have vowed to honor the Paris Agreement and attempt to cut their carbon emissions. Michael Bloomberg even sorta, kinda represents this group internationally, as the United Nations special envoy for climate action . \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything America would have done if it had stayed committed,\u201d he said last year . Yet last week, one of the most progressive and outdoorsy states in the country defeated a ballot question that would have established America\u2019s first carbon tax. Initiative 1631 in Washington State would have charged companies $15 for every ton of carbon pollution they emit , then spent the windfall on solar and wind energy, new transit projects, and wilderness conservation. It was endorsed by every major environmental group, every major civil-rights group, 19 local tribal nations, Bill Gates, and\u2014in case liberals weren\u2019t convinced\u2014REI. Statewide, Democrats trounced in last week\u2019s elections: Almost 59 percent of voters reelected the Democrat Maria Cantwell to the U.S. Senate. Yet nearly the same number, 56 percent, rejected the carbon-tax measure. It doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence in the \u201cstates and cities\u201d plan. Now, Washington is not necessarily an ideal test case for carbon-tax advocates. Even among progressives, there\u2019s a high degree of opposition to any kind of taxes in the state: Washington is one of seven states in the union that does not levy an income tax. In the past century, its voters have rejected revenue-raising ballot questions 75 percent of the time . But at the same time, it\u2019s not like the state is a crimson-red redoubt full of hippie-hating shut-ins. The state gives Trump some of his worst approval numbers . \u201cDoing fun stuff in nature\u201d is basically the Evergreen State\u2019s unofficial civic religion . Washingtonians are slightly more likely than Americans as a whole to express concern about global warming. Yet three times in the past two years its voters or legislators have nixed an innovative new climate law. Nearly two years after Trump\u2019s inauguration, there\u2019s still only one state\u2014California\u2014that can claim to have anything like a robust, economy-wide climate program. And while California\u2019s policies have been expanded and strengthened by a Democratic \u201ctrifecta,\u201d one of its most important climate laws was signed into law in 2006 by a moderate Republican governor. (Albeit a very unusual Republican\u2014a former movie star who would probably not be a Republican today .) Nick Abraham, who organized the ballot campaign in Washington, told me that the difficulty lay in converting urban support for climate policy into state-level victories. \u201cThe wider you go, the harder this thing is,\u201d he said. He pointed to a successful ballot question in Portland, Oregon, that imposed a new tax on large retailers to fund wind and solar projects . \u201cI\u2019m sure we won Seattle by the same margin that Portland won their initiative,\u201d he said. Theory 3: The Exxon of My Enemy Is My Friend Some have argued that fossil-fuel companies are key to combatting climate change. ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP have all called for a carbon tax in the United States. Last month, Exxon even donated $1 million to the nonprofit that supports their preferred plan; BP\u2019s chief executive has promised to cut emissions and made concerned noises about climate change to The New York Times . \u201cA company getting behind its product being taxed is a very rare thing,\u201d remarked Lawrence Summers , a Harvard economist and former treasury secretary, after the Exxon news broke. \u201cThis reflects a new and important awareness that we have to do big things about climate.\u201d Yet those same fossil-fuel companies bankrolled the campaign against Washington\u2019s proposed carbon tax. BP dumped $13 million into the state in order to block the measure\u2014even though it claims to support a carbon tax. Overall, a handful of oil companies spent $31 million to defeat the initiative , making it the most expensive ballot-question fight in Washington State history. The scale of that spend will only increase suspicions that the oil industry\u2019s claimed support for climate policy is not in good faith. And it will intensify pressure on Democrats to swear off all donations from fossil-fuel companies. Theory 4: A Tax by Any Other Name Would Be More Sweet For decades, economists have favored carbon prices because they create disincentives for carbon emissions without picking technological winners and losers among alternate energy sources. The most famous scholar of carbon taxes won a Nobel Prize in economics this year. But American voters have not had the same ardor for the idea, even when they love renewable energy (which carbon taxes will support) and want to regulate carbon emissions (which carbon taxes do). And some critics, especially on the left, have recently grown skeptical of the policy as a cure-all for climate change. They do not reject carbon taxes entirely, but insist that they should be one small aspect of a much more ambitious platform. Truth be told, carbon-tax opponents probably had the best night of anyone last Tuesday. Americans seem to prefer climate \u201ckludges\u201d: policies that obviously help one technology or explicitly ban another. Economists can lament all they want that these policies waste money compared with a carbon tax; for now, voters don\u2019t seem to care. In Nevada, voters passed a measure to require power companies to get half of their energy from renewables by 2050. In Florida, voters opted to ban all offshore drilling\u2014while simultaneously banning all indoor vaping. ( That is not a joke. ) Read: The Republican carbon tax is Republican, say Republicans. These policies were not victorious everywhere. A pro-renewables measure failed in Arizona after the state utility spent $54 million to oppose it. Yet at least for now, climate kludges seem to be more popular than carbon prices. And researchers are adapting. On the morning after the election, the Carnegie Mellon University energy economist Costa Samaras rattled off a long list of policies on Twitter that he implied would now take center stage in a climate policy. They included new tax credits, loan guarantees, and the subsidized purchase of electric-vehicle fleets. \u201cIt\u2019s sub-optimal,\u201d he said , \u201cbut so are most sandwiches and I still eat them.\u201d So where does all this lead? I suspect we already have a preview. Exactly one week after the election, nearly 200 activists held a demonstration at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Capitol Hill. They called for House Democrats to begin generating a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d: a comprehensive strategy on climate change that would rival \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in its aspirational but policy-dense pithiness. They demanded broad but often easy-to-visualize goals, like generating 100 percent of U.S. electricity through renewable sources. They also demanded the full decarbonization and repair of transportation infrastructure, as well as a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in technology that can remove greenhouse gas from the air. Not once did they mention a carbon tax: a market-based solution that had once been the gold-standard policy for an earlier generation of climate leaders, like Al Gore . The era of proud climate kludging has begun.","headline":"The New Politics of Climate Change","article_name":575422.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/midterms-2018-now-nobody-has-perfect-climate-strategy\/575422\/","date_published":"2018-11-16 12:10:00","article_length":12511,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:10.709358","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/midterms-2018-now-nobody-has-perfect-climate-strategy\/575422\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A long obsession with Mars makes all the other worlds seem a little neglected. Paul Byrne loves Mars. He wrote his doctoral thesis and several research papers about the planet. Most of his graduate students study Mars. And yet, earlier this year, he posed this question on Twitter: \u201cIf you could end the pandemic by destroying one of the planets, which one would you choose and why would it be Mars?\u201d What does Byrne, a planetary scientist at North Carolina State University, have against the red planet? Nothing, he told me. But everyone else loves Mars too, and maybe a little too much. Aside from Earth and the moon, humankind has studied Mars more than any other world in the universe. In the United States, many planetary scientists are devoted, in one way or another, to the study of Mars. Since 1996, NASA has sent more than a dozen robots to orbit, rove, dig, and hop around the planet. The latest NASA rover, Perseverance, departed for Mars in July, days after China and the United Arab Emirates launched their own missions to the planet. Read: A startling spike on Mars The Mars monopoly is strong enough that it makes all the other worlds in the solar system seem a little neglected. Scientists are now preparing to negotiate top priorities for the future, a process that takes place once a decade. Mars won out in the previous round, leading to the Perseverance mission. This time, many scientists are rooting for a less Mars-centric outcome. The process, worked out over months in papers and panels, will consider a host of possibilities, all while reckoning with a fundamental question: Why explore any of these worlds at all? Mars is marvelous\u2014and there\u2019s still a lot to learn about it: NASA\u2019s fleet of rovers, designed to move at less than a mile an hour , has covered only a tiny piece of the planet, and to planetary scientists, there\u2019s no such thing as too many data from another world. But several other worlds are worthy of attention, and they could yield surprises that Mars likely cannot. While rovers have rendered Mars in stunning detail, capturing the fine texture of boulders and bedrock, spacecraft have experienced the outer planets as near-featureless orbs, their depths obscured in haze. Take, for example, Neptune and Uranus, which some scientists say stand a good chance of becoming top priorities in the upcoming negotiations. No spacecraft have visited these planets since the 1980s , and even those missions were onetime flybys. Launching Perseverance meant downsizing a mission to Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter, where life might swim in a subsurface ocean. An earlier Mars robot was chosen over a mission that would have dropped a boat on Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon, where the lakes are filled with liquid methane . The last time a spacecraft touched the surface of Titan was 2005, and its batteries lasted only a scant 72 minutes. (NASA approved a new mission to Titan last summer, but the spacecraft won\u2019t reach the moon until 2034.) \u201cOne of the really embarrassing things is that we don\u2019t really know what the ice giants are made of,\u201d Francis Nimmo, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, told me. \u201cEverybody calls them ice giants, but we don\u2019t actually know that that\u2019s true.\u201d Ice is certainly one ingredient, Nimmo said, but beyond that, scientists can only guess. The study of other planets seems like it wouldn\u2019t have many implications for us earthlings, but making such predictions would be foolish, says Heidi Hammel, a planetary astronomer at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. When scientists studied the atmosphere of Venus, a rocky planet, in the 1970s, they discovered that the presence of chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons depletes the atmospheric ozone that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. \u201cWe used to willy-nilly just pump them into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, because why not, until we realized\u2014by looking at Venus\u2014that these chlorofluorocarbons had a very direct implication for the ozone content in the atmosphere,\u201d Hammel told me. In the \u201990s, U.S. environmental agencies banned the use of these chemicals. Read: NASA will go looking for alien life Venus might carry other lessons for Earth. It used to be a pleasant and hospitable place before its atmosphere swelled with enough heat-trapping gases that its water boiled away. Scientists don\u2019t think climate change will push Earth to this brink, but Venus is a reminder that we shouldn\u2019t take our planet\u2019s atmosphere for granted. Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and engineers haven\u2019t yet perfected hardware that could withstand the planet\u2019s scorching environment. Driving on Mars is a breeze in comparison, and rover missions there could be the key to discovering whether life has ever arisen somewhere else in the solar system. The surface of Mars hasn\u2019t changed much in the few billion years since the planet lost its atmosphere and, with it, the watery conditions that would make life possible. The Perseverance rover, when it touches down on Mars in February, will search for signs of ancient microbial life preserved in rocky formations molded by long-gone lakes and rivers. But to investigate whether life exists anywhere else in the solar system right now , Mars is probably the wrong place to look. In fact, the best candidates for this kind of search aren\u2019t planets at all. They\u2019re moons. There\u2019s Jupiter\u2019s Europa, and Saturn\u2019s Enceladus, and Neptune\u2019s Triton\u2014all shiny, ice-covered worlds that probably harbor liquid oceans in their depths. And there\u2019s Titan, the only spot in the solar system besides Earth where liquid rains down from clouds and fills lakes and streams on the surface. Read: Saturn\u2019s largest moon would make an unbelievable vacation spot These moons, however would take nearly a decade to reach. The journey to Mars takes a comparatively pleasant six months. And if the goal of exploring Mars is not just to learn more about Earth or search for alien life but to send people there someday, it makes perfect sense to deploy many robotic missions to scope out the place and test the technology. Other planets and moons are fascinating targets, with the potential to answer some of humankind\u2019s oldest existential questions. But they are harder sells in the face of some of our most intriguing daydreams and ambitions: an outpost on the moon, or a community on Mars. A second home, or at least a place to plant a national flag before someone else does . People are partial to worlds with surfaces they can actually set foot on, and the ice giants have none. Perhaps the most compelling argument for paying more attention to other worlds in the solar system, Mars or otherwise, is that they are the only ones we can conceivably visit. Astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets in the past quarter century, and they have begun studying some of them in detail, searching for indicators of life within the molecules of their atmospheres. But without the invention of warp drives straight out of Star Trek, we can\u2019t put spacecraft around these other worlds. Reaching the nearest exoplanet would take tens of thousands of years. These days, scientists can acquire a similar level of detail for some exoplanets that earlier generations did with the planets of our solar system in the \u201960s, but \u201cwe might never get beyond that,\u201d Jonathan Fortney, a planetary scientist at UC Santa Cruz, told me. Science fiction isn\u2019t necessary to imagine what scientists and engineers could reasonably do in our own cosmic backyard, and in our lifetimes. They certainly would need bigger budgets and more political will from presidents and Congresses\u2014and these decision makers usually would rather go to the moon or Mars. But imagine a boat on Titan that could sail the methane seas, smooth as glass. A spacecraft plunging through Venus\u2019s sulfuric clouds, or circling Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, the most volcanically active place in the solar system. A probe that peers into Uranus\u2019s dense atmosphere, the color of pale turquoise, and examines its moons too. Did you even know that Uranus has moons? And that one of them is named Miranda? Mars isn\u2019t our only neighbor in the solar system worth getting to know.","headline":"The Most Overhyped Planet in the Galaxy","article_name":615163.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/08\/mars-solar-system-exploration\/615163\/","date_published":"2020-08-11 17:25:00","article_length":8190,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:11.289805","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/08\/mars-solar-system-exploration\/615163\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The choice on climate change is obvious: We can spend money now on reducing the likelihood of the worst effects of climate change, or we can not, and see what how much it costs over the long run. This article is from the archive of our partner . The choice on climate change is obvious, according to a new report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: We can spend money now on reducing fossil fuel usage, or we can see what how much climate change costs over the long run. The United Nations, understandably, recommends the former.\u00a0 The IPCC\u00a0 report attempts to outline how the world's governments can mitigate the scenarios the group outlined earlier this month : increased drought, higher sea levels, reductions in food supplies, extinctions, damage to sea life.\u00a0 But how much does that mitigation cost?\u00a0 Let's start with the key data. We've created this table using information from the new climate report and other sources, to help give some insight into how the economics play out. The temperatures in the table below indicate the maximum warming by 2100. The two key data points are in bold: how much it will cost to stay at the warming levels and the amount climate change will cost if we do. In other words, 2 degrees of warming means 0.24 to 2.14 percent lower GDP growth through 2100. Four degrees means 5 to 20 percent. There are several caveats and a lot of context that should be added. First, the context. Climate change is mostly linked to fossil fuel burning. When we're talking about climate change, we're talking mostly about burning coal and oil for energy. Since 2000, global production of carbon dioxide has increased 2.2 percent, according to one graph from the report (above), thanks to increases in CO 2 production from fossil fuel burning. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently passed 400 ppm; as that level increases, temperatures will increase. Climate change is underway; the debate is over how high temperatures get by the end of the century. Thanks to the increased amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, a certain amount of global warming is already happening, as the UN report (and common sense) indicates. The question is how bad it gets. A 1 degree increase over 20th century averages by the end of this century would mean far, far fewer negative effects than a 4 degree increase \u2014\u00a0currently envisioned as the worst-case scenario. Fighting climate change will reduce global productivity. The crux of the new report is the extent to which fighting climate change \u2014\u00a0reducing the use of coal, increasing efficiency for cars, etc. \u2014\u00a0will affect the economy. Global GDP is expected to expand year-over-year for the rest of the century. Investing in fighting climate change will reduce that amount somewhat. Climate change will reduce global productivity. Of course, the negative effects of climate change will also reduce global productivity. And this is the biggest question mark from the IPCC: it isn't clear how much. But there is other information that provides a guide. And now the caveats. It is important to note that we are mixing sources in that first table. The range of costs to GDP comes from two charts produced in the IPCC report, one comparing how controlling CO 2 emissions would cost the economy and the other showing how CO 2 relates to temperature. [ SHOW CHARTS ] In both cases, we're dealing with ranges, not certainties. The economic costs from climate change itself comes from two sources. The range for a 2-degree increase is from the IPCC itself. But the 0.2 to 2 percent figure has come under fire for being too conservative. \"The quoted figures of 0.2 to 2.0 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) are at best an under-estimate, and at worst completely meaningless,\" the British government complained, according to Reuters . That's because it's extremely difficult to predict precisely which of the negative effects will happen and to what scale. Will fisheries die out? Will drought ravage crops? Will flooding take thousands of lives? Probably some combination will happen, but it's hard to value. The costs for the 4-degree increase come from the 2006 Stern Review completed by the World Bank , which figured heavy costs to the economy at that temperature increase. In January 2013, the economist who conducted that review, Nicholas Stern, argued that reality was far, far worse than his 2006 estimate. So that, too, may be an underestimate. \"Climate policy is not a free lunch,\" IPCC co-chairman Ottmar Edenhofer said at a press conference over the weekend, to point out that fighting climate change would be costly. But not fighting climate change is almost certainly going to be more costly, and with costs that are far harder to predict. Climate policy isn't a free lunch, but it would be nice if the world had enough food in 2100 to actually allow people to eat meals. This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire .

{"id":null,"body":"When our peers take actions to preserve the planet, we\u2019re more likely to follow suit. How the human instinct to conform could help us address the climate crisis. \u201cI t is worse , much worse, than you think,\u201d reads the frightening first sentence of The Uninhabitable Earth , David Wallace-Wells\u2019s comprehensive account of what researchers have discovered about our planet\u2019s climate trajectory. The severity of the crisis, he goes on to note, has made some climatologists reluctant to describe its full extent, fearing that such candor might make the challenge we face seem hopeless. The concern is understandable: Previous warnings of impending peril have done little to alter either individual behavior or public policy. More than half of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age was put there by humans after 1988, the year the climatologist James Hansen testified before Congress that a dangerous warming trend was already well under way. Worldwide, emissions continue to increase, as floods, droughts, famines, and wildfires become more frequent and more intense. This century has already been responsible for 19 of the 20 hottest years on record. According to the federal government\u2019s 2019 Arctic Report Card , rapidly melting permafrost now threatens to create feedback loops that would release much of the 1.5 trillion metric tons of carbon it holds\u2014roughly twice the amount already circulating in the atmosphere. Even now, there is much we could do to parry the climate threat. We could enact stiff carbon taxes and mandate an accelerated phaseout of fossil fuels. We could undertake massive investments in renewable-energy sources, launch large-scale reforestation , and alter the mix of foods we eat . We could rush to develop scalable methods of carbon capture and sequestration. Yet on all of these fronts, we are taking only minimal action. The politics around climate change remain intractable, and human nature itself seems ill-suited to the challenge: Putting off solving the problem\u2014or hoping it will somehow just go away\u2014is easier than confronting it. \u201cCall me a pessimist,\u201d Jonathan Franzen wrote in a grim and widely read New Yorker essay on the climate crisis, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see human nature fundamentally changing anytime soon.\u201d Having written periodically about climate issues for more than a decade, I have followed the scientific literature on the subject closely, and I understand the fatalist view that the window for an effective response is rapidly closing. But in the process, I\u2019ve also arrived at a more hopeful perspective , one rooted in another side of human nature. Properly stoked and channeled, our instincts could help support a different trajectory. R adical change can happen swiftly. I\u2019m happy to report that none of my four adult sons is a smoker. But if they\u2019d grown up when I did, I suspect that at least two of them would have taken up the habit. When my own stint as a smoker began\u2014at age 14, in 1959\u2014many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn\u2019t want me to smoke, but because they were smokers themselves, their objections rang hollow. At the time, more than half of American men and almost 30 percent of American women smoked . In some circles, it was just something that most people did. Today, fewer than 15 percent of Americans smoke . Given the difficulty of quitting, few people imagined that such a precipitous reduction in smoking rates could occur so quickly. The decline was rooted in collective measures American society took to discourage the habit. States and the federal government raised taxes on tobacco products. In the \u201950s, a pack of Camels could be had for as little as 25 cents in some locations\u2014about $2.17 in today\u2019s dollars. In many areas today, taxes have pushed that price close to $10. In New York City, a pack of cigarettes cannot be sold legally for less than $13. By the 1990s, many cities and states were banning smoking in restaurants, bars, and public buildings; some jurisdictions went so far as to prohibit the practice in outdoor public spaces as well. These measures worked, but not necessarily in the way you might think. Taxes and bans made smoking more difficult and helped some people quit, yes. But far more important, these moves kick-started a virtuous cycle. One of the strongest predictors of whether someone will become a smoker is the smoking rate among his peers. With fewer people starting to smoke, Americans had fewer smoking peers, which reduced smoking rates still further. After carefully controlling for other factors, one study estimated that if the percentage of smokers among a teen\u2019s close friends fell by 50 percent, the probability of her becoming (or remaining) a smoker would fall by about 25 percent. Social scientists have demonstrated the influence of peer behavior in a host of other areas. One study, for example, found that when military families were posted to a new location where the obesity rate was 1 percent higher than average, adults in the families were 5 percent more likely to become obese during the course of their assignment there. Behavioral contagion\u2014as the phenomenon is known\u2014can exacerbate bullying, cheating on taxes, and problem drinking, among other harmful behaviors. But people also become more likely to exercise and eat prudently when those behaviors become more widespread among peers. Read: Five radical climate policies that most Americans actually like Given the power of contagion, it is astonishing that the question of how policy makers might harness this power has received so little serious attention. Even when smoking restrictions were enacted, for instance, it was primarily to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke. But the damage done by secondhand smoke pales in comparison with the harm caused by becoming a smoker\u2014not just to the smoker himself, but also to his peers, who in turn become more likely to smoke. T he behaviors that spawned the climate crisis are perhaps even more contagious than smoking, a fact that has gone largely unnoticed by economists and climatologists, who understand global warming as a consequence of greenhouse gases being costly to eliminate and dischargeable without penalty. This assessment leads naturally to pessimism, since the costs of carbon removal remain high and political opposition to robust taxation remains formidable. It also overlooks contagion\u2019s potential power to help address this crisis. We\u2019ve been building bigger houses , driving heavier vehicles, commuting longer distances , staging more destination weddings, and engaging in a host of other energy-intensive activities only partly because their true costs to the planet are not fully priced in. The far more important reason we\u2019ve done these things is our tendency to behave as our peers do. The housing market provides a vivid illustration of this. Since the early 1970s, the lion\u2019s share of national income growth has accrued to the wealthy, who used some of their gains to build ever larger houses. The near-wealthy, who travel in the same social circles, also built bigger, and so on down the income ladder. Although median incomes grew little during the past half century, the median new house grew from about 1,500 square feet in 1973 to almost 2,400 square feet today. Without invoking the power of behavioral contagion, it\u2019s difficult to explain this change. But here is the cause for hope: Where contagion creates a problem, it can also help solve it. Just as in the case of smoking, where peer effects exacerbated and then reduced the prevalence of the practice, so too could contagion help us meet the climate challenge. Solar-panel adoption, for example, is particularly contagious. After controlling for a variety of other potentially important causal factors, one study found contagion\u2019s power in this domain to be substantial: Each new installation in a neighborhood can, over time, lead to several additional ones. (In a follow-up study, researchers have found evidence that solar panels visible from the street exert a significantly greater peer effect than those that aren\u2019t\u2014further suggesting that our neighbors\u2019 behavior affects our own.) The contagion effect in solar adoption can be seen in Google\u2019s Project Sunroof, which displays aerial photos of neighborhoods and identifies houses with solar panels by placing red dots on their roofs. Those houses tend to be near others with red dots. Read: Google\u2019s new product puts peer pressure to a sunny use There\u2019s very good reason to believe that peer effects could be similarly beneficial in other areas crucial to our climate future. Research shows that our eating habits are shaped by the habits of those around us. This effect could be harnessed to encourage people to eat healthier diets, but it could just as easily nudge people toward more environmentally sustainable ones. Consumers are also highly sensitive to contagion when choosing which car to buy. This has led Americans to choose ever bulkier SUVs. But with the right incentives, consumers could be encouraged to make a different choice. Many states already give tax breaks to buyers of electric vehicles, but that\u2019s hardly the only way to promote change. The U.S. Department of Energy has found that when a workplace installs charging stations, its employees are 20 times as likely to choose an electric car. Practicality is surely the main reason, but the daily reminder that co-workers have gone electric could also touch off a contagion effect. I have long shared the concern of climate advocates who warn that \u201cconscious consumption\u201d\u2014voluntary individual restraint in energy usage, such as buying a Tesla or avoiding plastic water bottles\u2014is no substitute for changes in public policy. One recent study even suggested that encouraging individual energy restraint could diminish support for policies like carbon taxes\u2014perhaps by instilling the belief that personal changes reduce the need for political action. But conscious consumption may promote progress in other ways I had not previously appreciated. Installing solar panels, adopting a more climate-friendly diet, or buying an electric vehicle is likely to spur others to take similar steps. It might also reinforce our identity as climate advocates; in many aspects of life, small first steps can lead to larger ones. As Will Durant distilled Aristotle\u2019s wisdom about the power of habit: \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do.\u201d E ven when everyone acknowledges that a behavior causes harm, as in the smoking example, it can be hard to reach consensus on whether\u2014and how\u2014to respond. The difficulty may stem in part from the laudable belief that people should decide for themselves which behaviors to mimic and which to avoid. But public acknowledgment of climate change, and the risks it poses, has become more widespread among Americans. Perhaps we will be able to engineer more benign social environments with simple, targeted taxes and subsidies, calibrated to amplify contagion effects, rather than with complex, intrusive regulation. Taxation is always controversial. But unlike prohibitions and prescriptive regulation, it shows respect for individual freedom by affording flexibility to those who would find it hardest to curtail harmful activities. We didn\u2019t outlaw smoking; we just tried to set its price closer to its full cost to society. We could take the same approach in the climate context: To diminish the American appetite for gas-guzzling vehicles, for instance, we should tax cars by fuel economy. We could also encourage climate-friendly behavior by reducing its cost. Embedded in the 2009 stimulus bill, designed to revive the American economy after the Great Recession, were generous subsidies for the renewable-energy industry. Those subsidies helped companies lower costs for consumers, which increased adoption rates, igniting a contagion process: Further adoption led to greater cost reductions, which has led to still more new customers. As the climate advocate Ramez Naam writes, \u201c Building new solar, wind, and storage is about to be cheaper than operating existing coal and gas power plants .\u201d Once that happens, adoption could soar. Even leaving aside taxes and subsidies, there are ways to leverage the contagion effect. Utilities, for example, have found that customers reduce their electricity usage significantly when told how their consumption compares with that of neighbors. Opower, a home-energy-management company owned by Oracle, has helped deliver these customer-comparison reports to millions of households served by utilities around the globe; it boasts that the program has helped save enough energy to power San Francisco\u2019s homes for more than 10 years. Google Nest, the manufacturer of smart thermostats, has incorporated the approach into its product: It rewards customers who choose energy-efficient settings with green leaf icons (gold stars, essentially) in their monthly usage summaries, and compares the number of leaves earned with those of other Nest users in the area. Downplaying the severity of the climate crisis would be a grave mistake. As the consensus among climatologists affirms, the threat it poses is catastrophic. Individual choices won\u2019t be enough to stave off the worst-case scenarios\u2014significant public action is required, in the United States and across the globe. But as Gregg Easterbrook warned in these pages more than a decade ago , it can also be dangerous to portray the threat as insurmountable. Previous efforts to curtail smog, acid rain, and the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons all seemed futile, Easterbrook noted, until we actually attacked those problems\u2014at which point initiatives proved far more successful (and less painful) than all but the most optimistic reformers could have hoped. As Samuel Johnson said, \u201cTo do nothing is in every man\u2019s power.\u201d But we also have the power to act, and our actions have the power to shape those of people around us. We still have time to make a difference, so why choose despair? This article is adapted from Robert H. Frank\u2019s book Under the Influence: Putting Peer Pressure to Work .

{"id":null,"body":"The most aggressive dismantling of the former president\u2019s environmental rules yet Ten months in, and the presidency of Donald Trump has acquired a reputation for ineffectiveness. Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal Obamacare has failed three times; he has taunted and alienated some congressional Republicans; he has hemorrhaged senior administration officials while struggling to contain an FBI investigation. But Trump has found near-total success in a few areas of lawmaking\u2014and few are as expansive, with consequences as long-lasting, as environmental policy. Since January, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s broad legacy of EPA rules meant to lessen the blow of climate change. It has largely succeeded. This week, Trump\u2019s team opens a new front in that war. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, announced Monday that he will fully repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration\u2019s signature plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the U.S. electricity sector. It\u2019s the new administration\u2019s most aggressive attempt to materially transform U.S. climate policy since its departure from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower greenhouse-gas emissions from American power plants by 32 percent by 2030, as compared to their historical peak in 2005. It constituted the central legal mechanism to meet the American commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Speaking in the coal-mining town of Hazard, Kentucky, Pruitt alleged that the Clean Power Plan represented illegal executive overreach. He also linked it to a \u201cwar on coal\u201d that he says was waged by the Obama administration. \u201cThe past administration was unapologetic. They were using every bit of power [and] authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers on how we generate electricity in this country. That is wrong,\u201d he said. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a longtime Republican of Kentucky, appeared by his side. Environmentalists condemned the repeal and promised to fight it in court. Ditching the Clean Power Plan, they said, would further degrade the planet\u2019s climate by leading to the release of more heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. Public-health groups, including the American Lung Association, also condemned the planned repeal. Nearly half of Americans already live in counties with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the organization has said , adding that climate change appears to makes conventional air pollutants worse. \u201cScience shows that warmer temperatures can reduce air quality, due to increases in ozone and particulate matter,\u201d said Laura Anderko, a professor at Georgetown University. Air pollution poses a particular health threat to children, she noted. The Clean Power Plan was sold in part on its public-health benefits. A 2015 study in Nature Climate Change found that a set of rules similar to the Clean Power Plan would prevent 220 heart attacks and 3,500 premature deaths per year. Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas would all see the greatest gains under the simulated plan, each avoiding hundreds of early deaths annually. But the Clean Power Plan has also long contained a tension inherent to American environmental law. Since 2007 , the Supreme Court has held that the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The Obama administration didn\u2019t pursue regulation at first, attempting to pass the Waxman-Markey climate-change bill through Congress . That bill would have allowed companies to bid on the right to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, mirroring previous federal laws to reduce acid rain. But after it failed in the Senate\u2014and Democrats lost control of Congress in 2010\u2014Obama\u2019s EPA turned to the Clean Air Act. Over the course of several years, the agency studied, issued, and revised state-by-state rules guiding how local governments should reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from their power plants. The final version of the Clean Power Plan was released in August 2015, months before the Paris conference on climate change. Almost immediately after the Clean Power Plan was published, dozens of state attorneys general sued the Obama administration, alleging the rules were illegal. They were led by Pruitt, then the Oklahoma attorney general and the chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the Clean Air Act allowed the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, they argued that this plan, the Clean Power Plan, was illegal. Did the Obama rules break the law? We may never know. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was still considering the case on Election Day last year. Trump ordered the EPA to revisit the plan in an omnibus executive order in March. Due to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 ruling, the Trump administration will have to issue a new regulation to replace the Clean Power Plan. But it has great leeway in when it may issue that new rule, and it appears to be taking its time . Of course, the Clean Power Plan is not the only change convulsing the U.S. power sector. While solar and wind energy are on the rise worldwide, they have mostly displaced nuclear power in the United States. Coal use has indeed been plummeting in recent years, but this has mostly been due to cheap natural gas made available by fracking. \u201cYou want to know how you bring the coal jobs back? Ban fracking,\u201d said Ted Thomas, the chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission and a former Republican legislator in the state, in March. \u201cWhen you talk to utility professionals, there are more of them who think Elvis is still alive than believe that\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s rules are to blame for the decline in coal, he told me then . Indeed, energy experts say that the United States may meet the ostensible emissions-reduction goals of the Clean Power Plan. The Rhodium Group, an energy consulting firm at the forefront of climate-economic forecasting , projects that the U.S. power sector will fall by between 27 and 35 percent by 2030 without the Clean Power Plan . But its experts also caution the 32-percent figure was just an estimate, and the real emissions gains of the Clean Power Plan may have been higher than anticipated. Historically, energy forecasts have undershot the rise of solar and renewable energy. And there are graver implications to the rollback. The United States is not on track to reduce its carbon emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic global warming\u2014even under the most optimistic economic forecasts. A recent study on the world\u2019s carbon budget found that the world would need to reduce its emissions in ways that parallel \u201cthe Great Depression, the years following World War II, and during the collapse of the Soviet Union\u201d to stave off the worst of global warming.","headline":"Trump Repeals Obama's Landmark Climate-Change Power Plan","article_name":542403.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/the-trump-administration-repeals-obamas-central-climate-rule\/542403\/","date_published":"2017-10-09 23:09:00","article_length":6878,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:12.915389","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/the-trump-administration-repeals-obamas-central-climate-rule\/542403\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"At last night\u2019s debate, the president got confused about his own policy\u2014and Joe Biden\u2019s. The painting style of Jackson Pollock is called \u201cgestural abstraction,\u201d but before last night\u2019s debate, I never knew that it was also a governing philosophy. The debate featured many decisions from President Donald Trump that were puzzling, to put it mildly. The president constantly interrupted the moderator, Chris Wallace, and he all but jeered his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, even as Biden discussed the death toll of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a loud, shabby, obnoxious evening\u2014one of the few civic rituals I can remember that, the morning after, seems to have left viewers with a televisual hangover. Yet a few of the president\u2019s strangest political decisions came in the debate\u2019s quietest moments: the part devoted to climate change. It was one of the few instances of the debate where Trump did not constantly interrupt Biden, even occasionally allowing the former vice president to finish his paragraphs. That there even was a climate-change section was notable: A moderator had not asked a question about climate change in a general-election debate in 12 years . Even during the 2016 campaign, when Trump was threatening to revoke many environmental policies and withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, the only climate-change question was asked by an undecided voter, Ken Bone. The climate discussion, a historical novelty, somehow became the most historically normal part of last night\u2019s debate. That the climate section was so comparatively tranquil also made it among the most revealing. For years, Democrats and some centrists have argued that Trump is so in thrall to falsehood that he is incapable of governing effectively. The argument was convincing, but there was periodically room for doubt: Did Trump actually believe the mistruths about climate change \u2014or health care, or hurricane forecasting \u2014that he mouthed? Or was he more savvy than he let on, and simply an effective messenger for partisan distortions? His administration\u2019s ruinous response to Hurricane Maria spoke to his incompetence. Its muscular initial response to the coronavirus recession (if not to the virus itself) suggested his capability. But in this moment the truth managed to show through: The president is so tangled in falsehood that he struggles to even campaign effectively. Most politicians lie only when it helps them politically, but Trump lied, remarkably, to his own disadvantage. He defended unpopular rollbacks using arguments that his own administration has discredited. He falsely overstated Biden\u2019s climate policies, allowing Biden to appear moderate by comparison. And he barely managed to explain his administration\u2019s climate policy, even though polls show that environmental policy is among his most unpopular issues. The first lapse came early in the climate section, when Wallace asked him to explain his deregulatory spree, specifically his decision to freeze the fuel-economy standards, which govern the gas mileage of all new cars and trucks sold in the United States. \u201cIf you believe in the science of climate change \u2026\u201d Wallace asked, \u201cwhy have you relaxed fuel-economy standards that are gonna create more pollution from cars and trucks?\u201d \u201cWell, not really,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBecause what\u2019s happening is that the car is much less expensive, and it\u2019s a much safer car, and you\u2019re talking about a tiny difference.\u201d In other words, Trump did not rebut that the rollback will increase pollution, but claimed that his policy will make up for that pollution by reducing the cost of new cars to consumers: You might hate the dirtier air, but you\u2019ll love your new car. He went on to claim that his rollback would \u201cat least double or triple the number of cars purchased.\u201d Read: \u2018We know they had cooked the books\u2019 But this argument\u2014Trump\u2019s argument\u2014is completely untrue, according to his own administration. It was based, as I wrote earlier this year , on massively flawed math, including a broken computer program that mixed up supply and demand. When that math was fixed, the White House admitted that the gas-mileage rollback will eliminate as many as 13,500 jobs and deal as much as $22 billion in damage to the American economy. It will make consumers pay more for gas. For this reason, among others, several automakers\u2014such as Ford, Honda, and Volkswagen\u2014chose to strike a separate deal with California and ignore the rollback entirely. The rules that Trump gutted have also saved Americans nearly $500 billion at the pump, according to the nonpartisan Consumer Federation of America. His administration no longer argues that the rollback will save much money for anyone but oil companies and some carmakers. But Trump\u2019s relationship with the truth is so casual that he defended the policy to the public anyway, citing arguments that were discredited by experts who at least nominally serve under him. His other lapse happened a few minutes later. As Biden explained his own approach to climate policy, Trump cut in, accusing Biden of supporting the Green New Deal. Such a policy, Trump alleged, would cost $100 trillion. It was a ham-handed attack. Biden does not support the Green New Deal, though he has praised it in limited terms since the primary, saying that he admires its link between the climate and the economy. But the truth is that no Democrat has ever supported a $100 trillion Green New Deal: Even Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who popularized the idea, has only ever sought a $10 trillion package . The sole person who has ever claimed that a Green New Deal would cost $100 trillion is Brian Riedl, a Republican and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Biden slightly muffled his reply, saying that the Green New Deal would not cost $100 trillion before clarifying that the Green New Deal was \u201cnot my plan.\u201d But Trump ignored the opening, announcing to the room that Biden\u2019s rejection of the Green New Deal had just lost him the left. The president reiterated the point on Twitter earlier today. To actual leftists, Biden\u2019s rejection of the Green New Deal is no surprise: The Democratic Party just had a whole primary about it, and the more moderate candidate won. It\u2019s been clear for months that Biden has been desperate to distance himself from any policy such as the Green New Deal that could be construed as anti-fracking, considering the large fracking industry in Pennslyvania, a key swing state. But Trump seemed so captured by a falsehood regularly repeated in the conservative media\u2014that Biden has been commandeered by his party\u2019s left wing\u2014that he seemed to have forgotten about Biden\u2019s actual positions. But Trump got Biden to reject such a policy, publicly, on prime-time television, then celebrated it as some kind of coalition-dividing masterstroke. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s actual climate policy\u2014a nearly $2 trillion infrastructure and investment package, which would be by far the most ambitious and expensive climate bill ever passed in the United States\u2014looked like the picture of moderation. Read: So has the Green New Deal won yet? As a topic, climate change encapsulates Trump\u2019s failures. He struggles to understand that facts exist independent of whether they help or hurt him politically. Asked whether he \u201cbelieves\u201d human pollution contributes to climate change, Trump replied: \u201cI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes\u2014I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest.\u201d He could not address the deeper question\u2014do humans cause climate change?\u2014without immediately bickering about the cause of the California wildfires. In the meantime, he showed that he does not understand climate science. Virtually all scientists say that human activity, such as greenhouse-gas pollution, causes the modern warming that we\u2019ve observed. The president made other mistakes last night, and they will likely loom larger in the historical record than anything he said about the climate. There were many other abnormal moments: As my colleagues have written, he refused to condemn white supremacists, and he undermined trust in the election results. But if Trump loses in November, it will not be solely because of his failure to understand and evoke America\u2019s civic patriotism. It will be his normal failures as a leader, as an administrator, and as a rhetorician that count. They were on gleaming display last night.","headline":"Trump\u2019s Climate Self-Own","article_name":616555.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/09\/climate-change-trump-debate-emissions\/616555\/","date_published":"2020-09-30 19:57:00","article_length":8471,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:12.990586","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/09\/climate-change-trump-debate-emissions\/616555\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cMarine protected areas\u201d have been an environmental success story. But a new study finds that most won\u2019t withstand global warming. \u201cWe should\u2019ve known,\u201d said John Bruno, \u201cbut we really didn\u2019t.\u201d Bruno is a professor of marine biology at the University of North Carolina. Recently, he and his colleagues asked a simple question: If scientists know that climate change will alter national parks on land , how will it affect the thousands of national parks and conservation areas around the world that are underwater? The answer, published Monday in Nature Climate Change, shocked him. But first: Yes, there are thousands of underwater national parks. In the last few decades, conservationists have rushed to protect biodiversity in the oceans. Governments have established more than 8,000 marine protected areas, or MPAs, worldwide. These protected areas include world-famous wonders\u2014there are MPAs for Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2014but many of them also surround the United States. During his second term, President Barack Obama protected more than 750,000 square miles of ocean , expanding several national monuments created by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. These conservation areas are supposed to act as refuges, shielding animals and plants from human exploitation of the environment. But Bruno and his colleagues found that they cannot protect underwater life from environmental problems that are truly global. The world\u2019s 8,236 marine protected areas remain intensely vulnerable to climate change, their research found. \u201cThe results predict five times more warming than we\u2019ve seen in the last 15, 20 years,\u201d Bruno told me. In some areas, up to 10 times more warming is forecast. \u201cGiven the effects we\u2019ve already seen of 0.7 [degrees Celsius] of warming\u2014corals being wiped out, species dying, seabirds being affected\u2014it\u2019s staggering to imagine what will happen in the places that will see 10 times that much warming. It\u2019s frightening,\u201d he said. Bruno and his colleagues find that most tropical MPAs will exceed their \u201ccommunity thermal-safety margin\u201d\u2014a scientific term for the amount of heat that makes an entire ecosystem unsustainable\u2014just three decades from now. MPAs in more temperate areas will not exceed that margin, on average, until 2150. The study examined a specific climate scenario called RCP 8.5 , which assumes humanity will continue to emit more and more heat-trapping carbon pollution through the end of the century. It\u2019s unclear if that projection will come to pass\u2014and, of course, it all depends on how the world\u2019s richest governments (and their citizens) act. Global carbon emissions rose in 2017 , an ominous sign, after remaining flat for several years. Andrew King, a climate researcher at the University of Melbourne who was not involved in the study, said the MPA study was \u201cinteresting and very important\u201d: \u201cIt adds to the evidence that it is difficult to protect marine species in particular\u201d from the ravages of climate change, he told me in an email. \u201cCompared to land-based ecosystems, [marine species] have evolved to adapt to a narrower range of temperatures, so any warming becomes a problem more quickly.\u201d The new paper also raises two problems for conservationists\u2014one new and one old. First, the team\u2019s models suggest that the parts of the oceans that don\u2019t warm will suffer the worst of another environmental problem. Scientists predict that vast swaths of the ocean will lose their oxygen content as the century wears on, creating denuded \u201c dead zones .\u201d Bruno and his colleagues modeled this effect\u2014and they found many of the areas that are most vulnerable to deoxygenation are the same ones where warming is least likely. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an impossible trade-off,\u201d said Bruno. \u201cThe global pattern for deoxygenation is almost the opposite of the warming pattern. You can put [an MPA] in a place that won\u2019t warm, but then there\u2019s going to be less oxygen there, which is at least as big a problem as climate change.\u201d The second problem is a human problem, not a natural one. It\u2019s also more familiar to conservationists. For the last two decades, scientists have aimed to protect parts of the ocean that will resist global warming\u2014to find so-called refugia from warming. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge effort to figure out where warming isn\u2019t happening as fast and to move MPAs there, or put new MPAs there,\u201d Bruno said. \u201cWe\u2019re clearly not doing that.\u201d Warming refugia, Bruno and his colleagues found, didn\u2019t especially coincide with the placement of MPAs. And only 3.5 percent of the world\u2019s marine protected areas\u2014or fewer than 300 areas total\u2014will be protected from both future warming and deoxygenation. These results stunned even Bruno, who does much of his field research in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. The Gal\u00e1pagos, which sport famously unique wildlife, also give rise to an unusual climate. Even though the Gal\u00e1pagos are almost precisely equatorial\u2014they are, in fact, several hundred miles due west of Ecuador\u2014they have just a lukewarm climate. \u201cThere are penguins there. It\u2019s almost a temperate community,\u201d Bruno told me. Perhaps because of this, \u201cI was under the impression that they were not predicted to warm, that warming is not really an issue there,\u201d he said. But the model projected \u201creally severe warming\u201d\u20144 degrees Celsius of warming, or more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cThat really surprised us,\u201d he told me. It\u2019s not the last surprise that climate change has in store\u2014for scientists, for wildlife, or for the millions of humans that rely on the oceans every day.","headline":"Climate Change Could Destroy Even the Ocean's Most Pristine Parks","article_name":559757.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/conservation-projects-cant-stop-climate-change\/559757\/","date_published":"2018-05-07 17:21:00","article_length":5538,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:13.830376","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/conservation-projects-cant-stop-climate-change\/559757\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Scientists recently modeled a range of interactions between energy-intensive civilizations and their planets. The results were sobering. The universe does many things. It makes galaxies, comets, black holes, neutron stars, and a whole mess more. We\u2019ve lately discovered that it makes a great deal of planets, but it\u2019s not clear whether it regularly makes energy-hungry civilizations, nor is it clear whether such civilizations inevitably drive their planets into climate change. There\u2019s lots of hope riding on our talk about building a sustainable civilization on Earth. But how do we know that\u2019s even possible? Does anyone across the cosmos ever make it? Remarkably, science has now advanced to a point where we can take a first step at answering this question. I know this because my colleagues and I have just published a first study mapping out possible histories of alien planets, the civilizations they grow, and the climate change that follows. Our team was made up of astronomers, an earth scientist, and an urban ecologist. It was only half-jokingly that we thought of our study as a \u201ctheoretical archaeology of exo-civilizations.\u201d \u201cExo-civilizations\u201d are what people really mean when they talk about aliens. Astronomers refer to the new worlds they\u2019ve discovered as \u201cexoplanets.\u201d They\u2019re now gearing up to use the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments to search for life by looking for signs of \u201cexo-biospheres\u201d on those exoplanets. So if we have exoplanets and exo-biospheres, it\u2019s time to switch out the snicker-inducing word \u201caliens\u201d for the real focus of our concerns: exo-civilizations. We\u2019re interested in how exo-civilizations develop on their planets. Given that more than 10 billion trillion planets likely exist in the cosmos, unless nature is perversely biased against civilizations like ours, we\u2019re not the first one to appear. That means each exo-civilization that evolved from its planet\u2019s biosphere had a history: a story of emergence, rising capacities, and then maybe a slow fade or rapid collapse. And just as most species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct, so too most civilizations that emerged (if they emerged) may have long since ended. So we\u2019re exploring what may have happened to others to gain insights into what might happen to us. Of course, we have no direct evidence relating to any exo-civilizations or their histories. What we do have, however, are the laws of planets. Our robot emissaries have already visited most of the worlds in the solar system. We\u2019ve set up weather stations on Mars, watched the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, and seen rain cascade across methane lakes on Titan. From these worlds we learned the generic physics and chemistry that make up what\u2019s called climate. We can use these laws to predict the global response of any planet to something like an asteroid impact or perhaps the emergence of an energy-hungry industrial civilization. To launch our science of exo-civilizations we started with those laws of planets, building the right equations to capture the intertwined evolution of a planet and its young civilization. But planetary laws of physics and chemistry only tell part of the story. If we want to know the possible fates of other civilizations on other worlds, we had to bring some biology to bear too. Science fiction has given us enduring images of alien races. Not surprisingly, most of them look a lot like us but with different kinds of foreheads or ears, or a different number of fingers on their hands. In developing our first cut at a science of exo-civilizations, my collaborators and I weren\u2019t interested in what aliens might look like or what kind of sex they have. To do our job we had to avoid the specifics of both their individual biology and their sociology because science provides us little to work with on those fronts. There was, however, one place where biology was up to the task. Population biology was a radical new field back in the early 20th century. Rather than just collecting statistics to describe animal populations, a few ambitious researchers like Alfred Lotka wanted to create basic mathematical models of things like predators and prey to predict the evolution of their linked populations. Predators (like wolves) eat prey (like bunnies) so they can make more wolf babies, thereby increasing the wolf population. Bunnies do a fine job of reproducing on their own, but if too many are eaten, their population numbers suffer. Today, population biologists, ecologists, and their compatriots use mathematical models to study everything from the spread of disease to the propagation of invasive species. The approach has even found its way to the study of human civilizations, including their collapse in places like Easter Island. We used these tools to build a simple model for the evolution of a civilization with its planet. In our approach, the exo-civilization\u2019s population and the planetary environment are braided together by energy use and its consequences. The planet gives the civilization energy resources. The civilization consumes them to do the work of civilization building. As a civilization harvests more power from the planet, its capacities soar. That includes the ability to make and feed more babies. This link between available energy (in the form of food for simple organisms) and rising birth rates is fundamental to population biology. And for human civilization the steep rise we\u2019ve seen in population is closely tied to fertilizer involving fossil-fuel use. So greater energy will, in the beginning, mean bigger populations. But there\u2019s no free lunch from a planetary perspective. Using all that energy has to result in feedback on the planet. That\u2019s what we earthlings are just starting to see with climate change. If global warming gets really nasty, everything from energy harvesting to food production is going to get severely stressed and our large human population won\u2019t be sustainable. That\u2019s why our exo-civilization models linked rising planetary impacts with population declines. It was all pretty straightforward, requiring no assumptions about alien economics, sociology, or any other science-fiction ideas. But to allow for some choice on the part of the exo-civilization we also included a basic switch describing how the civilization could respond to changing planetary conditions. For the sake of simplicity, we imagined that the planet had just two kinds of energy resources. One had a high planetary impact (like fossil fuels). The other had low impact (like solar energy). In some models we allowed the civilization to switch from to one to the other as things got bad. So, what did the model tell us? We saw three distinct kinds of civilizational histories. The first\u2014and, alarmingly, most common\u2014was what we called \u201cthe die-off.\u201d As the civilization used energy, its numbers grew rapidly, but the use of the resource also pushed the planet away from the conditions the civilization grew up with. As the evolution of the civilization and planet continued, the population skyrocketed, blowing past the planet\u2019s limits. The population, in other words, overshot the planet\u2019s carrying capacity. Then came a big reduction in the civilization\u2019s population until both the planet and the civilization reached a steady state. After that the population and the planet stopped changing. A sustainable planetary civilization was achieved, but at a high cost. In many of the models, we saw as much as 70 percent of the population perish before a steady state was reached. In reality, it\u2019s not clear that a complex technological civilization like ours could survive such a catastrophe. In many ways we were seeing a kind of cosmic Easter Island play out. There may have been as many as 10,000 people living on Easter Island at the peak of its stone-head-making heyday. But by cutting down all the trees to roll the stone heads around, that civilization seems to have mucked up its ecosystem and sealed its own fate. When the Dutch arrived in 1722 only a few thousand folks, living greatly reduced lives, were left. The second kind of trajectory held the good news. We called it the \u201csoft landing.\u201d The population grew and the planet changed but together they made a smooth transition to new, balanced equilibrium. The civilization had changed the planet but without triggering a massive die-off. The final class of trajectory was the most worrisome: full-blown collapse. As in the die-off histories, the population blew up. But these planets just couldn\u2019t handle the avalanche of the civilization\u2019s impact. The host worlds were too sensitive to change, like a houseplant that withers when it\u2019s moved. Conditions on these planets deteriorated so fast the civilization\u2019s population nose-dived all the way to extinction. You might think switching from the high-impact energy source to the low-impact source would make things better. But for some trajectories, it didn\u2019t matter. If the civilization used only the high-impact resource, the population reached a peak and then quickly dropped to zero. But if we allowed the civilization to switch to the low-impact energy resource, the collapse still happened in certain cases, even if it was delayed. The population would start to fall, then happily stabilize. But then, finally and suddenly, it rushed downward to extinction. The collapses that occurred even when the civilization did the smart thing demonstrated an essential point about the modeling process. Because the equations capture some of the real world\u2019s complexity, they can surprise you. In some of the \u201cdelayed collapse\u201d histories, the planet\u2019s own internal machinery was the culprit. Push a planet too hard, and it won\u2019t return to where it began. We know this can happen, even without a civilization present, because we see it on Venus. That world should be a kind of sister to our own. But long ago Venus\u2019s greenhouse effect slipped into a runaway mode, driving its surface temperatures to a hellish 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Our models were showing, in generic terms, how a civilization could push a planet down the hill into a different kind of runaway through its own activity. The model we created was, however, just a first stab at a science of exo-civilizations. We made the equations a simple as possible while still capturing the essence of planet-civilization \u201ccoevolution.\u201d That means it\u2019s too early to answer the question, \u201cDoes anyone make it?\u201d Still, our work provides the basic contours of what might happen. We need to put in more detailed and realistic climate physics. We also need to include the full range of energy sources a young civilization might find on its home world\u2014the list is limited by physics: combustion, solar, wind, geothermal, tides, nuclear, and a few others. Even though our initial models were simple, they still revealed a radical truth about the challenge we face as we push the Earth into its human-dominated era. Unless the universe is deeply biased against it, there have been other civilizations across space and time that faced these challenges. Anthropocenes may be common. As I explore in my new book, Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth , our dawning realization that we are profoundly shaping Earth\u2019s future provides us with the impetus to stop acting like cosmic teenagers with power but little wisdom. From that perspective the true narrative of climate change isn\u2019t some small, local drama of Democrats vs. Republications or business interests vs. environmentalists. Instead, it\u2019s a cosmic test, one that gives us a chance to join those who successfully crossed this burning frontier\u2014or the chance to be consigned to the scrap heap of civilizations too shortsighted to take care of their own planet.","headline":"How Do Aliens Solve Climate Change?","article_name":561479.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/how-do-aliens-solve-climate-change\/561479\/","date_published":"2018-05-30 15:28:58","article_length":11756,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:13.887510","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/how-do-aliens-solve-climate-change\/561479\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It was supposed to be a quiet year. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be a bad year for Western wildfires. Last winter, a weak La Ni\u00f1a bloomed across the Pacific. It sent flume after flume of rain to North America and irrigated half the continent. Water penetrated deep into the soil of Western forests, and mammoth snowdrifts stacked up across the Sierra Nevadas. California\u2019s drought ended in the washout. Yet fires are now raging across the West. More than two dozen named fires currently burn across Washington and Oregon. More than one million acres have burned in Montana , an area larger than Rhode Island, in the Treasure State\u2019s third-worst fire season on record. And the largest brushfire in the history of Los Angeles currently threatens hundreds of homes in Burbank. Canada may be experiencing an even worse year for wildfires: 2.86 million acres have burned in British Columbia, the largest area ever recorded in the province. So what happened? How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer\u2019s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July , and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August. \u201cThis will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires,\u201d says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms. \u201cThe last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems),\u201d said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, in an email. \u201cI was running a few numbers this morning, and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain.\u201d This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming, Williams said. \u201cNow, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And there\u2019s a heat wave on top of that,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBecause of the exponential influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.\u201d In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming, wildfires are a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d for the effects of climate change, Williams said. And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire. In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming. \u201cThe added forest fire area\u2014due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming\u2014equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined,\u201d Williams told me. Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. A paper published in Science last year found that \u201clarge wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.\u201d The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt. The same team of researchers also found that the area of annual burned forest in the Pacific Northwest has increased by nearly 5000 percent since the early 1970s. Fires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change. In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible. This has caused denser and more fire-prone forests than the long-term average for the West, which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires. People have also lengthened the season by starting fires\u2014through errant fireworks, unattended campfires, or arson\u2014earlier in the spring and later in the fall. In a human-free environment, fires could only start after a lightning strike, which only follow from summertime thunderstorms. \u201cSince the 1980s, we\u2019ve only burnt about 10 percent of the western U.S. forests. And that number to me means that there\u2019s still a whole lot more to burn,\u201d Williams said. He estimated that it would take another several decades for that excess century of fuel to burn out of the American woods. And in the meantime, the planet will only get hotter. \u201cAccording to climate models, by the end of this century, the western United States is still projected to warm by about another 3.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd when we remember that the relationship between temperature and fire is exponential ... we\u2019re really talking about a very different western United States in 50 years.\u201d","headline":"Has Climate Change Intensified 2017\u2019s Western Wildfires?","article_name":539130.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/09\/why-is-2017-so-bad-for-wildfires-climate-change\/539130\/","date_published":"2017-09-07 18:57:38","article_length":5573,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:14.988726","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/09\/why-is-2017-so-bad-for-wildfires-climate-change\/539130\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The Clean Power Plan is in bad shape, but the planet might not be. That might be overstating the case. Some advocates had hoped that even before the Clean Power Plan kicked in in 2022, it would shape how energy markets worked . The EPA could regulate, the story went, through the power of positive thinking . Some of this is still true: Renewable energy will keep getting cheaper , and U.S. coal companies are doomed no matter what . But the Court\u2019s stay diminishes that effect, at least in the short term. November\u2019s presidential election will now either ratify or ruin Obama\u2019s fight to mitigate climate change. No remaining Republican candidate for president supports imposing federal limits on greenhouse-gas emissions . If the GOP takes the White House, it could drop the case, and use its control of the executive and legislative branch to help fossil fuel companies by offering subsidies. But if Democrats manage to retain the presidency, and a future administration defends the deal, then a significant chunk of Obama\u2019s climate legacy will be left to the Supreme Court to decide . Should climate-concerned people really still trust the Clean Power Plan will all work out then? And if Obama\u2019s EPA regulations die, will the global accord on climate that he fought for perish too? Not everyone is zen about the Supreme Court\u2019s stay. Seth Jaffe, the former president of the American College of Environmental Lawyers , had predicted in December the Court would not stay the regulation . When it did, earlier this week, he took it as a sign of doom. The Clean Power Plan \u201cis on very shaky ground at this point,\u201d he wrote . \u201cOne has to conclude that five justices have decided that the rule must go,\u201d he said . The terms of the stay are so extraordinary, so unusual, that it means something is up. \u201cI hope [the advocates of the regulation] win, but my neutral-objective-advice side says this is a hard one for them,\u201d he told me on Thursday. \u201cThe advocates can talk all they want about how they have deference, and the Supreme Court has given deference to the EPA in the past. But this really is a big rule that is largely unprecedented.\u201d Deference is the idea that the courts should give federal agencies some leeway in executing their regulatory duties. In the last 30 years, deference has been applied to labor law and net neutrality , but it takes its name from a 1984 case about the Clean Air Act \u2014the same piece of legislation that the EPA is using today. What\u2019s legally controversial with the Clean Power Plan is its two-step approach. First, the plan sets regulatory limits on the amount of carbon dioxide that state electricity plants can emit. Second, it establishes a set of incentives and regulations\u2014it calls them \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d\u2014to entice state utilities to switch away from coal-fire power generation toward natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables. The first step of those two steps\u2014the one that explicitly concerns carbon dioxide\u2014accounts for less than a quarter of the plan\u2019s estimated emissions reductions. The second step clears out all the rest, millions and millions of tons of prevented carbon dioxide. It\u2019s this second step, and those second-order effects, that opponents allege the EPA doesn\u2019t have the authority to set in motion. The Clean Power Plan draws its legal authority from Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Recently, a climate-focused legal team at Columbia University proposed that a different part of the law could let the EPA set up new regulations if the Clean Power Plan falls. This section lets the EPA regulate air pollutants if it works with other countries, something that\u2014ka-ching!\u2014it\u2019s doing through the Paris Agreement. Jaffe isn\u2019t so sure about this technique, since the Paris Agreement isn\u2019t legally binding. Three large American environmental groups said that, at least in the short term, the stay was unlikely to doom the Paris Agreement. ( In a post on Wednesday , I worried that it would.) \u201cI think the big picture here is that all countries have their own national circumstances that they have to address as they fashion their own response to climate change. And no country\u2019s political and legal issues are as well understood as the United States,\u201d said John Coequyt , the director of federal and international climate campaigns at the Sierra Club. Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said he had been talking to climate negotiators around the world and \u201cthere seems to be general understanding that this a procedural ruling.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of nervousness that we\u2019re seeing a repeat of the Kyoto Protocol, where the world accommodated U.S. concerns and then saw it not implement it,\u201d said Meyer. But he said other countries were expressing \u201ca general willingness to wait and see how this plays out in the month to come.\u201d He added that other nations wanted the United States to affirm the Paris Agreement by signing it on Earth Day, April 22. Even if the Clean Power Plan falls, there\u2019s some signs that America may make its 2025 emissions target anyway. The Sierra Club believes its own efforts, specifically its super successful Beyond Coal program, will allow the U.S. to comply with its Paris Agreement pledge regardless of what the EPA does. Thanks to the Beyond Coal campaign, \u201cabout a third of U.S. coal plans are retired or scheduled for retirement,\u201d Coequyt said. The Obama administration is also pressing down on emissions by regulating other greenhouse-gas sources, such as airplanes, landfills, and natural-gas harvesters. The EPA has also tightened its national ambient-air-quality standards , which will make running coal plants even more expensive and utilities less likely to build them. And in December , Congress extended a pre-existing tax credits for renewable energy companies to 2020. \u201cU.S. emissions are declining,\u201d Coequyt told me. \u201cThe main factors driving that change have been things other than the Clean Power Plan up until now. If things had not been going well, and the story was the U.S. is going to turn things around with the Clean Power Plan, this would be a big deal.\u201d But local advocacy, air-pollution rules, and cheap natural gas means that it isn\u2019t. Many utilities plan to move forward on natural-gas and clean-energy plans no matter what happens . And Obama\u2019s policies remain popular: Back in November, two-thirds of Americans and a \u201cbare majority of Republicans\u201d said they supported regulating carbon-dioxide emissions through domestic policy,  according to a poll from The New York Times and CBS . So the positive trends on climate change will largely continue\u2014unless, that is, a Republican wins the White House and moves to reverse them.","headline":"Did the Supreme Court Doom the Paris Climate Change Deal?","article_name":462294.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2016\/02\/the-parts-of-obamas-climate-legacy-that-will-survive\/462294\/","date_published":"2016-02-12 17:31:55","article_length":6694,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:15.826613","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2016\/02\/the-parts-of-obamas-climate-legacy-that-will-survive\/462294\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Meet the \u201ceco-right.\u201d Not everyone interested in curbing climate change is tearing their hair out about Donald Trump's election. Though the president-elect seems to be packing his administration with climate deniers and fossil fuel industry veterans, a small, unconventional band of environmentalists sees potential. \u201cWe hope,\u201d says Bob Inglis, \u201cthat Donald Trump sees an opportunity to complete the sentence this way: Richard Nixon went to China, Bill Clinton signed welfare reform, and Donald Trump did climate change.\u201d In the last several years, Inglis\u2014a former Congressman from South Carolina\u2014has emerged as a spokesperson of sorts for \u201cthe eco-right,\u201d a suite of think tanks, activists and politicos making the case for a free-market approach to environmentalism, grounded in conservative values. He now serves as the Executive Director of RepublicEn, a small advocacy outfit of self-described \u201cenergy optimists,\u201d keen to dispel rumors that the GOP is the province of climate denialism. Inglis\u2019s optimism notwithstanding, climate-change activists have ample reason to fear a Trump administration. The president-elect\u2019s pick to run the EPA has spent years challenging the agency in court. And his Secretary of State nominee, the former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, could green light new cross-border pipelines like the Keystone XL, along with new partnerships between oil companies from Houston to Moscow. A previously squashed $500 billion Arctic oil deal between Exxon and Rosneft, a state-run Russian oil firm, might well be on the table again if Trump lifts Obama-era sanctions against the country. For Inglis and his colleagues at RepublicEN, though, the cabinet picks causing other greens to lose sleep have been welcome additions. \u201cIf Rex Tillerson led Exxon Mobil away from the disputation of climate science, perhaps he can lead the Administration away from disputation too,\u201d Inglis says, and he takes Tillerson's support for a carbon tax as an encouraging sign. When it comes to climate action, Inglis adds, the \u201cenvironmental left\u201d\u2014encompassing everyone from Al Gore to anti-fracking activists\u2014have been steering the conversation about climate change for too long. It\u2019s time to \u201clet ExxonMobil drive,\u201d he says. Inglis might seem out of step with the climate movement\u2019s increasingly anti-corporate bent, defined by efforts like fossil-fuel divestment and the battle against the Dakota Access pipeline. But members of the eco-right see little contradiction between fossil-fuel companies\u2019 bottom-lines and a low-carbon future. Like other members of the eco-right, Inglis believes that efficient markets are the ultimate problem solver, and he has a general skepticism about all but the most basic of regulations. \u201cThe essence of [the eco-right] is all about internalizing negative externalities,\u201d Inglis says, referencing the hidden expenses of carbon\u2019s seepage into the atmosphere. He says that polluters are \u201csocializing their soot and climate costs.\u201d By making them pay and stripping out all energy subsidies, the thinking goes, firms will shift their business models accordingly, weeding out wasteful fuels, making the Paris Agreement and Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan superfluous. \u201cOur view of the Clean Power Plan is that it\u2019s precisely the worst way to deal with climate change,\u201d Inglis explains. UN agreements and regulatory pushes, Inglis argues, represent the kind of policies which keep conservatives out of the conversation on climate, because they are both too complicated and too confrontational. \u201cI think the path in is mostly through the business community, where unlikely partners could really step forward and say, \u2018There\u2019s a free enterprise solution to this. Don\u2019t give us regulations. Don\u2019t try to tell us how to run our business. Just internalize the negative externality and we will deal with it,\u2019\u201d he says. The holy grail of Inglis\u2019s brand of eco-conservatism is a \u201crevenue-neutral, border-adjustable\u201d carbon tax. This kind of pricing mechanism offers a more elegant solution to the eco-right than the patchwork of regulations involved in Obama\u2019s landmark climate rule, wherein each state arrives at its own plan. Greens across the political spectrum have long backed versions of a carbon tax as part of a broader slate of emissions-cutting policies, some proposals for which would see dividends given out directly to taxpayers or put toward investments in clean energy. What\u2019s unique about the eco-right position on the tax is their view that it should act as the centerpiece of a climate plan, as opposed to one component among many market-based and regulatory measures. In contrast, when Bernie Sanders and his \u201cenvironmental left\u201d ilk advocate for pricing carbon, they tend also to favor putting hard limits on polluters\u2019 ability to spit greenhouse gases into the air. Key, too, to the eco-right is swapping a carbon tax out for others\u2014say income or corporate taxes\u2014rather than adding the revenue to government coffers. \u201cYou put a tax on things that you want less of,\u201d Inglis says, while allowing the price signal to drive carbon-intensive firms toward natural gas and renewable energy. Importers to the U.S. would also be forced to account for the carbon costs of goods produced abroad. Carbon taxes don\u2019t have the best track record. Norway set a reasonably high carbon tax way back in 1991, yet the country\u2019s emissions fell by just 2.3 percent from 1990 to 1999. In British Columbia, where a tax was implemented in 2008, modest emissions reductions have been traced back to the fallout from the Great Recession rather than the tax itself. It\u2019s not clear how a new tax would affect corporate behavior. Oil majors have been factoring the likelihood of a price on carbon into their long-term financial planning for some time. Exxon first started accounting for a tax in 2007, setting its estimations for a price as high as $80 per ton in some regions. The company\u2019s own spokesperson told the Houston Chronicle in 2016 that curbing warming to a 1.6 degree target\u2014\u201cwell below two degrees,\u201d per the Paris Agreement\u2019s text\u2014would drive the cost of carbon up to $2000 per ton, far beyond the level set out in any proposal currently on the table. A failed carbon tax measure in Washington state, for example, would have started the tax at just $10 per ton in 2017, and gradually scaled up to $100 by mid-century. Among the countries already taxing carbon, Australia\u2019s fee is the equivalent of $23 per metric ton. Chile\u2019s will be set at just $5 per ton when it takes effect in 2018, and apply to just 55 percent of emissions. Sweden has one of the highest carbon prices at $150 per ton. It doesn't apply, however, to the country\u2019s electric power providers, and major industries pay about half of the standard tax. Exxon\u2019s Alan Jeffers affirmed the company\u2019s commitment to a revenue-neutral carbon tax in an email to The Atlantic. Among the state and federal proposals the company had studied, Jeffers wrote,  \u201cThe most significant common shortcoming is their failure to pre-empt existing greenhouse gas regulations. The pre-emption issue is important because a properly-designed carbon tax that replaces the existing regime of emissions regulations would be a beneficial policy rationalization.\u201d In simpler terms, an Exxon-friendly carbon tax shouldn\u2019t just avoid regulations. It should dismantle them, and place as little strain as possible on the company\u2019s operations. Exxon has gone so far as to back the Paris Agreement and its ambitious warming target. Even so, regulatory caps on warming\u2014and strict ones at that\u2014may be the only path to meeting them. A recent study from Oil Change International  estimates that nearly 70 percent of already-developed coal, oil and natural gas reserves\u2014not counting the ones fossil-fuel firms are keen to start mining\u2014have to stay buried in perpetuity for a reasonable chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees celsius, the \u201cguardrail\u201d of acceptable warming that the international community agreed to in Paris. To do that, the historical record seems to favor regulatory action over price signals alone. In contrast to British Columbia\u2019s 5.3 percent reduction post-tax, Ontario\u2019s climate plan was able to scale down emissions by nearly twenty percent over a similar time frame. In large part, they did it by phasing out and then banning coal-fired power plants. Asked if climate policy might need to pose a threat to oil industry profits at some point, Inglis suggested that threat would come instead from Tesla, Elon Musk\u2019s luxury electric car company. Inglis reasons that if fossil fuels truly are inefficient, the better product will win out on an open market. But it\u2019s not clear that Tesla will win in the mass market any time soon. The Model 3, the company\u2019s first \u201cmass market\u201d car, intended to be more affordable than its others, will be released next year and start at $35,000. More than 56 percent of American families, meanwhile, have less than $1000 in the bank. Eli Lehrer is another member of the eco-right looking to harness the power of the free market to save the planet. Back in 2012, Lehrer helped lead an exodus of insurance wonks out of the conservative and notoriously climate change-skeptical Heartland Institute. The final straw for him at Heartland was their sponsorship of a series of billboards likening those who believe in climate change to the likes of Charles Manson and Osama bin Laden. As an insurance analyst trained to assess risk, Lehrer could no longer square his research interests with his employer\u2019s aggressive stance against climate science. He now heads R Street, another think tank produced out of the spin-off. Even if a carbon tax fails to bring down emissions, he says, \u201cit\u2019s still good tax policy.\u201d In 2016, the GOP\u2019s climate politics are more complicated than they might look at first glance, with growing divides between voters and elected officials. Along with Inglis and Lehrer, 54 percent of Republicans now believe that the climate is changing and that humankind has played a hand in it. By contrast, just 14 of the 247 Republicans in the House of Representatives signed on to the Gibson Resolution, stating the urgency of climate change and the body\u2019s commitment to addressing it. As Lehrer notes, even if Republicans\u2019 base is starting to believe in climate change, it is still a long way off from becoming a top line issue. For Republicans, in fact, climate change was this year\u2019s least important issue, according to Gallup. In spite of the polling, Lehrer sees state-level efforts at a carbon tax as \u201cvery likely in the next four to eight years.\u201d If there is to be progress in bringing down emissions under Trump at the federal level, though, Lehrer predicts it will come via policies that have very little to do with the climate outright. \u201cSome of the things that the administration seems to have said it will do seem to be pretty good from a climate change perspective,\u201d Lehrer says, \u201cin particular\u2026increased natural gas development, support for nuclear power and pipelines.\u201d Natural gas development, he and the American Petroleum Institute argue, has been key to bringing down emissions in the United States. Yet while natural gas emits relatively little CO2, scientists say that fracking\u2019s low carbon cost is overshadowed by the amount of methane the process spews into the atmosphere. (As a greenhouse gas, methane is about twenty times as potent as carbon dioxide.) As for pipelines, Lehrer contends they are a safer and more carbon-efficient means of transporting fossil fuels, as compared to train lines. Still, building pipelines in the first place requires that there be fresh batches of oil to flow through them, which means more greenhouse gases. \u201cCan I predict what he\u2019s going to do? No, I don\u2019t think anybody can,\u201d Lehrer wrote  of the president-elect in an email to The Atlantic . \u201cI would not be totally surprised if he were to give some speech announcing that [climate change] was a major crisis, announcing a new Manhattan Project to deal with it. And I\u2019d be equally unsurprised if he reiterated his comment that it\u2019s a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\u201d","headline":"The Republicans Who Want Trump to Fight Climate Change","article_name":512111.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/green-republican\/512111\/","date_published":"2017-01-04 13:00:00","article_length":12088,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:16.610844","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/green-republican\/512111\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate deniers threw all their might at disproving the famous climate change graph. Here's why they failed. Back in 1998, a little known climate scientist named Michael Mann and two colleagues published a paper that sought to reconstruct the planet's past temperatures going back half a millennium before the era of thermometers--thereby showing just how out of whack recent warming has been. The finding: Recent northern hemisphere temperatures had been \"warmer than any other year since (at least) AD 1400.\" The graph depicting this result looked rather like a hockey stick: After a long period of relatively minor temperature variations (the \"shaft\"), it showed a sharp mercury upswing during the last century or so (\"the blade\"). And then all hell broke loose. Mann tells the full story of the hockey stick--and the myriad unsuccessful attacks on it--in his 2012 book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines ; Mann will appear at a Climate Desk Live event on May 15 to discuss this saga. But to summarize a very complex history of scientific and political skirmishes in a few paragraphs: The hockey stick was repeatedly attacked, and so was Mann himself. Congress got involved, with demands for Mann's data and other information, including a computer code used in his research. Then the National Academy of Sciences weighed in in 2006, vindicating the hockey stick as good science and noting: \"The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on ice caps and the retreat of glaciers around the world.\" It didn't change the minds of the deniers, though--and soon Mann and his colleagues were drawn into the 2009 \" Climategate \" pseudo-scandal, which purported to reveal internal emails that (among other things) seemingly undermined the hockey stick. Only, they didn't. In the meantime, those wacky scientists kept doing what they do best--finding out what's true. As Mann relates, over the years other researchers were able to test his work using \"more extensive datasets, and more sophisticated methods. And the bottom line conclusion doesn't change.\" Thus the single hockey stick gradually became what Mann calls a \"hockey team.\" \"If you look at all the different groups, there are literally about two dozen\" hockey sticks now, he says. Mother Jones ' Jaeah Lee traced the strange evolution of the hockey stick story in this video: So what does it all mean? Well, here's the millennial scale irony: Climate deniers threw everything they had at the hockey stick. They focused immense resources on what they thought was the Achilles Heel of global warming research--and even then, they couldn't hobble it. (Though they certainly sowed plenty of doubt in the mind of the public.) What's more, even if they'd succeeded, in a scientific sense it wouldn't have even mattered. \"Climate deniers like to make it seem like the entire weight of evidence for climate change rests on the hockey stick,\" explains Mann. \"And that's not the case. We could get rid of all these reconstructions, and we could still know that climate change is a threat, and that we're causing it.\" The basic case for global warming caused by humans rests on basic physics--and, basic thermometer readings from around the globe. The hockey stick, in contrast, is the result of a field of research called paleoclimatology (the study of past climates) that, while fascinating, only provides one thread of evidence among many for what we're doing to the planet. Meanwhile, the hockey stick's blade doesn't just stop rising of its own accord. It's just going to go up, and up, and up, as the image above, combining the Marcott hockey stick with projections of where temperatures are headed by 2100, plainly shows. When he shows that graph to audiences, says Mann, \"I often hear an audible gasp.\" In this sense, the hockey stick does indeed matter--for it dramatizes just how much human irresponsibility, in a relatively short period of time, can devastate the only home we have.","headline":"The Hockey Stick: The Most Controversial Chart in Science, Explained","article_name":275753.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/05\/the-hockey-stick-the-most-controversial-chart-in-science-explained\/275753\/","date_published":"2013-05-10 15:34:06","article_length":4326,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:17.502615","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/05\/the-hockey-stick-the-most-controversial-chart-in-science-explained\/275753\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Boris Johnson has faced his share of blame for the country\u2019s death count. But the British system was failing long before the coronavirus struck. F aced with the coronavirus pandemic, Britain\u2019s leaders asked their people to do three things, captured in one pithy slogan: \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d On the first of those edicts, Britons largely followed through. Main streets, town centers, and public spaces were mostly abandoned, and the government pulled together a far-reaching job-protection program, ensuring that those who feared losing their jobs felt safe enough to not go to work. The second request was more unusual. During the pandemic, Britain was the only major country in the world to make protecting its National Health Service a central goal. Signs and placards went up outside people\u2019s homes, declaring their appreciation. The words Thank You NHS can now be seen on sidewalks and soccer jerseys, in children\u2019s bedrooms and even, until recently, the windows of 10 Downing Street. In part, this worked. The NHS adapted to the crisis at extraordinary speed, creating the emergency capacity required to deal with the surge of patients. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from the hospital after contracting COVID-19, he said that Britain was winning its battle against the disease because the public had \u201cformed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset,\u201d the NHS. On the third count, however, the country did not succeed, certainly compared with almost any other developed nation. Britain did not save as many lives as others. It had the money, the tools, and the wherewithal to respond as well as any, yet more of its people died than anywhere else in Europe. Britain has not been alone in its failure to prevent mass casualties\u2014almost every country on the Continent suffered appalling losses\u2014but one cannot avoid the grim reality spelled out in the numbers: If almost all countries failed, then Britain failed more than most. The raw figures are grim. Britain has the worst overall COVID-19 death toll in Europe, with more than 46,000 dead according to official figures, while also suffering the Continent\u2019s second-worst \u201cexcess death\u201d tally per capita, more than double that in France and eight times higher than Germany\u2019s. It did not protect its oldest and most vulnerable, who died in nursing homes in appalling numbers. It allowed the disease to spread throughout the country rather than isolating it in one area. It failed to close its borders in good time, abandoned contact tracing too early, set targets that were missed, designed government programs that didn\u2019t work, and somehow contrived to let the three most senior figures overseeing its pandemic response, including the prime minister, catch the very virus they were fighting. Now it faces the worst recession of any developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , and is once again taking a gamble by easing its lockdown at a relatively early stage . Read: The meaning of Boris Johnson\u2019s illness Much of the focus has been on Johnson: an apparent manifestation of all that has gone wrong in Britain, a caricature of imperial nostalgia, Trumpian populism, and a general lack of seriousness. Yet this was not simply an issue of inept political leadership, inept or otherwise: Johnson stuck closely to a strategy designed and endorsed by the government\u2019s experts, leaders in their fields and respected internationally. Even if the prime minister did make serious mistakes, the country\u2019s issues run far deeper. The British government as a whole made poorer decisions, based on poorer advice, founded on poorer evidence, supplied by poorer testing, with the inevitable consequence that it achieved poorer results than almost any of its peers. It failed in its preparation, its diagnosis, and its treatment. As prime minister, Johnson must accept that Britain\u2019s failures are his as well. Still, the difficult truth is that the country\u2019s failures clearly go beyond Johnson. They were collective, multilayered, and deadly. The most difficult question about all this is also the simplest: Why? To try to answer that question, I spoke with leading politicians, including a former prime minister and five former cabinet ministers; three experts who either sit on the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee for responding to pandemics, SAGE, or have briefed it during the crisis; half a dozen influential officials working in Downing Street and the NHS; and specialists associated with the government\u2019s response, including professors of epidemiology, mathematics, history, and psychology. I also interviewed diplomats and officials from Britain and other European governments to understand what assessments were being made outside the country. Those in sensitive positions mostly asked for anonymity to be able to speak frankly. What emerges is a picture of a country whose systemic weaknesses were exposed with appalling brutality, a country that believed it was stronger than it was, and that paid the price for failures that have built up for years. At the start of 2020, Britain had been through 10 years of austerity following the 2008 financial crash\u2014another great international crisis that hit the country harder than almost anywhere else. The NHS was stretched and fragmented, its lines of authority and responsibility tangled by years of regulatory tinkering. Outside London, the country\u2019s economy was unproductive and poor, and its elderly-care system an unreformed national disgrace. The civil service, which believed itself to be the best in the world, had become a shadow of its former self, almost entirely shorn of the ability to act operationally or think strategically, its center hollowed out, weak, and ineffective. The country itself seemed divided and angry, unable to agree on a unifying national story. But step back and an even bleaker image is revealed. In the past two decades, the list of British calamities, policy misjudgments, and forecasting failures has been eye-watering: the disaster of Iraq, the botched Libyan intervention in 2011, the near miss of Scottish independence in 2014, the woeful handling of Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union from 2016 onward. As one senior British government adviser put it to me, \u201cWe\u2019ve had our arse handed to us recently.\u201d When the pandemic hit, then, Britain was not the strong, successful, resilient country it imagined, but a poorly governed and fragile one. The truth is, Britain was sick before it caught the coronavirus. Like America, the country failed to live up to its reputation as a pillar of pandemic readiness. But unlike America, Britain\u2019s political leadership stuck closely to the script experts had drawn up for it\u2014and the country still struggled. In remarks echoed, though perhaps not as colorfully, by politicians, officials, and diplomats, one figure close to Johnson told me of his experience at the heart of the government machine these past few months: \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking disgrace.\u201d B ritain\u2019s pandemic story is not all bad. The NHS is almost universally seen as having risen to the challenge; the University of Oxford is leading the race to develop the first coronavirus vaccine for international distribution, backed with timely and significant government cash; new hospitals were built and treatments discovered with extraordinary speed; the welfare system did not collapse, despite the enormous pressure it suddenly faced; and a national economic safety net was rolled out quickly. It is also too early to say precisely why, epidemiologically, Britain suffered more deaths than other comparable countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Some government officials and experts I spoke with\u2014including a senior adviser to the leader of one of the best-performing countries in Europe\u2014said that Britain may have just been unlucky in the number of holidaymakers it had returning from the wrong places at the wrong times. Britain is also more densely populated than almost any other country in Europe, with its preeminent city and busiest airport. Like a Silk Road port at the time of the plague, London is a 21st-century global hub unlike anywhere else in the region. It is no coincidence that the British capital and New York have been among the two worst-affected cities in the world. Today, the scale of infection in Britain has been brought into line with that of the rest of Europe. The primary concern now being raised in London is the prospect of a second spike in Europe rather than Britain\u2014which may or may not prove hubristic in time. Either way, one cannot definitively judge the overall success or failure of a country\u2019s response for months, or even years, to come. The final verdict will be influenced by when a vaccine is found\u2014if at all\u2014as well as each country\u2019s ability to bounce back socially and economically. Already, according to conversations I had with officials inside 10 Downing Street, the government believes that the economic recovery will soon be more important to the public\u2019s perception of British competence than the death count. Yet no one I spoke with, Johnson friend or foe, claimed that Britain\u2019s response to date could reasonably be described as anything other than disappointing\u2014too many people have died for it to be anything else. One influential U.K. government official told me that although individual mistakes always happen in a fast-moving crisis, and had clearly taken place in Britain\u2019s response to COVID-19, it was impossible to escape the conclusion that Britain was simply not ready. As Ian Boyd, a professor and member of SAGE, put it: \u201cThe reality is, there has been a major systemic failure.\u201d The majority of those I spoke with\u2014even those close to Johnson and the government\u2019s effort to contain the pandemic\u2014agreed that, in hindsight, the prime minister and his most senior health and scientific advisers made serious missteps. Most also agreed that on top of poor decisions was poor management as parts of the system became overwhelmed and, as one senior U.K. official involved in the government\u2019s pandemic response said, simply collapsed. The civil service appeared unprepared for the scale of the task: One official close to Johnson told me that the Cabinet Office\u2014the department that coordinates with all others for the prime minister\u2014went through multiple organizational restructures during the pandemic, signaling its lack of readiness. The senior U.K. official recounted how, in some meetings, staffers had to tally total COVID-19 case counts on their smartphones based on figures scribbled on whiteboards hastily dragged into Downing Street, because the country lacked a well-connected data system. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the British state was not prepared for\u201d the pandemic, this official told me. \u201cBut, even worse, many parts of the state thought they were prepared, which is significantly more dangerous.\u201d When the crisis came, too much of Britain\u2019s core infrastructure simply failed, according to senior officials and experts involved in the pandemic response. Expert advisory committees proved too slow and ponderous, with not enough dissenting voices; crisis-response cells could not cope and had to be bypassed; the Cabinet Office buckled under the strain; the NHS had no adequate way of sharing data; authorities could not meet the sudden need for mass testing; the Foreign Office could not get people home fast enough ; the Department of Health could not design a contact-tracing app that worked; the government overall could not sufficiently procure key pandemic equipment; and Downing Street generally gave the impression of lurching from one crisis to another. \u201cPeople will look back and say, \u2018Could we have done it earlier?\u2019 and with the power of retrospectroscope, which is an infinitely powerful instrument, the answer to that is, probably,\u201d Mark Walport, who like Boyd sits on SAGE, told me. But Walport said this was not the fundamental issue of the crisis. \u201cMany of the challenges that we\u2019ve had are not, as it were, about policy advice or the science advice; they are questions about resilience.\u201d Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s most influential adviser, has used the analogy of the human immune system to explain what he believes is wrong with the British state, which he says has become too static. The immune system, Cummings argues, has no plan or central control; it is adaptable, and therefore stronger. He is only half right. The human immune system actually has two parts. There is, as Cummings correctly identifies, the adaptive part. But there is also an innate part, preprogrammed as the first line of defense against infectious disease. Humans need both. The same is true of a state and its government, said those I spoke with\u2014many of whom were sympathetic to Cummings\u2019s diagnosis. Without a functioning structure, the responsive antibodies of the government and its agencies cannot learn on the job. When the pandemic hit, both parts of Britain\u2019s immune system were found wanting. B y the time Johnson chaired his first emergency coronavirus meeting, on March 2, Britain had officially recorded 39 cases . The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, had been subject to a brutal lockdown, while other places had experienced epidemics of their own. Northern Italy was about to become the first European disaster zone. Yet in London, officials insisted there was no need to panic. Britain, it seemed, had time to ready itself, lagging a few weeks behind Italy, and was well prepared to weather the storm: The country was ranked second in the world for its preparedness against biological threats, behind only the United States, and had spent years preparing for a pandemic. It had the institutional structures in place to advise the prime minister, the health system to handle an outbreak, and the expertise to arrive at the right decisions. The true extent of Britain\u2019s outbreak at that point, we now know, was likely much worse than the official figures, with cases brought back to the country from multiple parts of the world\u2014seeds planted in the fertile soil of a heavily populated, globally connected economy. On March 3, journalists\u2014including me\u2014were called into Downing Street for a briefing setting out Britain\u2019s strategy. Government advisers made clear that although they had not given up hope that the virus could be contained internationally, Britain could not do so alone. The country\u2019s experts told us then that any steps taken to slow the spread of the disease domestically needed to be timed intelligently, to ensure that they covered the peak of the crisis. If a lockdown were ordered too early, it would suppress the disease and save lives in the short term, but only delay the inevitable outbreak, and potentially make it worse by pushing it into the winter, a time when flu-related illnesses also peak, or to a point when public willingness to endure such severe social-isolation measures had run its course. This remains a concern. The government\u2019s job, as its leaders saw it, was to ensure that the most vulnerable members of society were protected and that the spread slowed to ensure that hospitals could cope. This was not the response among Asian countries, which experienced outbreaks before Britain but nevertheless sought to permanently defeat the virus. South Korea, for example, instituted widespread testing, alongside a contact-tracing regime to keep the disease at bay until a vaccine could be found. Many others in the region adopted masks en masse. Travel restrictions were put in place. Lockdowns, large and small, were implemented. Read: The U.K.\u2019s coronavirus \u2018herd immunity\u2019 debacle Like much of the Western world, Britain had prepared for an influenza pandemic, whereas places that were hit early\u2014Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan\u2014had readied themselves for the type of respiratory illness that COVID-19 proved to be. \u201cThere was a bit too much exceptionalism about how brilliant British science was at the start of this outbreak, which ended up with a blind spot about what was happening in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, where we just weren\u2019t looking closely enough, and they turned out to be the best in the world at tackling the coronavirus,\u201d a former British cabinet minister told me. The focus on influenza pandemics and the lack of a tracing system were compounded by a shortfall in testing capacity. According to a report on the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic by Lawrence Freedman, a war-studies professor emeritus at King\u2019s College London, Britain\u2019s original plan was overwhelmed by the speed of the pandemic, which it did not fully understand until it was too late\u2014an account supported by the experts I spoke with. If there had been more testing capacity, not only would the government have stood a better chance at tracing those with the disease, but it would have been better informed about the spread of the virus in general, and may therefore have ordered the lockdown earlier. Even doing so by a small amount of time would have made a difference. Neil Ferguson, one of the country\u2019s leading epidemiologists, told lawmakers in June that Britain\u2019s death toll could have been halved had the lockdown, which began March 23, been imposed a week earlier (though this was not SAGE\u2019s advice at the time). Still, this narrow focus on when recommendations were given, and whether it was the best advice, runs the risk of appearing to absolve Johnson of blame\u2014if the system is at fault, then no one person could have salvaged it. And his insistence that he was following experts\u2019 advice masks the inherently political choices all leaders must make in times of crisis. Other leaders, supported by other systems, arrived at better decisions more quickly than Britain. On March 10, restrictions began to be imposed in Berlin, a decision that Freedman concludes was a significant factor in Germany\u2019s overall success. Leaders in France and Italy enacted more stringent restrictions in their cities and countries, and suffered fewer deaths. One of the central criticisms of Johnson\u2019s leadership\u2014expressed to me in multiple conversations\u2014is not a refusal to accept the truth (the charge of many international observers, including Barack Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, lumping him in with populists such as Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro) but a failure to challenge his experts\u2019 strategy. It was the prime minister\u2019s duty to question the scientific advice, to demand more. This is not a critique made solely in hindsight: On March 12, Rory Stewart, a former Conservative lawmaker who took on Johnson for the party leadership last year, set out the reasons Johnson needed to follow Merkel\u2019s lead. \u201cThe key thing to understand in any emergency response is that you need to make a judgment,\u201d he said then. Stewart said Johnson needed to take responsibility and argued it was \u201cdeeply, deeply unfair\u201d to claim that Britain followed the experts\u2019 plan, not his own. To a large extent, Johnson\u2019s hope and trust in his advisers was understandable: A Downing Street official asked me to imagine the outrage if the prime minister had been accused of overruling scientific and medical advisers early in the crisis. Still, Johnson\u2019s strategy throughout was one that his hero Winston Churchill raged against during the First World War, when he concluded that generals had been given too much power by politicians. In the Second World War, Churchill, by then prime minister and defense secretary, argued that \u201cat the summit, true politics and strategy are one.\u201d Johnson did not take this approach, succumbing\u2014as his detractors would have it\u2014to fatalistic management rather than bold leadership, empowering the generals rather than taking responsibility himself. (Of course, Johnson\u2019s hospitalization in April also had an impact, something even his detractors, among them Tony Blair, told me cannot be discounted when trying to measure the government\u2019s performance.) Had Johnson not challenged his advisers because he was told what he wanted to hear\u2014that locking down the economy was not necessary? Was Johnson, part libertarian, part optimist, simply too instinctively skeptical of draconian limits on individual freedom to impose them? \u201cIt was a mixture of poor advice and fatalism on behalf of the experts,\u201d one former colleague of Johnson\u2019s told me, \u201cand complacency and boosterism on behalf of the PM.\u201d Read: The coronavirus is more than just a health crisis What it all adds up to, then, is a sobering reality: Institutional weaknesses of state capacity and advice were not corrected by political judgment, and political weaknesses were not corrected by institutional strength. The system was hardwired for a crisis that did not come, and could not adapt quickly enough to the one that did. O ver time, Britain\u2019s NHS has come to represent the country itself, its sense of identity and what it stands for. Set up in 1948, it became known as the first universal health-care system of any major country in the world (although in reality New Zealand got there first). Its creation, three years after victory in the Second World War, was a high-water mark in the country\u2019s power and prestige\u2014a time when it was a global leader, an exception. Of course, neither Britain nor its health-care system is exceptional anymore, at least in this regard. Every developed country in the world, apart from the United States, has a universal health-care system, many of which produce better results than the NHS. Yet from its beginnings, the NHS has occupied a unique hold on British life. It is routinely among the most trusted institutions in the country. Its key tenet\u2014that all Britons will have access to health care, free at the point of service\u2014symbolizes an aspirational egalitarianism that, even as inequality has risen since the Margaret Thatcher era, remains at the core of British identity. It is impossible to entirely disentangle modern Britain from the NHS, or vice versa. The country, so often lumped together with the U.S. as economically \u201cAnglo-Saxon,\u201d has a slice of socialism at the heart of its national life, largely left alone by governments of all persuasions. More recently, the NHS has been at the center of every election for at least a generation, a main character in the fight over Brexit, and finally, the linchpin in Britain\u2019s battle to contain the pandemic. In asking the country to rally to the NHS\u2019s defense, Johnson was triggering its sense of self, its sense of pride and national unity\u2014its sense of exceptionalism. Before the coronavirus, the NHS was already under considerable financial pressure. Waiting times for appointments were rising, and the country had one of the lowest levels of spare intensive-care capacity in Europe. In 2017, Simon Stevens, the NHS\u2019s chief executive, compared the situation to the time of the health service\u2019s founding decades prior: an \u201ceconomy in disarray, the end of empire, a nation negotiating its place in the world.\u201d Britain had come full circle, he seemed to be saying. A rebirth was needed. Instead, the country entered a rolling political crisis over Brexit, ending in Johnson\u2019s elevation to the premiership and election victory in December 2019. Then came the pandemic. When Italy\u2019s hospitals quickly became overwhelmed in early March, there were serious concerns that the NHS would meet a similar fate. Extraordinary measures would be required to make space for the coming crisis. The question now troubling experts is: at what cost? In early April, the first of England\u2019s seven new \u201cNightingale\u201d hospitals\u2014named after Florence Nightingale, the pioneering Victorian nurse\u2014was opened in a conference center in East London, ready for the expected surge in patients. The hospital was built in nine days with space for 4,000 beds and opened by Prince Charles to much acclaim, restoring the belief that the country could still act with speed. Medical students were pushed into service, retired NHS staff were called back in, and an army of volunteers was recruited to help hospitals function. Existing hospitals were hastily redesigned, nonessential operations were canceled, and the public was urged to avoid overburdening the system where possible. By early May, such was the success in creating additional capacity that the government announced that the Nightingale hospitals would be wound down and put in \u201chibernation\u201d after barely being used. Read: A Brit\u2019s advice for the U.S. health-care system Yet this apparent victory\u2014of sparing the NHS the fate that met Italy\u2019s hospitals\u2014may have been pyrrhic. According to Freedman\u2019s report, the effort to increase capacity potentially deterred people who needed urgent treatment but did not want to burden the health system. Others who required treatment might have been denied it because the focus had quickly shifted to COVID-19. The consequences may be serious and long term, but the most immediately tragic effect was that creating space in hospitals appears to have been prioritized over shielding Britain\u2019s elderly, many of whom were moved to care homes, part of what Britain calls the social-care sector, where the disease then spread. Some 25,000 patients were discharged into these care homes between March 17 and April 16, many without a requirement that they secure a negative coronavirus test beforehand. In effect, Britain was rigorously building capacity to help the NHS cope, but releasing potentially infected elderly, and vulnerable, patients in the process. By late June, more than 19,000 people had died in care homes from COVID-19. Separate excess-death data suggest that the figure may be considerably higher. According to a report by the International Long-Term Care Policy Network, a London-based research body, Britain has recorded more deaths from COVID-19 as a percentage of its nursing-home population than any other country in Europe, apart from Spain. A cross-party parliamentary report was more cutting : Sending patients into care homes without testing them for COVID-19 was an \u201cappalling error\u201d and an example of the government\u2019s \u201cslow, inconsistent and at times negligent\u201d approach to social care. This tragedy is an example of Britain\u2019s systemic failures of governance, according to leading health experts and former cabinet ministers I spoke with, an indictment of the country\u2019s short-term, centralized government apparatus. Britain failed to foresee the dangers of such an extraordinary rush to create hospital capacity, a shift that was necessary only because of years of underfunding and decades of missed opportunities to bridge the divide between the NHS and retirement homes, which other countries, such as Germany, had found the political will to do. Ultimately, the scandal is a consequence of a political culture that has proved unable to confront and address long-term problems, even when they are well known. The NHS remains the pride of the country, but it is kept separate from the largely private social-care sector. In 1948, this made sense, when child mortality and diseases such as tuberculosis were the chief health concerns, and life expectancy stood at 66 for men and 70 for women ( today it is 80 and 84, respectively). When the pandemic gripped Britain, these two systems came into conflict. The NHS was protected and given priority, leaving care homes in the lurch. Britain is far from unique in seeing the disease rip through its care homes. Yet this should not distract us from the reality that, just as other political leaders made better choices than Johnson did, other health systems, such as Germany\u2019s, which is better funded and decentralized, performed better than Britain\u2019s. Those I spoke with who either are in Germany or know about Germany\u2019s success told me there was an element of luck about the disparity with Britain. Germany had a greater industrial base to produce medical testing and personal protective equipment, and those who returned to Germany with the virus from abroad were often younger and healthier, meaning the initial strain on its health system was less. However, this overlooks core structural issues\u2014resulting from political choices in each country\u2014that meant that Germany proved more resilient when the crisis came, whether because of the funding formula for its health system, which allows individuals more latitude to top up their coverage with private contributions, or its decentralized nature, which meant that separate regions and hospitals were better able to respond to local outbreaks and build their own testing network. Also unlike Britain, which has ducked the problem of reforming elderly care, Germany created a system in 1995 that everyone pays into, avoids catastrophic costs, and has cross-party support. The reforms, although far from perfect, have provided the \u201cfoundations for a system that has been able to adapt and respond to changing circumstances,\u201d according to the British health think tank the Nuffield Trust\u2014exactly what has not happened in Britain. A second, related revelation of the crisis\u2014which also exposed the failure of the British state\u2014is that underneath the apparent simplicity of the NHS\u2019s single national model lies an engine of bewildering complexity, whose lines of responsibility, control, and accountability are unintelligible to voters and even to most politicians. In a number of conversations for this piece, the NHS\u2019s byzantine nature was likened to the spiderweb of regulatory bodies tasked with monitoring Britain\u2019s financial sector in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. That system was hailed as world leading but failed when called upon, and much of the regulatory burden has since been centralized. Britain, I was told, has found a way to be simultaneously overcentralized and weak at its center. The pandemic revealed the British state\u2019s inability to manage the nation\u2019s health: to create a funding model that does not solely promote efficiency, to rise above short-term problems and tackle the problem of old-age care, and to mend the broken system of accountability that runs through so much of British public life. Throughout the NHS\u2019s existence, British governments, both Conservative and Labour, have found the political will to tinker with it, but rarely to tackle its long-term challenges, fearful of losing votes. The NHS did not fail, but the system overall did\u2014and people died as a result. B ritain\u2019s unwillingness to address systemic problems is not confined to health care. Since at least the 1970s, growing inequality between comparatively rich southeast England (including London) and the rest of the country has spurred all parties to pledge to \u201crebalance the economy\u201d and make it less reliant on the capital. Yet large parts remain poorer than the European average. According to official EU figures , Britain has five regions with a per capita gross domestic product of less than $25,000. France, Germany, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden have none. If Britain were part of the United States, it would be anywhere from the third- to the eighth-poorest state, depending on the measure. Britain\u2019s performance in this crisis has been so bad, it is damaging the country\u2019s reputation, both at home and abroad. According to one senior British official, who has decades of experience and who does not serve Johnson, there was a sense of shock internationally that Britain had so obviously fallen short, a feeling echoed along the corridors of power in Westminster. Inside Downing Street, officials believe that the lessons of the pandemic apply far beyond the immediate confines of elderly care and coronavirus testing, taking in Britain\u2019s long-term economic failures and general governance, as well as what they regard as its ineffective foreign policy and diplomacy. Read: The coronavirus is never going away The reaction in Downing Street is a reminder that the Johnson program is revolutionary in instinct, aspiring to do far more than tinker, and Reaganite in its desire to overturn the status quo and usher in a new political zeitgeist that is more assertive on the world stage and more dynamic at home. Whether one believes the government or its self-perception does not change its intention to be transformative. One Johnson adviser told me the government would be remembered for \u201crestructuring the British state.\u201d Read: Boris Johnson can remake Britain like few before him The trouble for the prime minister is that although the pandemic might reinforce the belief that Britain\u2019s problems are deep and structural, his handling of it may serve to undermine the country\u2019s consent for him to pursue the kind of program he says is necessary. And the scale of the task itself is enormous. \u201cWe need a complete revamp of our government structure because it\u2019s not fit for purpose anymore,\u201d Boyd told me. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we really understand our weakness.\u201d In practice, does Johnson have the confidence to match his diagnosis of Britain\u2019s ills, given the timidity of his approach during the pandemic? The nagging worry among even Johnson\u2019s supporters in Parliament is that although he may campaign as a Ronald Reagan, he might govern as a Silvio Berlusconi, failing to solve the structural problems he has identified. As Blair and others pointed out to me, it is not just in the big calls that Johnson, his scientific advisers, and the system have been found wanting, but in day-to-day governance as well: the ability to get children back to school, open restaurants, protect the economy, and roll out a working contact-tracing system. The prime minister indicated the kind of big-thinking optimism that he believes is necessary with a recent speech detailing his plans to bring Britain out of its pandemic slump with a Rooseveltian New Deal. Yet what did it amount to? Little more than a mishmash of existing projects\u2014a speech and a plan that seemed to confirm Johnson\u2019s own critique about the country\u2019s systemic failure to think big and act boldly. Britain is, of course, not alone in being beset by structural problems, failures of governance, and periodic crises. France, Italy, Spain, and the EU as a whole have obvious and lasting dilemmas that have not been addressed. And the United States is divided by racism and inequity. Britain\u2019s international reputation may also dramatically shift if it discovers and shares a working vaccine while avoiding the worst of a second wave. This is not a story of pessimistic fatalism, of inevitable decline. Britain was able to partially reverse a previous slump in the 1980s, and Germany, seen as a European laggard in the \u201890s, is now the West\u2019s obvious success story. One of the strengths of the Westminster parliamentary system is that it occasionally produces governments\u2014like Johnson\u2019s\u2014with real power to effect change, should they try to enact it. But just because other countries screw things up does not mean Britain\u2019s problems aren\u2019t real and serious, and just because the country has recovered in the past does not mean it will again. It has been overtaken by many of its rivals, whether in terms of health provision or economic resilience, but does not seem to realize it. And once the pandemic passes, the problems Britain faces will remain: how to sustain institutions so that they bind the country together, not pull it apart; how to remain prosperous in the 21st century\u2019s globalized economy; how to promote its interests and values; how to pay for the ever-increasing costs of an aging population.

{"id":null,"body":"2019 was the hottest year on record, with one exception. The 2010s were the hottest decade ever measured on Earth, and 2019 was the second-hottest year ever measured, scientists at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced today. After a year of flash droughts , rampant  wildfires , and searing heat waves that set all-time records across Europe and turned parts of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet into slush, the finding was not a surprise to researchers, or likely anyone else. But it capped an anxious decade that saw human-caused climate change transform from a far-off threat into an everyday fact of life. Last year was 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014or just under 1 degree Celsius\u2014warmer than the 20th-century average, Gavin Schmidt, the chief climate scientist at NASA, said at a briefing announcing the news. Almost everywhere on the planet\u2019s surface was warmer than average, though the Arctic was especially searing. \u201cEvery decade since the 1960s has been warmer than the decade previous,\u201d he said. In short, it\u2019s bad, but you probably knew that already. At least four different groups of scientists, each working independently, have now concluded that the 2010s were the hottest decade of the modern era. (NASA and NOAA start this era at 1880, when they say weather record-keeping became reliable and widespread enough to trust, but the nonprofit research agency Berkeley Earth argues that 2019 was the second-warmest year since at least 1850.) What\u2019s worse is that greenhouse-gas pollution from fossil fuels, which are the biggest driver of climate change, also surged to an all-time high last year, according to a preliminary estimate. Deke Arndt, a chief climate scientist at NOAA, said at the briefing that \u201can obvious signal\u201d of this greenhouse-gas-powered heating had appeared in the upper layers of the ocean, which broke the all-time heat record last year . Let\u2019s be honest: \u201cLast year was one of the hottest years ever recorded\u201d has become a common story. It\u2019s news in the same way the most popular boys\u2019 baby names are news. ( Wow, dear, did you see James won again? ) The climate scientist Joseph Majkut quipped that the tone of this year\u2019s announcement was less \u201cSee, see we told you\u201d and more \u201cWell, duh.\u201d Read: Australia will lose to climate change Schmidt, the NASA scientist, nodded at this during the briefing. \u201cThe fact is, the planet is warming, and every year we add one extra data point to this graph, which may not seem like a terribly important thing, but people seem interested,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing here is not the ranking \u2026 but the consistency of the long-term trend we\u2019re seeing.\u201d Virtually every important climate record has been broken and re-broken over the past few years: The past five years are the five warmest years on record, the past six the warmest six, the past nine the warmest nine. Since Donald Trump rode down his gilded escalator and announced he was running for president, the world has experienced its hottest recorded version of each individual month , according to NOAA. So it\u2019s worth going back in history to see just how outlandish our current situation is. The median American is a little more than 38 years old. The year before she was born was 1980. It was, at the time, the hottest year ever measured. A July heat wave that year killed 1,265 Americans and caused more than $20 billion in damage nationwide. The larger significance of this milestone was not well understood at the time. In an op-ed that summer , a weatherman in Westchester, New York, expressed so much regret about giving in and buying a car with an air conditioner that he wondered whether Americans of his demographic were \u201cless tolerant of extreme heat than our parents and grandparents.\u201d His parents\u2019 generation made do without air-conditioned cars, he figured, and his grandparents didn\u2019t even have electric ceiling fans. Were they a tougher breed? They were not, he learned: The weather had gotten warmer. He was shocked. \u201cIt came as a great surprise to discover that during the first three decades of this century there were fewer heat waves (27) than during the last three (49),\u201d he wrote in The New York Times . \u201cMy hat is off to the present generation \u2026 If we create our own cooler environment with air conditioners, well then, we deserve it.\u201d His editorial did not mention global warming or \u201cthe greenhouse effect,\u201d as it was then called. And the hottest-year record probably did seem like a fluke: 1980 was the first time the record had been broken in 35 years. In 1981, the median American was born, a happy and healthy statistical girl. The planet inched even hotter, setting a new all-time record a few hundredths of a degree Celsius warmer than 1980\u2019s. Then, in 1983, as she learned to string sentences together, the record was smashed again. The global hottest-year record had now been broken three times in four years. Read: The concession to climate change I will not make A few years passed, all of them warmer than average but not record-breakingly so. She started school. As our median American entered first grade, in 1987, the world again experienced its hottest year ever. Now the planet\u2019s new all-time heat record was a tenth of a degree Celsius warmer than it had been in 1980. Then 1988 began. Its first five months were hotter than any comparable period\u2014hotter than all those record-breaking years that had just happened. \u201cIt is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here,\u201d James Hansen, a lead NASA climate scientist, told Congress in June. His declaration was front-page news. George H. W. Bush, campaigning for president, promised to do something about it: \u201cThose who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the \u2018White House\u2019 effect,\u201d he declared on the trail . By the end of the year, our median American was in second grade, Bush was president, and Hansen\u2019s prediction had borne out: 1988 was even hotter than 1987. It was the new hottest year on record. She kept growing up; 1989, third grade, was among the five warmest years ever measured. The Berlin Wall fell. The years 1990 and 1991 were even hotter: the two new warmest years ever measured, each toastier than 1988, 1987, or any other year in the observed NOAA record. In June 1991, as the American wrapped up fifth grade, a massive volcano named Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines. Its ash blocked sunlight and cooled global temperatures in 1992, the same year Bill Clinton was elected. Clinton\u2019s vice president, Albert Gore, had warned a few years earlier of an \u201cecological Kristallnacht\u201d aggravated by heat-trapping greenhouse-gas pollution in the atmosphere. Yet Clinton and Gore failed to pass an early version of a climate policy, a \u201cBTU tax\u201d on energy use, in 1993, the following year. It was a funny time: 1993, even though it was cooled by Mount Pinatubo\u2019s ash, was still as hot as 1980\u2014 which had once been the hottest year ever measured . Then 1994 arrived. It was even hotter than \u201993. The median American started high school in 1995, and temperatures began to surge to new highs. That year was the new hottest year ever. A five-day heat wave killed more than 700 people in Chicago alone, one of the deadliest American natural disasters of all time. The next year, 1996, though not as bad, was still among the 10 hottest years ever. 1997 pushed through 1995\u2019s record and became the new all-time-hottest year measured. Then a monstrous El Ni\u00f1o lifted 1998 even higher\u2014the hottest year of the 20th century, it was more than twice as far from the century\u2019s average as 1980. And as the median American graduated from high school in 1999, about 16 percent of the world\u2019s coral reefs were dying or dead . The new century arrived. The years of her early twenties\u20142001, 2002, and 2003\u2014were each hotter than any year in the 20th century except 1998. In 2003, then the second-hottest year ever, a continent-sized heat wave killed as many as 70,000 people in Europe. Two years later, 2005 set a new hottest-year-ever record. The years 2006, 2007, and 2009 were all among the five warmest on record. Then 2010 broke the all-time heat record again. That same year, the Obama administration failed to pass a massive climate bill through the Senate. She turned 30 in 2011, which was both a chill year for this century\u2014and warmer than any year before 1997. The years 2012 and 2013 were among the five hottest ever. Then came the three-peat: 2014 broke 2010\u2019s all-time record, then 2015 was even hotter, then 2016 was hotter still. On land, 2016 was nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 20th-century baseline. It was three times as hot over the baseline as 1981, the year she was born.","headline":"This Is Your Life on Climate Change","article_name":604939.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-record-nasa-and-noaa-say\/604939\/","date_published":"2020-01-15 19:13:21","article_length":8738,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:18.591152","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-record-nasa-and-noaa-say\/604939\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The state\u2019s heat waves, blackouts, and fires\u2014amid a pandemic\u2014offer a warning of our fossil-fuel future. When I moved to California five years ago, I planted a tree in my yard. It was a Red Baron peach, chosen for its showy, bright-pink blossoms and its ability to grow fruit with few cool nights. For the past nine centuries, Southern California has been perfect for this tree, with mild winters and mild summers. I planted the Red Baron for the climate we once had. That climate is no more. My neighborhood has already warmed by more than 2 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial period\u2014twice the global average. In my short time as a Californian, I\u2019ve seen a years-long drought. I\u2019ve evacuated my home as a wildfire closed in. I\u2019ve lived through unprecedented heat waves. Annie Lowrey: California is becoming unlivable Trees, like all living beings, need time and stability to grow. But these essentials are no longer available. And it\u2019s not just my backyard trees that are threatened under a changing climate. Many people have been grieving from the news that we may have lost some of the most majestic coastal redwoods to these latest fires. These giants have stood for more than a thousand years . For my generation, and the ones coming up behind us, the simple act of planting trees now requires a leap of faith. I worry about how long they will last before they are taken by drought or fire. And if we can\u2019t plan for our trees\u2019 future, how are we supposed to plan for our children\u2019s? Right now my friends across the state are staring down disaster after disaster, suffering through climate change in action while they struggle with the ongoing pandemic. Last week, a heat wave baked the West. In Death Valley, a world record may have been set for the hottest temperature observed on Earth: 130 degrees Fahrenheit. From Phoenix, Arizona, to the Bay Area, people turned up their air-conditioning, straining California\u2019s electricity infrastructure, because the state imports power from its neighbors. Demand outstripped supply, and the grid operator started rolling blackouts. The cause is climate change: It has made heat waves five times more likely to occur in the western United States. During the blackouts, California had unusually intense lightning strikes, which dotted the darkened landscape with electricity from the sky. These storms triggered fires across Northern California, forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes. Climate change has increased fire risk , and lengthened the fire season . It\u2019s only August, and already more land has burned in California this year than all of 2019. These climate disasters are happening against the backdrop of the still uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak, which makes it harder for people to flee to safety. Evacuating to a friend\u2019s house or a community center when a highly contagious illness is circulating is not a simple choice. Read: Two disasters are exponentially worse than one Those theoretically \u201csafe\u201d in their homes don\u2019t have it easy, either. Without electricity, many Californians have to choose between opening the windows and breathing in air choked with smoke, or keeping them closed in a hot house. My friend posted a picture of herself wearing an N95 mask with an exhalation valve, and a surgical mask on top: the first to protect herself against the smoke, the second to protect others from the virus. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where we have to decide which mask to wear for which disaster, but this is the world we are making. And we\u2019ve only started to alter the climate. Imagine what it will be like when we\u2019ve doubled or tripled the warming, as we are on track to do. Climate change is not just destabilizing California\u2019s grid. The East Coast is facing down a deadly hurricane season and has already seen outages for 1.4 million people . An unprecedented wind storm\u2014which some are calling an \u201cinland hurricane\u201d\u2014left a quarter million people in the Midwest without power. Yet some people refuse to acknowledge that climate change is the cause of the problems California is facing. The Wall Street Journal published a misleading editorial blaming the state\u2019s reliance on renewable energy for the outages. In reality, several fossil-gas plants unexpectedly went offline when the heat wave struck, resulting in less available power. Gas plants can struggle to operate in the heat. In an ironic twist, burning fossil fuels will become less reliable in our hotter world. And California\u2019s grid is connected to other states\u2019, so when a heat wave spikes electricity demand from Arizona to Nevada, that leaves less power to import. With lower rainfall and many years of drought\u2014again, caused in part by climate change\u2014many of the state\u2019s hydropower plants were also underperforming. Read: This is what adapting to climate change looks like Simple human error also contributed to the blackouts. The agency in charge of operating the grid was confused about which plants were available to make electricity. One renewable-energy plant\u2014a geothermal power station\u2014was actually providing more power than the grid operator expected. The CEO of California\u2019s grid operator put it simply : Renewables \u201c are not a factor \u201d in the blackouts. My electric utility echoed this view in an email that urged people with solar power at home to help out. Despite electric utilities attacking rooftop-solar  policy for the past decade, homes that produce extra power deliver excess energy to the grid, helping neighbors in need. More clean energy is a good thing. California must continue on the path it has been on for years: leading the world in building the clean economy. In 1978, the state set its first goal for clean energy, aiming for 1 percent of power from wind energy. Forty years later, we now have a goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2045 in state law. If anything, California must move faster . And we must get states from the Midwest to the South to do the same. The Biden campaign\u2019s pledge to reach 100 percent clean power by 2035 exemplifies the kind of leadership we need in this time of crisis. Cleaning up our electricity system will allow us to eliminate about 80 percent of our carbon emissions, because we can use this clean power to fuel our cars, our homes, and some of our industries. Doing this will be a lot of work\u2014so it will create millions  of good-paying jobs that can\u2019t be taken overseas. We have seen what using fossil fuels has done to California. They have poisoned communities. Dirtied our air. And led to record fires, heat waves, and drought. We are not going back. I still believe we can tackle the climate crisis. I\u2019m still planting fruit trees in my backyard. At last count, I have 34\u2014one for each year I\u2019ve circled the sun. I don\u2019t know how long they will stand, but I will keep doing everything I can to ensure their future. What\u2019s happening in California has a name: climate change. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. A better world is possible. For all of us, for all of our children, and even for our trees.","headline":"How Can We Plan for the Future in California?","article_name":615610.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/californias-disasters-are-a-warning-climate-change-is-here\/615610\/","date_published":"2020-08-23 11:30:00","article_length":7021,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:19.191346","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/californias-disasters-are-a-warning-climate-change-is-here\/615610\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"They\u2019re a single-use, disposable consumer item\u2014a greener option, but not a green one. The bright, cold, bitter tang. The soft notes of walnut and dirt. The anticipation of the jolt of electricity. The feeling of wet cardboard in my mouth. Nowadays this is what I get when I grab my morning iced coffee in San Francisco, one of several municipalities that have banned plastic straws in recent months. The paper ones are a necessary corrective, the argument goes. They work just fine, while their plastic cousins choke the oceans and extend our dependence on fossil-fuel products. But as a corrective, they leave much to be desired: Paper straws are a crummy solution to a problem that need not exist in the first place. Plastic straws might be everything terrible about American consumerism, individually wrapped. But paper straws put the lie to the belief that we can consume our way out of the problems created by consumerism. In the case of plastic straws, those problems include overflowing landfills, dead marine life, and a garbage-clogged ocean. Plastic straws are\u2014for most Americans, though certainly not all \u2014a luxury, not a need. Still, we use an astronomical number of them a year. Their life span is short: Get extracted from a paper sheath, swim around in Diet Pepsi for three minutes, die. And their afterlife is long. Plastic gets entombed in landfills. In the oceans, it suffocates and strangles birds and fish and orcas and turtles, and breaks down into microplastics, pervading the food chain. An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the world\u2019s waterways each and every year. In our lifetimes, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea. Read: Disposable America Replace plastic straws with paper straws, solve some proportion of the problem, right? Yes, if only a tiny share. Straws make up just 0.025 percent of the plastic that finds its way into the ocean each year; the United States, the biggest per capita producer of garbage on Earth , is not even close to the biggest producer of mismanaged plastic waste . On the one hand, straw bans will lead to thousands and thousands of fewer straws in the ocean; on the other hand, straw bans will not change the underlying environmental calculus at all. Plus, paper straws are still a single-use, disposable consumer item\u2014a greener option, but not a green one. Making a paper straw requires growing a tree, cutting it down, and pulping and pressing it into a tube. Manufacturers then use fossil fuels to ship the straws to stores and caf\u00e9s. Many paper straws on the market are not even compostable or recyclable, as promised. Metal straws might be better for the environment, if they are used often enough. But restaurants report high rates of theft\u2014meaning they need to restock metal straws regularly. And making them requires environmentally destructive mining and considerable amounts of energy. It just isn\u2019t easy being green, at least not if you are trying to be green by buying stuff. Products marketed as being earth-friendly are often not that earth-friendly. The compostable fiber bowls you get at places such as Chipotle and Sweetgreen leach toxic \u201cforever\u201d chemicals into the ground and groundwater. Using those shared, dockless scooters produces more emissions than traveling by bus, electric bicycle, regular old bicycle, or moped, or on foot. Reusable grocery bags need to be employed dozens or even thousands of times before they are truly a greener alternative to flimsy plastic. Replacing certain forms of consumption with other, marginally better forms of consumption is not going to save the planet. Annie Lowrey: Conservatives are wrong about immigration Arguably, it might prompt consumers to think about their consumption, with paper straws and reusable grocery bags and shared urban bicycles acting as a gateway to more meaningful changes. Social norms matter a lot when it comes to the environment , and social contagion is real. Maybe paper straws will persuade people to do the big stuff: stop flying, quit eating cows, give up their cars, have one fewer kid, vote into office politicians who could use the levers of government to do something meaningful, such as impose a tax on carbon. Or maybe using a paper straw will lull consumers into a false sense that what they are doing matters, and is enough. This is a real problem: Studies have shown that using a green alternative provides people with \u201cmoral license\u201d to continue to behave badly, or even to behave worse. Bringing your own shopping bag to the store increases your consumption of \u201chedonic\u201d items. Buying green products makes you more likely to cheat and steal . There are better, bigger policy proposals out there, and we desperately need them put into practice: bans on fishing , hefty taxes on plastic. The U.S. government needs to participate in the project of saving the planet; the most meaningful change any consumer can make is through voting. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be here, drinking my iced coffee straight from the cup.","headline":"The Case Against Paper Straws","article_name":596302.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/08\/paper-straws-wont-stop-climate-change\/596302\/","date_published":"2019-08-20 10:00:00","article_length":5002,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:19.421107","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/08\/paper-straws-wont-stop-climate-change\/596302\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court affirms climate change\u2014but that\u2019s not necessarily good news for the EPA. It probably isn\u2019t surprising that Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2014a longtime member of the conservative movement whom President Trump nominated to the Supreme Court on Monday\u2014has written about climate change. What might be surprising is that he says it\u2019s real. \u201cThe earth is warming. Humans are contributing,\u201d he told a federal courtroom two years ago, during a hearing about a major Barack Obama climate policy . \u201cThere is a moral imperative. There is a huge policy imperative. The pope\u2019s involved.\u201d He\u2019s even inscribed this view in his judicial opinions. \u201cThe task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important at the national and international level,\u201d he wrote in 2013 . Yet this is not necessarily good news for liberals. Kavanaugh has sometimes sympathized with the need for environmental protection. But because he considers global warming to be charged with a \u201chuge policy imperative,\u201d he\u2019s skeptical that the Environment Protection Agency (or the executive branch) should be fighting it alone. And as a future justice, he\u2019s likely to block the agency from doing so. It is a portentous moment for U.S. environmental law. President Obama spent much of his last term trying to deploy the EPA\u2014and one of its animating laws, the Clean Air Act\u2014against the threat of climate change. The Trump administration has devoted its energy to undoing this work, and environmental groups are trying to block him. These two approaches were already likely to produce a clash at the Supreme Court in the next few years. But last month, the court\u2019s great swing vote on environmental issues\u2014Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2014announced his resignation. Kennedy famously determined the direction of the nine-member court\u2014joining its four liberals on some cases, its four conservatives on others\u2014but he shaped few parts of American law as completely as he shaped the environment. Since joining the court in 1988, Kennedy voted in the majority in every environmental case in front of the court except one , according to Richard Lazarus , a Harvard Law professor who has argued more than a dozen cases in front of the justices. His resignation throws the court\u2019s right-leaning consensus into disarray. With Kennedy gone, conservative groups will likely sue the federal government, trying to exact new law from an emboldened conservative majority. Before the next presidential election, the Supreme Court could rule on the EPA\u2019s authority to fight climate change, the geographical scope of the Clean Water Act, and even the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act. On these issues, Chief Justice John Roberts will function as the Court\u2019s ideological center. Roberts has occasionally acted as a swing vote on some high-profile cases. It seemed likely that Donald Trump would nominate another judge like Neil Gorsuch, a Federalist Society\u2013minted conservative who was skeptical of regulatory agencies but who had rarely written about them. Instead, he picked Brett Kavanaugh. Since 2006, Kavanaugh has served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appellate court that hears most EPA cases. During this time, Kavanaugh has been randomly assigned to hear dozens of EPA cases, meaning he has described his thinking about the environment across hundreds of pages of opinions. \u201cWe probably have more of a record for Kavanaugh for environmental law than we do for anyone else in recent memory,\u201d Lazarus told me. \u201cRoberts came from the D.C. Circuit, Scalia came from the D.C. Circuit, Ginsburg did, Thomas did\u2014but none of them had the same number of EPA cases that Kavanaugh\u2019s had.\u201d He has not been a friend of the agency, though he often appears sympathetic to it. Kavanaugh has emerged as a courteous jurist who is intensely skeptical of whether the EPA can legally regulate new environmental threats, experts told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a kinder, gentler version of Antonin Scalia. I think his judicial philosophy is almost identical, but he\u2019s more polite, and more able to make nice noises about the underlying policies,\u201d said Ann Carlson , a professor of environmental law at UCLA. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough grader when it comes to a regulatory agency,\u201d said Jonathan Adler , a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose scholarship led to a major challenge to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHe\u2019s not looking for reasons to strike things down, and he\u2019s not looking for broad constitutional arguments to constrain agencies. But he clearly believes agencies have to dot their i \u2019s and cross their t \u2019s.\u201d Kavanaugh is particularly skeptical of new EPA programs. Like Scalia, he argues that the agency should only issue a new rule if Congress granted them explicit, precise rules to do so in a piece of legislation, like the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act. During the Obama administration, Kavanaugh heard three major cases about the EPA\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act. In every case, he opposed the agency\u2019s position. \u201cWhy did he rule against the EPA in all three cases?\u201d Lazarus asked. \u201cHe\u2019s not like a Scalia\u2014or, to some extent, an Alito\u2014where you read their opinions and find there\u2019s an antipathy, a hostility, to environmental law. Scalia is sometimes even sarcastic in his tone.\u201d \u201cYou never see this in Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe is a really decent person, with enormous integrity, and there\u2019s just not that kind of bent with him. But he is a conservative judge and a stickler for the notion of separation of powers. If he\u2019s going to find an agency has sweeping regulatory authority, with significant economic or social implications, he\u2019s going to want to find that Congress really intended it. He\u2019s going to want to see specific language in the statute that says Congress really meant to give that authority away.\u201d \u201cThat is, in the abstract, a perfectly fair and neutral principle. But it does tend, in environmental law, to lead to one answer, which is: No .\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily because Kavanaugh loathes the cause of environmental protection, Lazarus told me. Instead, it\u2019s because Congress hasn\u2019t passed a major environmental law since it revamped the Clean Air Act in 1990. \u201cWhen the EPA is trying to come up with a way of addressing a problem with some really creative and pragmatic solution, it has to use legal language that is 28 years old, in some cases almost 40 years old,\u201d he said. One of these three Clean Air Act cases provides a good example. It concerned the EPA\u2019s ability to regulate \u201ccross-state air pollution,\u201d that is, pollution from coal-fired power plants in one state that blows downwind into another. Kavanaugh found that the agency couldn\u2019t regulate that activity under the Clean Air Act. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court\u2014and the justices disagreed. Both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy joined the liberals in favor of the EPA , affirming the rule. \u201cThey were more willing to read into that [Clean Air Act] language some pragmatic authority for the EPA\u201d than Kavanaugh was, said Lazarus. In the two other major Clean Air Act cases, the Supreme Court eventually took the same side as Kavanaugh. \u201cHe somewhat already appears to be listened to [by the justices] on these issues,\u201d Adler said. Outside of those major cases, Kavanaugh has often but not always ruled against the agency. In 2013, he voted with the EPA , ruling that the agency was legally permitted to revoke a permit for mountaintop-removal mining. A year later, when a different legal question was argued in the same case, he voted against the agency . If there is one bright spot for liberals, it\u2019s that Kavanaugh may be just as skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s recent attempts at deregulation. \u201cIf he faces some Scott Pruitt\u2013era rule that was kind of done quick and dirty, I don\u2019t think the administration should expect him to rubber-stamp it,\u201d Adler said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t grade federal agencies on a curve.\u201d \u201cIf you look at his jurisprudence on the D.C. Circuit, I think he will be a stickler on procedural compliance,\u201d agreed Lazarus. One of those \u201cbig problems\u201d where he may be more skeptical is climate change. In a September 2016 hearing , Kavanaugh seemed skeptical of the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, an EPA rule that aimed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector. It seemed clear that he considered that rule to go beyond the scope of the agency\u2019s authority. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear he\u2019s going to be significantly more conservative than Justice Kennedy, and his nomination does not bode well for climate-change regulation under the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cWhen Gorsuch was nominated, there wasn\u2019t very much in his record. With Kavanaugh, the record\u2019s really clear.\u201d \u201cI think he would have decided against Massachusetts v. EPA, \u201d she said, referring to the landmark 2007 Supreme Court case that found the EPA could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. \u201cEverything points to the direction of a very narrow construction of the Clean Air Act, and that will seriously limit the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases in a way that makes a meaningful difference.\u201d A recent report found that Trump administration EPA rollbacks would cause the United States to miss its goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change, emitting hundreds of thousands more tons of carbon dioxide by 2025 than it once pledged. Carlson also wondered if Kavanaugh\u2019s stated belief in climate change carried an ulterior motive. According to a 1984 Supreme Court ruling , the judiciary branch must show some amount of deference to decisions made by agencies like the EPA. But the courts are allowed to discard that deference if the decision concerns a \u201cmajor question\u201d of political significance. \u201cI think he\u2019s supporting his own judicial philosophy by saying that climate change is real and a big problem,\u201d Carlson told me. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, It\u2019s a major question. Congress you should step up and act. This is not the place for EPA to be engaged in major policymaking.\u201d Adler, the conservative law professor, agreed that Kavanaugh might strike down future climate rules from the EPA.\u201cI get that the environmental community looks at him and says, He\u2019s going to get in the way of aggressive climate regulation unless Congress does something . And he might.\u201d \u201cBut if climate change is a problem, and it is; and if we should be doing something about it, which we should; then barring some massive technological breakthrough, unless and until Congress steps up to the plate, we\u2019re kind of screwed,\u201d he said.","headline":"Brett Kavanaugh: \u2018The Earth Is Warming\u2019","article_name":564830.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/07\/what-would-kavanaugh-mean-for-the-environment\/564830\/","date_published":"2018-07-11 11:00:00","article_length":10537,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:19.963399","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/07\/what-would-kavanaugh-mean-for-the-environment\/564830\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The pontiff plans to issue a rare and controversial plea for Catholics to consider the environment. Recent polls show his message just might resonate. Pope Francis has ambitious environmental plans for 2015. Come March, he will deliver a 50 to 60-page edict urging his 1.2 billion Catholic followers to take action against climate change. The Pontiff will make his announcement during his visit to the Philippine city of Tacloban, which was ravaged by typhoon Haiyan, which killed thousands in 2013. But within his global congregation, many conservative Catholics are expected to oppose the pope\u2019s environmental views. The message comes months in advance of the next United Nations climate meeting, which is slated to begin November 2015 in Paris. The pope\u2019s lead scientific adviser Bishop Marcelo Sorondo, said that the pope\u2019s message to his bishops, called an encyclical, is supposed to influence world leaders as they make their final recommendations after 20 years of negotiating how to reduce global carbon emissions, The Guardian reported. \u201cThe idea is to convene a meeting with leaders of the main religions to make all people aware of the state of our climate,\u201d Sorondo said to Cafod, the Catholic development agency, of the pope\u2019s plans. Francis has previously pointed to the environment as being \u201cone of the greatest challenges of our time,\u201d and he says that Catholics have a moral and scientific obligation to protect it. But the move to publish an encyclical goes beyond offering a soundbite. \u201cA papal encyclical is rare. It is among the highest levels of a pope\u2019s authority,\u201d Dan Misleh, director of the Catholic climate covenant, said to The Guardian . The pope will distribute the lengthy document to 5,000 Catholic bishops and 400,000 priests, who will then share the message with their congregations in churches across the world. In the United States, where climate change is a controversial topic, the majority of Catholics agree that the Earth is getting warmer, about a third of that group did not believe that the change is due to human activity, according to a 2012 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute . The same poll found that about 82 percent of Republicans doubt that humans cause climate change. Among the climate deniers include some influential Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner. Pope Francis also faces fierce opposition from U.S. evangelicals . According to the \u00a0Public Religion Research Institute, 69 percent of evangelicals do not believe in anthropogenic climate change, and many vehemently oppose its existence. Calvin Beisner, the spokesman for the conservative Cornwall Alliance , believes that the idea of human-caused climate change is \u201cun-biblical.\u201d \u201cThe pope should back off,\u201d he said to The Guardian . \u201cThe Catholic church is correct on the ethical principles but has been misled on the science.\u201d Globally only 11 percent of people see the pope unfavorably, and 60 percent approve of him, according to a 2014 poll by the Pew Research Center . Pope Francis is overwhelmingly accepted by heavily Catholic countries: 84 in percent Europe; 78 percent in the U.S., and 72 percent in Latin America. Now, with the pope\u2019s environmental encyclical forthcoming, and his global support at astronomical levels, it\u2019s still uncertain how much influence his environmental push will have with the most devout deniers of climate change.","headline":"What Can a Popular Pope Do About Climate Change?

{"id":null,"body":"Rep. Chris Gibson of New York is leading the charge, and nine other Republicans are on board. A coalition of House Republicans is gearing up to make waves by calling for action to fight climate change on the eve of Pope Francis\u2019s visit to Capitol Hill. Ten Republicans have so far signed onto a resolution affirming that human activity contributes to climate change and endorsing action to respond to the threat of Earth\u2019s changing climate. The resolution is expected to be unveiled as early as Thursday. Rep. Chris Gibson, a New York Republican, led the charge in crafting the resolution and convincing other Republicans to speak out in support. \u201cThis is a call for action to study how humans are impacting our environment and to look for consensus on areas where we can take action to mitigate the risks and balance our impacts,\u201d Gibson told National Journal . Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Robert Dold of Illinois, Dave Reichert of Washington, Pat Meehan, Ryan Costello, and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Richard Hanna and Elise Stefanik of New York all confirmed to National Journal that they have signed on as cosponsors of the resolution. The timing is no accident. Pope Francis has warned that man-made climate change will hurt the poor and most vulnerable members of society, and the Vatican is\u00a0 calling on world governments to work together to fight global warming in June. When Francis speaks to Congress next week\u2014an event that will mark the first time any pope has addressed a joint session of the House and Senate\u2014he is widely expected to call for bold and decisive efforts to combat Earth\u2019s rapidly-rising temperatures. ClimateWire  first reported Gibson\u2019s plan to introduce the resolution this week. Environmentalists are preparing to seize on the occasion of the papal visit, and the enthusiasm for climate action it is expected to gin up, by organizing a major climate rally on the National Mall the day of the speech on Sept. 24. But a call for action on global warming led by Republicans is something altogether different. Ever since the collapse of comprehensive climate legislation, which died in the Senate during President Obama\u2019s first term, Republicans have largely shunned legislative efforts to confront global warming. Even admitting that human activity has caused temperatures to rise has become virtually off-limits among Republicans. On the 2016 campaign trail, some Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas still deny the reality of global warming, while others such as former Sen. Rick Santorum have said that there is nothing the United States can do to make a dent in the situation. Republican presidential contenders are unanimous in voicing opposition to President Obama\u2019s regulations to rein in carbon emissions from power plants, a major policy initiative that the White House has taken to combat the threat of global warming. At least some moderate Republicans have grown frustrated by what they see as their party\u2019s silence on a pressing and urgent problem. The Environmental Defense Action Fund, the political arm for the moderate environmental organization Environmental Defense Fund, bankrolled a major ad buy last year in a bid to bolster green-minded Republicans, an attempt to turn the tide in the face of conservative inaction when it comes to climate change. Virtually all of the House Republicans who have signed on to the soon-to-be introduced climate resolution hail from moderate or swing districts, many in the Northeastern U.S. A number of the cosponsors are up for reelection in 2016 in moderate districts where backing a resolution in favor of climate change could help them in the race. Curbelo and Dold are both running for reelection. Reichert, Meehan, Costello, Hanna, Ros-Lehtinen, and Stefanik have not yet announced if they plan to run for reelection. Gibson, the lead author of the resolution, and Rep. Fitzpatrick are not running for reelection. Forty-eight per\u00adcent of Republican voters prefer a can\u00addid\u00adate call\u00ading for ac\u00adtion to tackle hu\u00adman-made glob\u00adal warm\u00ading, as op\u00adposed to someone who sidesteps the is\u00adsue en\u00adtirely or calls cli\u00admate change a hoax, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a sur\u00advey re\u00adleased in January by The New York Times , Stan\u00adford Uni\u00adversity, and environmental think tank Re\u00adsources for the Fu\u00adture. Still, the resolution is all but guaranteed to spark criticism from environmentalists, who are likely to say that that the call to action is watered down. While the resolution notes that human activity contributes to a changing climate , it stops short of explicitly acknowledging the scientific consensus that human activity has been the primary driver of global warming in recent years. Many environmentalists believe that meaningful action to tackle rising temperatures will come only on the heels of an affirmation of that scientific consensus, warning that if lawmakers do not embrace the consensus as fact, it will be far too easy to find excuses not to act. For now, the fate of the Republican climate push remains unclear. House Speaker John Boehner has dismissed the threat of man-made climate change in the past, saying that he is not qualified to debate climate science.","headline":"House Republicans Plan to Call for Action on Climate Change","article_name":444888.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/09\/house-republicans-plan-to-call-for-action-on-climate-change\/444888\/","date_published":"2015-09-15 09:00:00","article_length":5195,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:20.501107","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/09\/house-republicans-plan-to-call-for-action-on-climate-change\/444888\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Was Oklahoma's massive storm an inevitable side effect of higher atmospheric temperatures, or was it simply a bad storm, like so many before? Here's a survey of opinions so far. Unlike climate change itself, there is legitimate debate on the role warmer temperatures may have played in events like Monday's tornado in Moore, Oklahoma . Was the massive storm an inevitable side effect of higher atmospheric temperatures, or was it simply a bad storm, like so many before? What follows is a quick survey of opinions from around the web, from sources of varying respectability. We assigned the rhetorical strength of each claim judged on a scale from 0 to 400 parts-per-million of atmospheric CO 2 . Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island: Blame climate change On the Senate floor Monday, Whitehouse used the storms as part of a litany of disasters for which America on the whole needs to pay. As transcribed by the Daily Caller : Believability: 80 ppm. Whitehouse doesn't appear to have made a strong case for the link, no matter how you feel about his argument for economic foresight. Bill Nye the Science Guy: Blame climate change Nye, known more for his advocacy these days than for the TV show that produced his name, took to Twitter to promote his appearance on CNN. In that tweet, he made the case. Back to CNN midnight @ piersmorganlive . Tornado 2 miles wide. More energy in the atmosphere- means more trouble. Believability: 300 ppm. Format of the message notwithstanding, Nye makes a key point for those who think there might be a link. The entire point of atmospheric warming is that the temperature in the atmosphere increases. And increased temperatures, you may remember from science class, means more energy, the little atoms of nitrogen and oxygen and carbon dioxide whipping around faster and faster. That energy can manifest in on-the-ground weather \u2014\u00a0though whether or not that includes tornados isn't clear. Head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Don't blame climate change At least, not yet. Emphasizing the need for more data, Rajendra Pachauri expressed skepticism to reporters Tuesday . Believability: 300 ppm. Pachauri appears, in part, to be exercising a classic hedge against linking weather events to climate change: it's nearly always impossible to say this event couldn't have happened without increased warming. Remember the classic example of the dog going for a walk . Climate change is manifested through long-term trends more than individual events. And as The Atlantic 's Alexis Madrigal noted Monday , so far there's no trend toward more or more powerful tornadoes. Climate scientists: Maybe The Huffington Post spoke with scientists from Princeton University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Brooks also made another point: When it's too warm now, there aren't more tornadoes. During last year's heat wave, there were fewer than normal. Believability: 380 ppm. This is precisely the sort of measured response one would expect from scientists. And as the people who study this stuff, they deserve a little more deference. The Guardian 's Harry Enten: Maybe Enten, a reporter and statistics expert,\u00a0 notes that there wasn't much unusual about Monday's weather conditions. Making the question: will we see more such \"looks\" in the future? Maybe. \"[W]e'll never know whether larger global warming factors were at play in Monday's storms.\" Believability: 120 ppm. Enten's analysis syncs with the science, but it's hard to assign too much weight to analysis alone. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth: Blame climate change (in part) Scientific American interviewed Trenberth, who works for the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Trenberth notes that a little more warming can have a big effect on weather systems. But, he warns, \"climate change does not change the weather or patterns of weather (much).\" In other words, you might be able to blame the storm's strength on climate change, but not the storm itself. Believability: 350 ppm. The government pays this guy to know about the climate, so we'll defer to his expertise. American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd: Don't blame climate change Time 's Bryan Walsh points to this tweet, from an exchange he had with Shepherd. @ detroitmark @ bryanrwalsh climate change is real issue but can we not dilute the issue with that right now. No links to tornadoes Believability: 330 ppm. \u00a0Shepherd, who is also a scientist with NASA and climate science professor, is definitely in a position to have an informed opinion. Houston Chronicle 's SciGuy: Why not both? As the SciGuy (Eric Berger) notes, we were recently talking about how few tornadoes we'd seen. Which may mean that tornadoes will be like rainfall: bigger storms and more drought . Believability: 240 ppm. It's an unusual prediction derived from experts, so make of that what you will. Confused? Don't be. The main point is this: It's possible that climate change will result in more storms like the one that demolished Moore. It's also possible that the atmospheric energy will only manifest in exceptional droughts and massive floods. It's sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure , in which each ending isn't one you'd choose. Correction: An earlier version of this article misrepresented Marshall Shepherd's expertise.

Iceland's prime minister is ready to ride the wave of melted polar ice caps to increased food production and export opportunities for his arctic island. During a recent interview, Minister\u00a0Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson said that climate change could open up new economic opportunities for the country, according to The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine . \"There\u2019s a water shortage, energy is becoming more expensive, land is in short supply and it is predicted that the cost of food will rise in the foreseeable future because of increased demand,\" Gunnlaugsson\u00a0said.\u00a0\"So there are great opportunities for Iceland there and we are mapping it out.\u201d Sorry about your luck, Bangladesh ! Gunnlaugsson\u00a0also\u00a0 referred to The World in 2050 , a book on climate change from a geologist at UCLA that argues, among other things, that eight Nordic countries will benefit from rising sea levels and melting glaciers. (At the moment glacial melt is a problem , not an opportunity, in Iceland.) Iceland's minister isn't the first Nordic country to see the money behind climate change: Greenland's ice has been melting at record rates, leading to increased interest in the minerals and resources\u00a0revealed by the ice. And Russia, along with the United States, Canada, Norway and Denmark, are all trying to extend their control of the Arctic \u2014 as the ice melts, it leads to more routes for cargo ships and places to drill for oil, writes  The National Journal . But Gunnlaugsson\u00a0comments came at a particularly tasteless time \u2014 the day after Monday's report by the\u00a0UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As The Wire's Philip Bump explained , the report was pretty bleak. Climate change means that water and food supplies will be affected, some species might go extinct, ocean levels are rising and heat waves and storms will intensify. But! If shipping lanes are opening up thanks to all that melting ice, and food prices are rising in other countries, Gunnlaugsson argued, that could lead to some choice business opportunities, according to the Iceland Review . Icelanders were not impressed by their prime minister's pragmatism, even if the economic pros end up outweighing the ecological cons for the country for a while.\u00a0Visir.is, a national news site, said the reaction among Icelanders on social media was negative.

{"id":null,"body":"During the rise of mammals, Earth's temperatures spiked in a scary way that the planet may experience again soon. They were strange days at the beginning of the age of mammals. The planet was still hungover from the astonishing disappearance of its marquee superstars, the dinosaurs. Earth\u2019s newest crater was still a smoldering system of hydrothermal vents, roiling under the Gulf of Mexico. In the wake of Armageddon our shell-shocked ancestors meekly negotiated new roles on a planet they inherited quite by accident. Before long, life settled into new rhythms: Earth hosted 50-foot-long boas sliding through steam-bath jungles, birds grew gigantic in imitation of their dearly departed cousins, and mildly modern mammals we might squint to recognize appeared. Within a few million years, loosed from under the iron heel of the vanished giants, they began to experiment. Early whales pranced across a Pakistani archipelago on all fours, testing out life in the water. The first lemur-like primates leapt from the treetops, and hoofed things of all varieties dashed through the forest. But the most striking feature of this early age of mammals is that it was almost unbelievably hot, so hot that around 50 million years ago there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks in the Arctic Circle. On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86  degrees  Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort. This is what you get in an ancient atmosphere with around 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide. If this number sounds familiar, 1,000 ppm of CO 2 is around what humanity is on pace to reach by the end of this century. That should be mildly concerning. \u201cYou put more CO 2 in the atmosphere and you get more warming, that\u2019s just super-simple physics that we figured out in the 19th century,\u201d says David Naafs, an organic geochemist at the University of Bristol. \u201cBut exactly how much it will warm by the end of the century, we don\u2019t know. Based on our research of these ancient climates, though, it\u2019s probably more than we thought.\u201d Last week, Naafs and colleagues released a study in Nature Geoscience that reconstructs temperatures on land during this ancient high-CO 2 hothouse of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs\u2014the sweltering launch to the age of mammals. And the temperatures they unearthed are unsurprisingly scorching. To study Earth\u2019s past, scientists need good rocks to study, and fortunately for geologists and fossil-fuel companies alike, the jungles and swamps of this early age of mammals left behind lots of coal. The Powder River Basin in the United States, for instance, is filled with fossil Paleocene swamplands that, when burned today, contribute about 10 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. Naafs\u2019 team studied examples of lower-quality coals called lignites, or fossilized peat. They had been collected around the world (everywhere from open-pit coal mines in Germany to outcrops in New Zealand), and spanned the late-Paleocene and early-Eocene epochs, from around 56 to 48 million years ago. They were able to reverse engineer the ancient climate by analyzing temperature-sensitive structures of lipids produced by fossil bacteria and archaea living in these bygone wetlands, and preserved for all time in the coal. The team found that, under this past regime of high CO 2 , in the ancient U.K., Germany, and New Zealand, life endured mean annual temperatures of 23 \u2013 29 degrees Celsius (73\u201384 degrees Fahrenheit) or 10\u201315 degrees Celsius (18\u201327 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than modern times. \u201cThese wetlands looked exactly how only tropical wetlands look at present, like the Everglades or the Amazon,\u201d Naafs says. \u201cSo Europe would look like the Everglades and a heat wave like we\u2019re currently experiencing in Europe would be completely normal. That is, it would be the everyday climate.\u201d That modern European heat wave has, in recent weeks, sent sunbathing Scandinavians and reindeer to the beach in temperatures topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the Arctic Circle. It has also ignited devastating wildfires across Greece and triggered an excruciating weekend for Spain and Portugal. But over 50 million years ago this would have been the baseline from about 45 to 60 degrees latitude. Under this broiling regime, with unprecedented heat as the norm, actual heat waves might have begun to take on an unearthly quality. \u201cPerhaps a heat wave in Europe would be something like 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for three weeks. We don\u2019t know.\u201d So that was life in the late Paleocene and early Eocene in the high mid-latitudes. But closer to the equator in this global sweat lodge, the heat might have been even more outrageous, shattering the limits of complex life. To see exactly how hot, Naafs\u2019 team also analyzed ancient lignite samples from India, which would have been in the tropics at the time\u2014that subcontinent still drifting across the Indian Ocean toward its eventual mountain-raising rendezvous with Asia. But unfortunately, the temperatures from these samples were maxed out. That is, they were too hot for his team to measure by the new methods they had developed. So it remains an open question just how infernal the tropics became in these early days of our ancestors, but some computers tasked with recreating this planet spit out the stuff of science fiction. \u201cSome climate models suggest that the tropics just became a dead zone with temperatures over 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) like in Africa and South America,\u201d says Naafs. \u201cBut we have no data so we don\u2019t know.\u201d Naafs\u2019 work fits into a larger developing picture of Earth as an almost unrecognizable greenhouse planet of the distant past. University of Colorado paleontologist Jaelyn Eberle recently returned to her office in Boulder from Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian High Arctic, where she\u2019s been doing research since the 1990s. Ellesmere is as far north as you can get before you fall off North America and run into P\u00e8re No\u00ebl drifting over pack ice. Here, featureless highlands overlook ice-choked fjords and a lone Peary\u2019s caribou might mingle with a dozen musk oxen under a vast Nunavut sky. There are also polar bears, but Eberle luckily hasn\u2019t had any run-ins so far\u2014though perspective can play tricks on you at the top of the world, and a snow-white artic hare on its hind legs at the appropriate distance can appear threatening enough. \u201cYou pick up your gun and get all nervous and worried and then look through your binoculars ... It\u2019s just a rabbit,\u201d says Eberle. But Eberle isn\u2019t venturing this far north just for the occasional hair-raising encounter with polar wildlife. Her target is warmer-weather fauna. Though there are no trees here at the top of the world, there are tree stumps. And they are around 50 million years old. \u201cThe fossil forests on Ellesmere are spectacular,\u201d Eberle says about the ecosystem entombed in the arctic soils. \u201cYou start really looking into them and you go, \u2018Wow. We are dealing with a rainforest.\u2019\u201d Eberle is a vertebrate paleontologist and though there\u2019s the aforementioned odd musk ox passing by her camp to consider, in the rocks below she has her pick of animals to study. \u201cYou\u2019ve got alligators, giant tortoises, primates, things like that. We have these big hippo-like animals called Coryphodon . You have tapirs\u2014so you\u2019ve got tapirs living pretty close to the North Pole in the early Eocene, which today\u2014clearly tapirs are not at the North Pole,\u201d she says, laughing. The presence of these animals suggests a very warm world indeed. And yet, there is a seeming disconnect, between traditional projections for future warming\u2014like those made by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts around 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (still frightening) and sea-level rise measured in mere inches (still frightening)\u2014and the scarcely recognizable Earths buried in the rocks and created under similar CO 2 regimes, like those that Eberle unearths. One obvious way to reconcile this disparity is by noticing that the changes to the ancient earth took place over hundreds-of-thousands to millions of years and (IPCC graphs notwithstanding) that time won\u2019t stop at the end of the 21st century. The changes that we\u2019ve already set in motion, unless we act rapidly to countervail them, will similarly take millennia to fully unfold. The last time CO 2 was at 400 ppm (as it is today) was 3 million years ago during the Pliocene epoch, when sea levels were perhaps 80 feet higher than today. Clearly the climate is not yet at equilibrium for a 400-ppm world. And it won\u2019t be for quite some time. And anyway, we\u2019re clearly not content to stop at just 400 ppm. If we do, in fact, push CO 2 up to around 1,000 ppm by the end of the century, the warming will persist and the earth will continue to change for what, to humans, is a practical eternity. And when the earth system finally does arrive at its equilibrium, it will most likely be in a climate state with no analog in the short evolutionary history of Homo sapiens . Most worryingly, the climate models that we depend on as a species to predict our future have largely failed to predict our sultry ancient past. And though the gulf is narrowing, and models are catching up, even those that come close to reproducing the hothouse of the early Eocene require injecting 16 times the modern level of CO 2 into the air to achieve it\u2014far beyond the rather meager doubling or tripling of CO 2 indicated by the rock record. Clearly we are missing something, and Naafs thinks that one of the missing ingredients in the models is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas which might help close the divide between model worlds and fossil worlds. \u201cWe know nothing about the methane cycle during these greenhouse periods,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know the hotter it gets the more methane comes out of these wetlands, but we know nothing about the methane cycle beyond the reach of ice cores which only goes back 800,000 years ... We know tropical wetlands pump much more methane into the atmosphere compared to [cooler] wetlands. And we know methane can actually amplify high-latitude warming, so maybe that\u2019s some of the missing feedback.\u201d In many ways these ancient worlds are not analogs to our own. We have to be careful when making comparisons between the two. The early age of mammals was a different world. The continents were in slightly different positions, leading to a vastly different ocean circulation and boundary conditions quite unlike our own world, 50 million years on\u2014with all the tectonic, oceanographic, and biological changes that come with such a yawning expanse of time. But artificially jam enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and Naafs thinks that many of the wildest features of the early age of mammals could be recreated. \u201cIf we were to burn all the fossil fuels and wait a few centuries we might return to this,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically every type of paleoclimate research that\u2019s being done shows that high CO 2 means that it\u2019s very warm. And when it gets very warm, it can be really, really, really warm.\u201d","headline":"Scientists Have Uncovered a Frightening Climate Change Precedent","article_name":566762.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/earths-scorching-hot-history\/566762\/","date_published":"2018-08-06 11:00:00","article_length":11408,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:23.426957","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/earths-scorching-hot-history\/566762\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. \u201cHell no!\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about climate change at the time.\u201d In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack\u2019s wood slat walls as if they didn\u2019t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn\u2019t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Barr\u2019s data would likely have remained the tinkerings of an amateur scientist were he not so close to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL), one of the most important phenology research sites in the world. During the last couple decades, scientists at the RMBL have become fascinated with climate change\u2019s impact on plants and animals in the high alpines, hoping to scale their discoveries into broader lessons about life in a warmer earth. But their research suffered from a dearth of long-term records. In Gothic, for example, the spring snow seemed to melt a little earlier. The flowers blossomed a little sooner. But without historical context, these little changes could not be understood for what they really were. The site of the RMBL was once a silver boomtown in the 1880s, but within a decade it\u2019d been abandoned for richer mines elsewhere. In 1928, a biology professor rediscovered the area and founded what is now a summer pilgrimage of scientists. Researchers at the lab sleep in cabins and university department presidents and lowly students share mess hall tables, working side-by-side on long-term conservation studies. One of the lab\u2019s longest-running studies is a wildflower research project started by ecologist David Inouye. The same year Barr would become Gothic\u2019s only permanent resident, in 1973, Inouye measured some 30 plots to study wildflowers. By recording when and how long flowers bloomed Inouye and a handful of scientist hoped to draw correlations to the insects and birds that feed upon them. This research has since been used in many studies and is particularly important to understanding how climate change alters flower blooming times, the animals that depend on them, and thus the rest of Gothic Mountain\u2019s ecology. And by extension, to high alpine environments everywhere. The idea for the study arose out of a casual conversation, and that is part of RMBL\u2019s beauty. A similar beautiful fluke would lead Inouye to discover Barr\u2019s 40 years of data. Barr had intended to spend one summer in Gothic as a research student. In 1972 he was 21 years old, a shy, skinny guy studying environmental science at Rutgers University. The summer before he\u2019d shoveled shit and hay at a dairy farm and he was ready for a change. The field of conservation was still small back then, so even though he had little experience, when he saw the RMBL was looking for help with a water chemistry project, Barr applied. One of the first newspaper interviews Barr gave\u2014long after he\u2019d become known in the nearby town as the eccentric mountain man\u2014 romanticized his escape to Gothic, painting him as Thoreauvian. \u201cHe climbed to a nearby mountain peak the day he made that decision and sat in the waning daylight\u2026 \u201d The reality is that he couldn\u2019t hack the regular world. \u00a0\u201cI was just getting more and more depressed,\u201d Barr, now 66 years old, told me. \u201cA lot of me moving out there the first few years was just me stabilizing; getting to be around quiet.\u201d Gothic is about 10 miles from the nearest town. In the winter the road is closed and it's unreachable except by backcountry skis on a trail that cuts through dangerous avalanche territory. His first winter, Barr lived in a tent as long as he could bear. When snow piled up he moved into the abandoned 8-by-10-foot mining shack. It had a wood-burning stove and a bed, but its true value lay in its messy chain of title. The RMBL seemed to think the cabin belonged to the U.S. Forest Service. And the Forest Service thought it belonged to the RMBL. A local man also claimed to own it, so amid this triangle of confusion Barr found a home. Barr seemed to spend all day that first winter chopping wood. He\u2019d wake before sunrise, eat, ski into the woods, cut down a dead tree, eat, haul it back, then split the logs for a fire. In the hope that it would keep him busy at night, and thinking that it might come in handy next winter, he began to track the snow levels and the wildlife on his treks into the woods. \u201cUnder kerosene light you can\u2019t do much,\u201d Barr told me. \u201cAnd after a few years I had something to compare each winter with.\u201d In the summer he took odd jobs, working on a hotshot crew fighting wildfires, and later washing dishes in the RMBL\u2019s kitchen. Each year, the RMBL seemed to operate on a prayer. No one tracked the bills, and the distracted scientists came and left without much thought for the lab\u2019s upkeep. In the late 1970s Barr became the unofficial caretaker, shutting off the water so the pipes wouldn\u2019t freeze, keeping an eye on the research equipment. In return the lab let him borrow its car parked at the bottom of the mountain so he could drive into town for supplies. Barr always considered himself a numbers guy, and as a kid growing up in Trenton, New Jersey, he kept detailed baseball stats on his favorite players. When the RMBL\u2019s then-director found out, he suggested Barr take an accounting class through the mail. In the early 1980s Barr became the lab\u2019s accountant. Around this same time Barr built his own home a half mile from the lab. He added solar panels and a greenhouse for vegetables, and a theater room with a projector to watch his favorite Bollywood films. With age he grew more relaxed around people. One year he skied into town to see a play at the local theater, and when he arrived he was the only person in the audience. The play\u2019s director wanted to call it off. But when everyone realized it was Barr seated there\u2014his long beard and string-bean body\u2014they put on the play anyway. As the RMBL\u2019s accountant, Barr became the first person researchers saw as they checked in\u2014as well the primary source of chocolate candy\u2014and in that way he became the lab\u2019s face. All the while he kept his records. Each stenographer\u2019s notebook lasted for three years of data, and Barr developed his own code. In the morning and night he logged snow levels, weather, and temperatures. For wildlife he invented his own number system, and in red he circled first sightings: the mammals emerging from hibernation, or the first calls for spring from the robins, the flickers, and especially important to Inouye would be the broad-tailed hummingbird. Having lived in the area nearly three decades, Barr had become good friends with many of the scientists, and because Inouye had visited RMBL as long as Barr had lived there, the two talked often in the summer. Even so, it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that Inouye learned of Barr\u2019s priceless trove of data. It happened during a conversation no one clearly recalls. By the end of it, Barr agreed to send Inouye some of his research. \u201cI realized right away what a valuable treasure it was,\u201d Inouye told me of the moment he saw Barr\u2019s work. \u201cI knew what type of thing could be done with access to historical records.\u201d Barr\u2019s notes have now appeared in dozens of research papers focused on climate change science. His notebooks on the first and last snow, the snowpack levels in between, and when hibernating animals wake and when the birds return to the the high alpine environment have provided an unexpected glimpse back into a world scientists never recorded. And from the past, scientists have gained a little more understanding of the the world\u2019s warming future. Hydrologists like Rosemary Carroll, who works at the Desert Research Institute, use Barr\u2019s snowpack data and other sources to model groundwater flows to the Colorado River. Forty million people rely on the river to pipe water to their faucets, and Carroll\u2019s work\u2014with the help of Barr\u2019s data\u2014will help shape water policy for Southwestern cities. Inouye has included Barr\u2019s records in several studies, and collectively his work has become some of the most significant indication that climate change is rearranging mountain ecosystems more dramatically and quickly than anyone imagined. In his work with wildflowers Inouye understood that first flowering came about a month earlier now than when he\u2019d begun the project 40 years ago. He also understood that the male broad-tailed hummingbird\u2019s wings make a whistling sound, and indeed Barr had tracked the bird's return each spring. Together with Barr\u2019s weather and snow melt, Inouye was able to show how climate change\u2019s impact on a single flower might mean the end of broad-tailed hummingbird migration in the region. The hummingbird relies on nectar from the glacier lily\u2014so much so that it synced its migration to arrive in Gothic just before it blooms. To adjust to warmer springs, however, the lily now flowers 17 days earlier than it did four decades ago. In two more decades it\u2019s likely the broad-tailed hummingbird will completely miss the glacier lily\u2019s nectar. This widening seasonal imbalance is called phenological mismatch, and has become a major concern as scientists learn more about climate change. In Gothic, this will impact not just broad-tailed hummingbirds, but also butterflies, bees, hibernating mammals, and the animals that depend on all those animals. These same dynamics will play out across the Rocky Mountains, and similar alpine ecosystems across the world. Barr still wakes each day in his cabin before dawn to log the snow levels. He buys his wood now, which has freed up some time, and he has started the dreary process of converting his notebooks into spreadsheets. Sometimes Barr is credited as a contributor on reports that use his data; sometimes not. This year, however, he\u2019s won some much deserved recognition. He is a character in a not-yet-released documentary called End of Snow ; and this summer the RMBL named a building after him: The Billy Barr Community Center. \u201cSome day I\u2019ll die,\u201d Barr said, and people will ask: \u201cWho the hell is it named after\u2014this Billy Barr?\u201d","headline":"The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science","article_name":512198.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/billy-barr-climate-change\/512198\/","date_published":"2017-01-12 13:00:00","article_length":10923,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:23.782611","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/01\/billy-barr-climate-change\/512198\/","source":"atlantic"}

The list of announced candidates keeps growing. Progressives, women, African Americans, midwesterners\u2014the field has multiples of everything. Except in the case of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who will be the only climate-change candidate when he announces his bid for the presidency in Seattle on Friday morning.

And by making the announcement at a solar-installation company, he\u2019s chosen his venue to make a point: This isn\u2019t just about saving the planet, but about how much money can be made in moving toward clean energy. \u201cWhatever the situation is now, it\u2019s going to be worse two years from now on the peril side, and it\u2019s going to be better on the promise side through clean-energy jobs,\u201d Inslee said in an interview in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week, after he\u2019d already made his decision to run. \u201cSo the dynamic is, wherever we are today, by the time of the November election climate will be a more important issue in the electorate, I believe.\u201d He\u2019ll call his campaign the \u201cClimate Mission Tour,\u201d and kick it off in Iowa, followed by stops in Nevada and California. Among his early backers: Bill Nye, as in Bill Nye the Science Guy, who\u2019s made fighting climate change a major cause. \u201cHe\u2019s a science-based guy,\u201d Nye said of Inslee in an interview on Thursday evening, recalling how he first met him years ago on a kayaking trip when the governor was in Congress. \u201cHe can contribute a lot to getting progressives focused.\u201d Read: The 3 big things that people misunderstand about climate change Inslee has been preparing to run over the past two months, traveling to New Hampshire and Nevada in January. He\u2019s put together a staff and a launch video produced by a couple whose previous clients include the musicians Ed Sheeran and Macklemore. But Inslee didn\u2019t need to invest in polling or focus groups to see if he\u2019s right about how panicked people are about climate change. He has a February poll from the Center for American Progress that said the 2020 presidential race is wide open, and that climate change has become, in the survey\u2019s words, \u201ca key motivating issue.\u201d Climate change was the top priority for 46 percent of the Democrats in the poll, behind only health care, at 47 percent. The Green New Deal and moving to 100 percent clean energy by 2050 had huge support, too. Having a clear plan for addressing the climate crisis, the pollsters wrote, \u201chelps voters believe that a presidential candidate is serious and forward thinking.\u201d Inslee, who has been in politics for 30 years, said polls like that help give him a gut feeling that the voters are with him, and that they want more than just talk. He noted that he\u2019s been focused on reducing carbon-dioxide emissions since his first congressional campaign, in 1992. He went on to win that Republican-leaning district, though he lost the seat two years later in a Republican wave. \u201cIt is the issue; it is the primary issue; it is the foremost issue. This has to be the organizing issue of your administration,\u201d he said of climate change. \u201cIt can\u2019t be one agency; it can\u2019t be check the box. It has to be the priority. I think it will be revealed who\u2019s got the chops, who\u2019s got the passion, and who\u2019s willing to take the risk to run on this subject and say it is a priority.\u201d It\u2019s early in the race, but Inslee starts significantly behind, jumping in as a mostly unknown weeks after other candidates made it official and months after many began seriously sketching out plans to win. He\u2019ll also be behind in fundraising, though he will be the first announced 2020 Democratic candidate with an affiliated super PAC supporting him, despite the energy in the party against the big-money groups that has kept most other candidates from using them. The point of his campaign, Inslee said, is building a national mandate for the major changes America would need to make to actually start addressing the climate crisis. And for those who try to write him off as just a single-issue candidate, Inslee pointed out how many jobs there are in shifting to clean energy, and how much of a national-security issue it is for America to be able to sustain itself without being dependent on other countries for oil and gas. \u201cThe beauty of it is, it\u2019s not a single issue,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s all-encompassing.\u201d","headline":"Jay Inslee\u2019s Risky Bet for 2020","article_name":583900.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2019\/03\/jay-inlsee-joins-2020-field-climate-change-candidate\/583900\/","date_published":"2019-03-01 12:00:00","article_length":5080,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:24.338715","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2019\/03\/jay-inlsee-joins-2020-field-climate-change-candidate\/583900\/","source":"atlantic"}

Every week, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . It is one of the strangest feelings that modern transportation can afford: You\u2019ve just gotten on a train and are gazing out the window. And then, slowly, the scene outside begins to move, and for a split second your mind cannot tell whether the train is moving or the world is. I wonder if President Joe Biden, who as a senator used to commute from Delaware to Washington, D.C., on Amtrak, is feeling like that right now. For the past year, his administration has pursued an ambitious plan to prepare the United States for the risks of the 21st century: Biden wants to fight climate change, reinvigorate American industry, and get ready to compete\u2014economically, culturally, perhaps even militarily\u2014with China. But he has been frustrated by a different kind of economic upheaval. The outside world\u2014coronavirus variants, supply-chain snarls, scorching inflation\u2014has stymied many of his goals, even while Biden has overseen the strongest economic growth since 1982. It doesn\u2019t help that Congress\u2019s ongoing failure to pass the Build Back Better Act has kept Biden from bringing much of his decarbonization plan to fruition. But a set of recent announcements shows that Biden\u2019s biggest ambitions for the climate and the economy are not quite dead yet. Yesterday, the White House unveiled a slew of policies aimed at overhauling the U.S. industrial sector in order to reduce its planet-warming carbon pollution. Many of the policies have bipartisan backing\u2014they were authorized in last year\u2019s infrastructure bill . These policies are a big deal because they could help solve one of decarbonization\u2019s thorniest problems: how to make steel, concrete, chemicals, and other major industrial products in a zero-carbon way. These products typically rely on fossil fuels to generate intense heat or provide a raw-material input, which is part of why the industrial sector is responsible for more than 20 percent of global emissions. However crucial these policies are for the planet, they are arguably even more important as a matter of political economy. They signal a profound and bipartisan change in how the federal government presides over the economy: In order to bring new technologies to market, Washington is willing to act as an investor, matchmaker, and consumer for fledgling innovations. It will design markets to serve public needs, cut loans that banks won\u2019t write, and ensure competition among linchpin firms. The government, in short, is ready to care about stuff again, the real-world economy of flesh and steel. That it is furthering its climate and China goals at the same time is exactly the point. To understand why, look at the first of these policies: By the middle of this decade, the government will spend $9.5 billion to boost hydrogen production in the United States. Hydrogen can play many roles in the quest to decarbonize industrial products, because, like fossil fuels, it can generate intense heat and store chemical energy. The Department of Energy aims to cut the cost of making hydrogen with renewable electricity at least 80 percent by the end of the decade. That\u2019s about when it would become price-competitive with oil, gas, and coal, according to the consulting group Wood Mackenzie . In the past few decades, the government might have tried to reduce hydrogen\u2019s cost by funding academic research and development efforts on new technologies. (Even the most conservative presidents have supported pure R&D, because companies have no incentive to conduct pure science.) Yet most of the newly announced money\u2014some $8 billion\u2014will go not to R&D or research grants, but to actually building factories. The Department of Energy will construct four \u201cHydrogen Regional Innovation Hubs\u201d across the country. This reflects a view that technological progress emerges not from basic research alone, but from scientists, engineers, and workers solving problems together. As the economic analyst Dan Wang has written , that kind of collaborative process used to be what made Detroit and Silicon Valley special; in recent years, China has tried to emulate that magic by building its own technological clusters . Now the U.S. is reviving its old approach. You can see another new approach in the Department of Energy\u2019s $1 billion project, also announced yesterday, aimed at bringing down the cost of hydrogen electrolysis , the process of using electricity to split water into its constituent oxygen and hydrogen. Instead of funding only early-stage research, the project allows the DOE to intervene at any point in the technology\u2019s path to market in order to bring down the cost of electrolysis. Those policies focus on increasing the supply of hydrogen in the economy. Another set of policies in the package will try to create demand for zero-carbon industrial goods. The federal government is, after all, one of the world\u2019s biggest consumers , buying $650 billion of goods and services a year. The Biden administration is creating a \u201cBuy Clean\u201d task force that will use the government\u2019s power to help bring low-carbon steel, concrete, and asphalt to the market. If these enticements help a low-carbon concrete maker come to market, the ramifications would be huge: The world\u2019s appetite for concrete is voracious\u2014we produce 30 billion tons of the stuff every year\u2014and concrete making alone is responsible for 5 to 10 percent of annual global CO2 emissions. An American firm would have a major advantage if it was the first to market with a zero-carbon concrete. Finally, one of the most important efforts\u2014and the one most likely to fly under the radar\u2014is that the new Buy Clean task force will begin to calculate the carbon emissions \u201cembodied\u201d in various industrial products from American companies. It will ask, in essence, how much carbon pollution was emitted to make a ton of steel from a certain refinery in Ohio, or a ton of cement from a plant in Alabama. Although this may sound like an accounting exercise, it is a necessary precondition for the Biden administration\u2019s ambitious trade policy. The American industrial sector is less carbon-intensive than that of virtually any other country (except the European Union\u2019s). Last year, that relative climate friendliness allowed the White House to broker a \u201cgreen steel deal \u201d that gave American steelmakers access to the European market despite the U.S.\u2019s lack of any carbon price. But in order to cut more of those deals, the government must know the emissions embodied in various goods. Not all of these industrial policies are new. The ones that stoke demand are some of the oldest innovation-boosting plays in the government\u2019s book. Decades ago, they were used to establish American industries in semiconductors and solar panels . But they fell out of discussion until Operation Warp Speed, the Trump-era program that successfully developed COVID-19 vaccines within a year, demonstrated their efficacy. The Biden administration is trying to build on that success. More broadly, this package is trying to solve the problem of how American climate policy should relate to the world. The thing is, when Republicans point out that the U.S. emits only 11 percent of global greenhouse-gas pollution each year, they\u2019re right (although their follow-up point, that therefore the U.S. should give up on fighting climate change, is dead wrong). The U.S. cannot solve climate change by itself\u2014no country can. Still, Washington can make decarbonization far easier and cheaper for the world. America remains the global hegemon\u2014culturally, financially, technologically. When poorer countries are \u201cdeveloping,\u201d they are, the assumption goes, developing to become more like the United States . Our superpower status has, with some exceptions, generally been a disaster for the climate: We have exported our car-centric transportation system abroad, extracted resources at terrible expense, and encouraged the global economy\u2019s oil dependence. In the 2010s, SUVs\u2014another quintessentially American cultural export\u2014were the second-biggest cause of rising climate pollution . But if the U.S. is able to establish what a new zero-carbon lifestyle looks like, if it is able to develop competitive zero-carbon industries, then that too will shape the rest of the world\u2019s development. And if the U.S. can sell some of its zero-carbon industrial goods to other countries to help them build net-zero energy systems, buildings, and transportation networks? Then the Biden administration\u2014or any future climate-concerned presidency\u2014would really have some options. Biden\u2019s plan, of course, could still fail. If Senate Democrats fail to broker a deal over the essential climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act , broader defeat for Biden\u2019s agenda will be very likely. And even if some legislation  gets through, Biden\u2019s hand is still not ideal. If it turns out that Americans are too wedded to the status quo\u2014if nobody actually wants to live by zero-carbon industrial infrastructure, such as power plants, solar farms, and transmission lines \u2014then the plan will fail. Biden may yet move the world. Or the world could move him.","headline":"The White House Is Going After One of Climate Change\u2019s Thorniest Problems","article_name":622810.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/biden-climate-factories-industrial-sector\/622810\/","date_published":"2022-02-16 13:43:00","article_length":9368,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:24.808437","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/biden-climate-factories-industrial-sector\/622810\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u2026 but he won\u2019t cop to it. The newest columnist at The New York Times is Bret Stephens, a 43-year-old Never Trumper and the former editor-in-chief of the The Jerusalem Post. The Times picked him up from The Wall Street Journal, where he helped edit the opinion section. Five years ago, Stephens won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary. Stephens mostly writes about foreign policy, but for more than a decade, he has also weighed in on climate change. In the best world, the world where his views resemble Theresa May\u2019s or Angela Merkel\u2019s, he could be a terrific asset to the Times\u2019 climate-starved editorial section, the most important opinion page in journalism. An American conservative who understands modern climate science is a rarity. That may be too much to hope for. After he was hired, some critics labeled Stephens a \u201c climate-science denier .\u201d Stephens rejects this charge, but in fact his views are not even so coherent as to be ruled denial. Instead, without him ever acknowledging it, his opinion on climate change has evolved considerably over time. The only constant is his repeated reassurances to the reader not to worry: It\u2019s the environmentalists who are wrong. Stephens hasn\u2019t written a column for the Times yet, but he has revealed what presuppositions he brings to the job, leaving behind hundreds of columns at the Journal. On Wednesday, he gave an exceptional interview to Jeff Stein at Vox . Here\u2019s a tidbit: Stephens : Since 1880\u2014and I\u2019d have to look it up\u2014but according to the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], we\u2019ve had about 1.7 degrees of rising temperatures. The best scientific evidence suggests temperatures are rising, and the best scientific evidence suggests man-made anthropogenic carbon emissions have some substantial thing to do with that. However, does that mean the trend will continue forever? We don\u2019t know. Does this mean we will reach the upper bounds of what climate scientists fear? We aren\u2019t sure. There are uncertainties in all of this. There is an astonishing leap between the second and third paragraph. Stephens is arguing the following: The meteorological data shows that the world is getting warmer. Anthropogenic carbon emissions are causing that warmth, just as scientists have been warning for decades. But if we keep emitting carbon emissions, or do anything to limit our release of them, well, then, who knows what will happen? This is wishful thinking. If we keep emitting carbon dioxide, the world will keep warming, thanks to the same basic chemistry that got us here. Greenhouse gases allow the warm rays of the sun to pass through them toward Earth. After those rays hit the surface, some of their energy bounces back into space in the form of infrared light. But greenhouse gases don\u2019t allow that infrared light to pass through, reflecting it back toward the surface and trapping heat in the climate system. In a nutshell, this is the problem of global warming. Scientists have not updated their understanding of those facts in 30 years. They have expanded them, learning from the geological history of past climates that adding even more carbon to the atmosphere will not eventually reverse this trend. The more CO2 in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. Yet this is not even what makes this passage astonishing. By admitting that \u201cthe best scientific evidence suggests man-made anthropogenic carbon emissions have some substantial thing to do with that,\u201d Stephens is reversing a once-dearly held position that climate change was a mass neurosis among liberals. \u201cLast week marked the 20th anniversary of the mass hysteria phenomenon known as global warming. Much of the science has since been discredited,\u201d he wrote on July 1, 2008. Since the hottest year on record was 1998, he said, climate change had been disproven altogether. (1998 was an El Ni\u00f1o year, which are often unusually warm, no matter the underlying climate trend.) Later, in another column, he wondered if the climate concerned were driven by the \u201ctotalitarian impulse.\u201d \u201cFor the anti-Semite, the problems of the world can invariably be ascribed to the Jews; for the Communist, to the capitalists. And as the list above suggests, global warming has become the fill-in-the-blank explanation for whatever happens to be the problem,\u201d he wrote . (This column has since disappeared from The Wall Street Journal \u2019s website.) Nine years have passed since the publication of his \u201cmass hysteria\u201d column. All but two of those years them have been warmer than 1998. Six of them have set new records for being the hottest ever measured: 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Our current annum is set to be the second-warmest ever measured. And every major recounting of the global temperature trend since 2008 has found a steady, four-decade-long warming trend. Stephens recognizes some of these realities now, but he never cops to the fact that his views had ever been different. In a 2015 column, he said that temperatures were rising but suggested the consequences of that change would be minor. (The relatively small amount of warming so far has already disturbed Arctic ecosystems and overwhelmed the U.S. coastal-flooding insurance system .) So, today, when Stephens concedes that that \u201ctemperatures are rising,\u201d and the greenhouse effect is real, you have to wonder: When did he change his mind? And why does he still doubt that warming will continue? Later in the Vox interview, he seems to admit that some climate mitigation might make sense: The best argument made on behalf of climate mitigation strategies is even if there\u2019s a small chance your house catches fire, you take out insurance. That\u2019s perfectly sensible. And you can make a perfectly sensible argument that even if we\u2019re not 100 percent sure we\u2019re facing a catastrophic climate future, we should take out a host of insurance policies to mitigate carbon emissions. But then the intelligent question is: \u201cHow much are you paying for insurance?\u201d I think a risk-avoidance model makes a lot of sense when thinking about climate change. But Stephens\u2019 point here is incomprehensible: We are barely paying anything right now. The most substantive climate policy in the United States is a tax credit for renewable energy that is set to expire in the next decade. You can\u2019t talk about climate policy only in metaphor: You have to use numbers. And when it comes to numbers, energy and climate experts say that far more policy is needed to keep global temperatures below two degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. For instance, we would have to halve fossil-fuel production in the 2020s. And then we would have to halve it again in the 2030s. And then we would have to start pulling carbon dioxide out of the air. Those estimates may be unattainable\u2014honestly, that\u2019s kind of the point of putting them out there\u2014but you can\u2019t ignore the chasm between our current policy and something resembling a reasonable insurance policy. I\u2019ll stop going point-by-point. But you have to wonder: Does Stephens care about updating his audience, just as he once updated his excoriating views on the existence of global warming? Or does he care more about showing that environmentalists are weak thinkers, even as the facts shift beneath him?","headline":"The Newest 'New York Times' Columnist Has Flip-Flopped on Climate Change","article_name":524361.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/04\/bret-stephens-climate-change-nyt-flip-flop\/524361\/","date_published":"2017-04-26 18:47:11","article_length":7221,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:25.553039","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/04\/bret-stephens-climate-change-nyt-flip-flop\/524361\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Previously light on policy, his campaign has\u2014for the moment\u2014the most detailed plan on climate change in the Democratic primary. The first 2020 presidential candidate out with a comprehensive climate-change policy is \u2026 Beto O\u2019Rourke? I was surprised, too. The former congressman from Texas, whose campaign has previously been somewhat skimpy on policy proposals, debuted on Monday a $1.5 trillion proposal meant to rapidly move the economy away from fossil fuels and slow the advance of climate change. \u201cWe will ensure we are at net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by the year 2050, and that we are halfway there by 2030,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a video posted to Twitter . His plan calls climate change \u201cthe greatest threat we face\u2014one which will test our country, our democracy, and every single one of us.\u201d O\u2019Rourke says his proposal is the \u201cmost ambitious climate plan in the history of the United States.\u201d Certainly it is\u2014so far\u2014the most wide-ranging climate plan debuted by any Democratic presidential candidate in the 2020 race, though a number of contenders say their own proposals will come out shortly. And it makes for a dramatic contrast with the agenda of President Donald Trump , who has repealed major federal rules restricting carbon pollution and staffed the federal government with former fossil-fuel lobbyists . It certainly doesn\u2019t lack for length. The new proposal, running more than 2,500 words , has nearly doubled the policy content of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign. Previously, his website devoted only one page to policy , detailing a 3,000-word \u201cvision for America\u201d that ranged across 13 different issues. Read: O\u2019Rourke mostly gets a pass for his lack of specifics There are several different ways to address climate change through federal policy. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan tries to do all of them at once. First, the government can try to make carbon pollution more expensive by regulating or taxing it. O\u2019Rourke says that on his first day in office, he would reverse all of Trump\u2019s climate-related orders, rejoin the Paris Agreement, and tell the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict air pollution from power plants and car tailpipes again. He would also ask Congress to pass a \u201clegally enforceable standard\u201d that would force the United States to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050. What is this \u201cstandard\u201d? Though the proposal\u2019s language is cleverly vague, O\u2019Rourke seems to be describing some kind of carbon tax\u2014his exact language is \u201ca clear price signal to the market\u201d\u2014that scales up as the mid-century deadline approaches. Second, the government can try to make clean energy cheaper. O\u2019Rourke says he will spend $200 billion on a new R&D program to study technologies that can reach his zero-carbon goal. Finally, the government can buy things: solar panels, wind turbines, public transit, electric-car charging stations, and adaptations (such as seawalls) that will help people prepare for the worsened weather to come. O\u2019Rourke says he would ask Congress to cut tax breaks for oil companies, using the resulting $1.5 trillion to fund new climate-ready infrastructure. O\u2019Rourke also promises to connect $500 billion in federal spending\u2014spending that would happen anyway\u2014to his climate goals. The federal government already tries to \u201cbuy American,\u201d favoring U.S. companies and manufacturers; under O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan, it would also \u201cbuy clean,\u201d favoring steel, glass, and cement produced in a climate-friendly way. Some scholars associated with the Green New Deal have proposed similar new programs . O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal goes much further than either Trump- or Obama-era policy. It will also face virtually guaranteed political opposition . But it combines a mix of approaches. Some of his proposals require new congressional legislation; some can happen through annual budget negotiations; some can be authorized by the president. Take his proposed advanced-energy R&D program. The United States actually has an active energy R&D program, called ARPA-E , or the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. Trump has proposed closing ARPA-E every year since he took office, but some Republicans and Democrats in Congress have resisted him. As such, ARPA-E now has a budget of $366 million \u2014a record haul for the small agency. But that all-time record is still 550 times smaller than O\u2019Rourke\u2019s $200 billion proposal. O\u2019Rourke says that $200 billion is \u201can amount equal to what we invested in our nation\u2019s journey to the Moon,\u201d but I think that may actually understate the monetary scale of the proposal\u2019s ambition: In inflation-adjusted dollars , $200 billion exceeds the cost of the 15-year Apollo program . Read: The Democratic Party wants to make climate policy exciting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s climate ambition is noteworthy in part because, as a candidate, he has not had the easiest relationship with the environmental left. Earlier this month, he declined to turn down money from fossil-fuel workers , saying only that he would refuse donations from oil executives, industry trade groups, and their political-action committees. In December, the environmental nonprofit Oil Change USA said that O\u2019Rourke had violated its \u201cno fossil-fuel money\u201d pledge , kicking him off its approved list after he accepted too many donations over $200 from fossil-fuel employees. The disagreement gets at a deeper problem: whether the national Democratic Party should treat the fossil-fuel industry like it once treated the tobacco industry\u2014as an evil enterprise and political enemy\u2014or like it now treats the pharmaceutical industry\u2014as an important part of the economy that must be tamed and transformed. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign suggests that he thinks the latter approach can coexist with ambitious climate policy. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Governor Jay Inslee\u2014whose entire primary campaign is focused on climate change \u2014have taken the opposite bet, forswearing large fossil-fuel donations . While other candidates have climate proposals in the works, O\u2019Rourke now has the most detailed one in the Democratic primary. Warren has released a detailed proposal for public lands that overlaps with some of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s climate agenda. (Both candidates would, for instance, ban all new fossil-fuel projects on federal land, as would many of their competitors in the field .) Sanders has endorsed a Green New Deal , though provided little detail about it. And Inslee is expected to debut his own climate proposals shortly. The O\u2019Rourke plan seemed to catch many climate groups off guard. Even Greenpeace USA, which calls for aggressive climate action, said in a statement that the plan \u201csurprised\u201d it and was \u201can important contribution.\u201d \u201cI did not expect him to come out first with it, and I didn\u2019t expect the rhetoric in it to peg so closely with the Green New Deal framing,\u201d Greg Carlock , a policy researcher at the leftist advocacy group Data for Progress , told me. \u201cIt sets at least an expectation that other candidates have to react to.\u201d While Carlock said the plan could be more detailed\u2014he called its proposed $1.5 trillion in new funding \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d\u2014it reflects \u201ca good consensus that the U.S. has to do a lot more, a lot faster.\u201d He judged it to sit roughly between the climate policies adopted by President Barack Obama and those favored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. One of the few groups to criticize the O\u2019Rourke plan: the Sunrise Movement, the youth-led activism corps that helped launch the Green New Deal to national recognition last year. \u201cHe gets a lot right in this plan,\u201d said Varshini Prakash , the group\u2019s executive director, in a statement. But she said that O\u2019Rourke should instead set 2030 as a carbon-free goal for the United States. (It is unclear that it is possible for the United States to meet the 2030 goal without a near-revolutionary upheaval in the national energy system.) And Carlock said that, regardless, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan would needle other candidates into similar specificity: \u201cIf every candidate comes out with their vision, and we can debate that in the public sphere, that\u2019s good.\u201d","headline":"Why Beto\u2019s Climate Plan Is So Surprising","article_name":588328.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/beto-2020-why-his-climate-change-plan-surprises-experts\/588328\/","date_published":"2019-04-30 11:00:00","article_length":8083,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:26.012457","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/beto-2020-why-his-climate-change-plan-surprises-experts\/588328\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"New research argues that global warming added to problems that caused Syria's civil war Before civil war engulfed Syria, the Middle Eastern nation suffered through a punishing drought. That drought\u2014Syria's worst in recorded history\u2014helped create a powder keg of civil and political unrest that erupted into violent conflict during the spring of 2011. And according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science s on Monday, climate change was likely a catalyst of the bone-dry conditions that played a role in the advent of the Syrian civil war. \"The severity of the drought, which was made more likely by climate change, added to other stressors, led to the unraveling of Syrian society,\" Richard Seager, an author of the study and a climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory said in an interview. As many as 1.5 million Syrians moved from the countryside to already-overcrowded cities after the drought that began in 2006 led to massive crop failures. Bashar al-Assad's government did little to aid the internally displaced people, a policy of inaction that fueled growing resentment toward the regime and set the stage for the Syrian uprising. Journalists and political analysts alike have speculated that drought catalyzed conflict in Syria. But the research published Monday is the first major scientific study to link the parched conditions to climate change. It is nearly impossible to pin a single extreme weather event on global warming. And researchers readily admit that they cannot prove that climate change caused Syria's drought. But the study shows that rising temperatures and less frequent rainfall spurred by rising greenhouse-gas emissions have increased the odds that droughts like the one that ravaged Syria will occur across the Middle East. The study's conclusion adds to a growing body of scientific research linking climate change to violent conflict. A study published in Science in 2013 found that rising temperatures increased the risk of civil and political unrest around the world. The Pentagon has also warned that global warming accelerates \"political instability, and social tensions\u2014conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\" The drying that is occurring will also affect Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Iraq, and Afghanistan, Seager said. \"This is an area of the world likely to see more environmental stress in a place that's already conflict-prone.\"","headline":"Scientists Link Climate Change to Syrian War ","article_name":443820.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/03\/scientists-link-climate-change-to-syrian-war\/443820\/","date_published":"2015-03-02 15:00:02","article_length":2475,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:26.100804","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/03\/scientists-link-climate-change-to-syrian-war\/443820\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"John Ruskin\u2019s warnings about a \u201cplague-wind\u201d offer one way of looking at the Paris deal. The first time John Ruskin noticed the gray clouds of the \u201cplague-wind\u201d was in 1871, decades into the industrial era . Walking home from work at the University of Oxford one spring day, the renowned English art critic looked skyward, to the \u201cdry black veil which no ray of sunshine\u201d could penetrate, and then back to earth, where the leaves of trees shook \u201cnot violently, but enough to show the passing to and fro of a strange, bitter, blighting wind.\u201d Only the wind proved not to be so strange. In the months that followed, he repeatedly witnessed the same weather pattern. That July, the 52-year-old Ruskin committed his observations to writing. Never in a lifetime of monitoring nature\u2019s movements  had he seen such springs and summers. The origins of this mysterious meteorological change demanded scientific investigation, he argued. Where did the plague-wind come from? Was it caused by the smoky belch of heavy industry, or another source? With rigorous scientific experimentation, could the wind be made to consist of something else? The scientific men are busy as ants, examining the sun and the moon, and the seven stars, and can tell me all about them, I believe, by this time; and how they move, and what they are made of. And I do not care, for my part, two copper spangles how they move, nor what they are made of. I can\u2019t move them any other way than they go, nor make them of anything else, better than they are made. But I would care much and give much, if I could be told where this bitter wind comes from, and what it is made of. For, perhaps, with forethought, and fine laboratory science, one might make it of something else. It looks partly as if it were made of poisonous smoke; very possibly it may be: there are at least two hundred furnace chimneys in a square of two miles on every side of me. But mere smoke would not blow to and fro in that wild way. It looks more to me as if it were made of dead men\u2019s souls\u2014such of them as are not gone yet where they have to go, and may be flitting hither and thither, doubting, themselves, of the fittest place for them. Ruskin cited these musings in an 1884 lecture in London on \u201cthe plague-wind of the eighth decade of years in the nineteenth century; a period which will assuredly be recognized in future meteorological history as one of phenomena hitherto unrecorded in the courses of nature.\u201d The lecture is often read as one of the earliest expressions of modern environmentalism. But such a reading is probably simplistic. For one thing, Ruskin was not the only 19th-century figure to glimpse and grapple with the the Industrial Revolution\u2019s impact on the planet; decades before him, for example, the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt warned that humankind was despoiling the Earth through deforestation and industrial emissions. Nor was Ruskin necessarily railing against industrialism. He may have been troubled by the \u201csulphurous chimney-pot vomit of blackguardly cloud\u201d looming above him, but he wasn\u2019t unequivocally opposed to Britain\u2019s newfound manufacturing might. He also suggested that the plague-wind had more to do with human vices in general than industrial pollution in particular; his mention of \u201cdead men\u2019s souls\u201d was an allusion to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, and the divine or natural retribution that could result from phenomena like warfare, which threaten the symbiosis between man and nature. He appeared to be calling for further study into cause and effect, and for human introspection, not the shuttering of Britain\u2019s chimneys. As the geographer Denis Cosgrove wrote in a 1995 analysis of the plague-wind lecture, \u201cAttempts to appropriate [Ruskin] for \u2018Green\u2019 anti-industrialism are weakened by his remarks upon the beauties of London enhanced by its vast smoke cloud.\u201d According to Cosgrove, the phenomenon explored by Ruskin, an on-again, off-again Christian , \u201cis a corrupted exhalation of earth, a provocation to the human imagination by a nature abused not so much by industrial exploitation as by the inability of the nations to lead harmonious lives according to those divinely ordered geographical \u2018statutes,\u2019 statutes which are simultaneously ecological, social and theological.\u201d Two days after the lecture, a newspaper article scoffed at Ruskin\u2019s theories. \u201cWe may not all agree with him that storm-clouds are depraved characters, and have been infected by the various vices of the age,\u201d it noted. \u201cIt seems, on the whole, a more plausible hypothesis that Mr. Ruskin, as he gets on in years, is more sensitive to disagreeable weather.\u201d But a 1907 study by John W. Graham on Britain\u2019s \u201csmoke problem\u201d\u2014a study commissioned by a guild that Ruskin had founded\u2014argued that Ruskin\u2019s predictions had been vindicated, and grounded in all-too-real trends. Graham noted that in the 30 years since Ruskin first observed the plague-wind, the country\u2019s consumption of coal, including coal exported to an industrializing Europe, had doubled. Ruskin, Graham wrote, had never been convinced that the plague-wind arose from smoke; \u201cto his mind it appeared something like a visible form of heavenly displeasure for the sins of the [modern] world.\u201d And yet, by 1907, it had become apparent that \u201cthe upper air did not always have time to become cleansed each day from the gases and carbon which rise into it : there is not enough free space at hand, and an unclean atmosphere blocks what was the serene expanse of the sky.\u201d However you interpret Ruskin\u2019s disquiet about the plague-wind\u2014this searching sense, early on in the industrial age, that something was amiss in the natural world\u2014his words resonated with me in the context of the landmark climate agreement announced over the weekend in Paris. The deal , ratified by 195 countries, identifies its own bitter wind, noting that \u201cclimate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet.\u201d With 185 nations submitting plans of varying ambition to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, and developed countries pledging to provide at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to help them mitigate their emissions and adapt to climate change, the pact nods to where this bitter wind blows from. In setting the non-binding goals of keeping global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and achieving zero net greenhouse-gas emissions in the second half the 21st century, while not explicitly mentioning the fossil fuels that produce these emissions, the agreement winks at what the bitter wind is made of. And, drawing on forethought and the fruits of recent science, the climate deal suggests that the wind might someday be made of something else, something other than carbon dioxide. As my colleague Rob Meyer writes , \u201cThe Paris talks were not meant to hatch an all-encompassing plan to save the world, once and for all. Rather, they were conceived as a way to send a signal. Negotiators hope the Paris agreement will say to the banks and investors of the world\u2014the barons of Capital, and thus historic possibility\u2014that the world really, really means it about this greener-future thing.\u201d A key question now is whether the market heeds that signal and rapidly redirects investment toward technology for a low-carbon world, thus driving down the price of renewable energy. And then there\u2019s another critical question: Even if the market bets on carbon emissions peaking soon, is there still sufficient time to ward off the devastating consequences of climate change that could result from warming of two degrees or more? Based on the initial round of commitments to reduce emissions that countries made as part of the Paris talks, the world is on a trajectory for a temperature increase of well over two degrees before the end of the century. The climate activist Bill McKibben, for his part, thinks the Paris pact, which he describes as \u201can ambitious agreement designed for about 1995,\u201d is likely arriving decades too late. \u201cTo meet that 1.5 degree target now would require breakneck action of a kind most nations aren\u2019t really contemplating,\u201d he wrote recently in The New York Times . \u201cAt this point we\u2019d need to leave almost all remaining coal and much of the oil and gas in the ground and put the world\u2019s industries to work on an emergency basis building solar panels and windmills.\u201d What John Ruskin noticed 144 years ago wasn\u2019t the climate-change phenomenon the world knows today, but his words were nevertheless a prophetic meditation on the urgency of investigating and remedying ruptures in the relationship between man and nature, before the compounding costs overwhelm man. This, in a way, was the task before negotiators in Paris, who have now attempted to lift the \u201cdry black veil\u201d of climate change. Whether they have succeeded won\u2019t be apparent for years.","headline":"How a Changing Climate Looked in the 19th Century","article_name":420453.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/12\/ruskin-paris-climate-change\/420453\/","date_published":"2015-12-16 12:00:00","article_length":8918,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:26.919189","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/12\/ruskin-paris-climate-change\/420453\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"With wheat prices surging as major producers are hit by droughts and other extreme weather events, it's costing everyone more to eat Writing on page one in the New York Times Justin Gillis recently sounded the alarm on what Lester Brown has been warning us for years: Climate change is threatening our food supply. With fuel prices down (not much) we'd like to think the economy will settle down. But volatility in markets, food baskets, and weather are rattling many. Indeed, food, feed, and fuel prices are contributing to the growing political instability across the globe. The summer heat engulfed towns felled by fiendish twisters. The Mighty Mississippi breached shores all along its course after being pounded by heavy rains and nourished by melting snow, the hangover from a brutal winter. The hundred-year floods inundated homes, homesteads, and farms, taking a toll on communities and commodities. The wide swings in weather were matched by major outlier events. All of us experienced the shifting weather patterns. This is the new norm. And as the climate changes, the extremes are proving especially costly for global food security. Grains are taking a particular beating. In the past year, wheat prices increased 75 percent. In 2009, the United Nations estimates, over one billion people were undernourished, and a greater toll is projected. Malnutrition -- accounting annually for 2.2 million under-five child deaths (and underlying much of childhood illness) -- is increasing, undermining health and well-being. The U.S. has had more than its share of bad weather (and it doesn't seem to let up). The record-breaking, tornado-packed storm system that hit a dozen states this past spring killed over 300. The southwest has been in drought and aquifers, already overdrawn and underfed, were further challenged by summer dry spells and heatwaves. In April, 83 wildfires consumed hundreds of square miles of Texas in one week. Extreme weather has reduced grain yields in the Southeast and in the Midwest Corn Belt. Globally, the trend is more pronounced. Climate change -- warming and altered weather patterns -- is contributing to production short-falls and rising grain prices. (Increasing demands for meat and dairy products, higher fuel prices, and displacement of food crops by biofuel-bound crops are compounding factors.) Warming, itself, is already damaging crops. Writing in Science magazine Stanford University's David Lobell and colleagues found that global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, from 1980 to 2008, due to rising global temperatures. Plants are, as we know, sensitive to warming and water stress, especially when hot days coincide with their reproductive stage (flowering). Warming is now costing consumers, agricultural companies, and livestock producers some $60 billion a year, the authors concluded. But that, unfortunately, is not the worst of it. Extreme weather events were not addressed in the recent study, and they are playing a rapidly escalating role. * * * Wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans provide the majority of calories for humans and animals, and wheat is the most widely traded grain on the international market. In 2008, 690 million tons of wheat were grown worldwide, with China, the E.U., India, the U.S., and Russia serving as the leading producers. But prices are rising and the consequences are proliferating. In 2008, prices jumped due to the economic collapse and the growth of biofuels, sparking food riots in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Egypt, Haiti, India, Somalia, and Yemen. This year, prices have jumped with each extreme weather event. In July and August of 2010, temperatures exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit in a Russian heatwave, far above normal. The extent surpassed that of the 2003 European summer heatwave, and over 50,000 excess deaths were attributed to both. The Russian heatwave and water stress inflamed wildfires that claimed close to 40 percent of the projected wheat crop. The government declared a state of emergency in 27 agricultural regions and wheat prices jumped 45 percent on global markets. The effects were immediate. Mozambique, one of the world's poorest nations, experienced riots in August due to higher bread (and fuel) prices. Thirteen people died -- and food subsidies were reinstated. Also in July and August of 2010, monster monsoons (an extreme version of a natural event) hit Pakistan. The floods displaced 20 million, killed close to 2,000, sickened thousands more, and inundated grain growing areas of the Indus. Climate models project additional intensification of Asian monsoons with continued warming. In November, 2010, an enormous tropical cyclone caused extensive flooding in Queensland, Australia, killing close to 2,000 (indigenous people being disproportionately affected), and costing an estimated $6 billion. Nearly three-quarters of Queensland, including several wheat-growing regions, was declared a disaster zone. Much of the young, winter wheat crop was severely damaged and grain exports were held up in the Brisbane, the state's largest grain terminal. Protracted drought in central China has cut winter and summer wheat production there, while reduced snowpack in China's Northern Plain has affected 15.8 million acres. Over one-third of China's wheat production has been lost this year. (Minimal rains in January provided some relief.) In June, also in China, historic flooding claimed more homes and farmland. Meanwhile, extreme cold compounded the drought's impact on wheat yields. China, with $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, can afford to import grains -- and it has recently begun to do so. But internal disparities have surfaced, even in China: In April, truck and taxi drivers protested rising food and fuel prices. Unfortunately there are biological consequences to altered weather patterns as well. From Morocco to Northern India, wetter winters have ushered in \"yellow rust\" fungus, destroying some 60 percent of the region's dry climate wheat. More pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides may be called up to control pests, pathogens, and weeds in a warmer world -- all with their own health consequences. * * * Suddenly, food security has reached critical proportions for many. With wheat prices surging 83 percent on the Chicago and Paris exchanges, nations where residents spend half of their income on food (Nigerians spend 73 percent and Vietnamese spend 65 percent) are undergoing mounting social strife. Price hikes and food insecurity are today contributing to political instability. In April, food riots broke out in Uganda and in Burkina Faso, and rising food, feed, and fuel price have helped catapult the cries for democracy in Northern Africa and the Middle East. While the fossil fuel industry continues its well-funded, well-orchestrated campaign to keep up a drum beat of doubt on climate change, the impacts are becoming self evident, and nowhere are they more pronounced than with the emergence of food insecurity. Addressing climate change is everyone's business. The challenges to inertia continue. In the U.S., a new group, Our Children's Trust, filed a suit in May against the U.S. government for its failure to protect the earth for generations unborn. (The brief was written by James Hansen of NASA and other scientists.) The U.K. has just announced accelerated targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions (50 percent by 2025), by reducing fossil fuel combustion and the felling of forests. There are many measures to help our agricultural systems adapt to the changing climate. But this is a critical time to scale up measures to clean up and transform our energy system, to give the climate a chance at restabilization. Image: REUTERS\/Andrew Caballero-Reynolds.

That despite nearly every other climate change metric \u2014\u00a0temperatures, sea levels, carbon dioxide concentration, and major storms \u2014\u00a0continuing to steadily increase. Gallup released the new data on Friday, noting that Americans show a \"low level\" of concern about climate change. Gallup's data comes four days after an exhaustive scientific analysis showing that concern about climate change and its effects is more than warranted, immediately. This is the key graph, and Gallup's description. That's pretty amazing. Particularly given what has happened with those other metrics: About a third of a degree higher annually. At least four centimeters higher . There have been\u00a0 131 billion-dollar plus \u00a0weather disasters in the US since 1989.\u00a0 (Data from the\u00a0 NCDC .)\u00a0 These disasters are not all related to climate change, but many \u2014 droughts, Hurricane Sandy \u2014 were made significantly\u00a0 worse .

Republicans are more like than not to worry about climate change not at all; Democrats, to worry about it a lot. That may in part be due to the traditional overlap of older Americans and Republican registration. Gallup wasn't able to provide me with a breakdown of party by age, but a report last month showed that older people were much less likely to think they'd see climate change in their lifetimes. And, while climate change is obviously already affecting the world around us, older people will certainly not experience the even-worse effects that are looming. Here's how worry compared to age in the new report: Is it possible, then, that as the Boomer population ages, belief among Americans will start to trend up? Maybe. Possibly. But since Americans have already managed to ignore the obvious patterns above, there's certainly reason to be skeptical. Particularly given the indifference to persuasion displayed by many of those who deny that climate change is happening.","headline":"Americans Don't Care About Climate Change Any More Than They Did in 1989","article_name":360215.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/04\/americans-dont-care-about-climate-change-any-more-than-they-did-in-1989\/360215\/","date_published":"2014-04-04 21:13:41","article_length":2338,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:28.564247","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/04\/americans-dont-care-about-climate-change-any-more-than-they-did-in-1989\/360215\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"For people living in Oceania, climate change is the fight of our lives, and we need more than science to win. We need stories. I know nothing of the night sky. This saddens but does not surprise Larry Raigetal, a master navigator who is chewing betel nut beneath a canopy of stars. He is from Lamotrek, an outer island of Yap, in the Federated States of Micronesia. But we are meeting in a canoe house on the neighboring island of Guam, where I call home. As we speak, Raigetal is using his hands to split the horizon into a 32-point star compass. He is drawing on centuries of knowledge to explain to me the art of wayfinding\u2014a method of non-instrument navigation that has been used by his people for thousands of years to voyage between the many atolls and islands of Micronesia. To my surprise, the compass he is conceptually grafting onto the sky is more than a map of stars as they rise and fall from east to west across the horizon. Wayfinding is a manner of organizing an elaborate body of directional information collected and committed to memory by countless navigators before him and passed down through chants to his grandfather, to his father, to him. It\u2019s a living repository of spectacularly specific details about sea swells, wind currents, reefs, shoals, and other seamarks\u2014including living ones. A pod of pilot whales. A shark with special markings. A seabird. As a Pacific Islander, I knew that the canoe house has long been a place of learning, and I\u2019d come to ask Raigetal about whether wayfinding had been compromised by climate change. As a human-rights lawyer working at the intersection of indigenous rights and environmental justice, I\u2019d also come because I believe that the peoples of the Pacific have important intellectual contributions to make to the global climate-justice movement. We have insights born not only of living in close harmony with the Earth but also of having survived so much already\u2014the ravages of extractive industry , the experiments of nuclear powers . We have information vital to the project of recovering the planet\u2019s life-support systems. Finally, I\u2019d come because my personal and professional reserves were depleted. Like so many others working in the climate space, I\u2019d been feeling overwhelmed since August, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released part of its sixth assessment report. The conclusions were bleak . Reading the report felt like being buried alive by an avalanche of facts\u2014the facts of sea-level rise and progressively severe storms, among others\u2014and I was looking to claw my way out. Read: It\u2019s grim As the darkness deepened around me and Raigetal, I realized two things. First, the climate-justice movement must listen more carefully to those most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change, such as Oceania\u2019s frontline communities. Second, we who are waist-deep in that movement need more than facts to win. We need stories. And not just stories about the stakes, which we know are high, but stories about the places we call home. Stories about our own small corners of the Earth as we know them. As we love them. In my corner, Micronesia, the facts are frightening. We are seeing a rate of sea-level rise two to three times the global average. Some scientists theorize that most of our low-lying coral-atoll nations may become uninhabitable as early as 2030. Faced with the prospect of climate-induced relocation , some leaders have contemplated buying land in other countries in anticipation of having to move some or all of their people. One leader has already sealed a deal. In 2014, the then-president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, entered into a purchase agreement with the Anglican Church for more than 5,000 acres in Fiji, paying nearly $9 million for them. (Kiribati has since begun using the land for farming .) Though the deal was seen as visionary by some, to others it marked a kind of death. After all, at what point does an agreement that envisions the relocation of an entire human population\u2014now some 121,000 people\u2014become more eulogy than contract? In Fiji, the government keeps its own kind of death list\u2014an official record of all the villages that may have to be relocated because of sea-level rise. Using internal climate-vulnerability assessments, the Fijian government has determined which of its coastal villages are most susceptible to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. As of 2017, 42 villages were on the list. If and when they are forced to move, they won\u2019t be the first: In 2014, Vunidogoloa formally relocated to higher ground, some two kilometers inland. When I spoke with Sailosi Ramatu, that village\u2019s headman, in July, he told me the move was hardest on the elders. In the months leading up to the relocation, they held prayer circles. They fasted. They readied themselves for the rupture of having to abandon their ancestral lands. In Fiji (as in many of our islands), the people are tethered to the earth, as enshrined in the concept of vanua, a word that means \u201cthe land\u201d and \u201cthe people\u201d at once. Vunidogoloans live and love and die on their lands, most of which they do not even own, at least not as individuals. Rather, theirs is a system of communal land ownership. They tend to their gardens. They bury their dead. They even bury their umbilical cords. So it was no surprise when, as about 30 families set out for the new site, some of the older women wailed as they walked. Perhaps that\u2019s a sound the sea makes when it rises: old women wailing. Not everyone made the journey; the dead remain interred in a cemetery at the old site. According to Ramatu, one of the biggest struggles his people faced was leaving their buried loved ones behind. Some worry they\u2019ll be cursed for abandoning their deceased relatives. Others walk around with holes in their heart. Like the old man who visits the cemetery nearly every day to sit by the grave of his dead wife. I\u2019m not sure which flowers he brings her, if any. But I imagine they\u2019re beautiful. Perhaps the story of climate change is a story of flowers. T hese are the facts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the country where the U.S. military houses its Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site: There, a crucial study on sea-level rise found that coral-atoll nations may not be able to sustain a human population past the present decade. This conclusion was met with trepidation by the Marshallese people I spoke with, who hear the ticking of the climate clock louder than most. The 2018 study, led by the United States Geological Survey and commissioned by the Pentagon, focused exclusively on an island in the Kwajalein atoll that supports some 1,250 American military personnel, contractors, and civilians living there and on nearby islands. For the most part, the U.S. otherwise ignores this region. Wake Island, where an additional study on sea-level rise is now being done, is proof of that fact. Wake, an island with no permanent inhabitants that the U.S. considers an unincorporated territory, is run by the Air Force under authority of a caretaker permit issued by the Interior Department. For its part, the RMI not only has a competing vision of what caretaking looks like; it also has a competing claim to Wake. In April 2016, the RMI formally claimed Wake Island when it filed its maritime coordinates with the United Nations secretary-general. The truth is that neither government is entirely correct. The strongest claim is that of the Marshallese people themselves, who say the island is theirs by way of history, culture, and birthright, and who long to be able to take proper care of it. They also say that Wake is not the island\u2019s true name. Its true name is Enen-Kio. The island of the orange flower. Famous in lore for the beauty of these flowers, Enen-Kio is also known for its rare assemblage of nesting seabirds\u2014frigates and albatross, among others. Legend has it that local warriors, seeking to prove their worthiness, would journey to the island in search of the wing bones of one such seabird. Fourteen years ago, on another starry night, a high chief explained to me that the retrieved bones were used as chisels in traditional tattoo ceremonies. I did not grasp the significance of the strip of orange splayed across the RMI flag until much later. Former President Hilda Heine would tell her poet daughter, Kathy, who would tell me: For the Marshallese, orange is the color of bravery. O n my island, climate change is a story of storms. Guam\u2014the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands and an unincorporated territory of the U.S.\u2014lies within one of the most active regions for tropical cyclones in the world. The typhoons that have historically battered the island are so strong, they\u2019re often called \u201csuper typhoons.\u201d Everyone here remembers their first. Mine was Omar, in August 1992. We were unprepared\u2014my mother, brother, sister, and me. This was in part because my father, who typically did the preparatory work of putting up shutters and removing debris from around the house, had recently died. I remember the four of us huddled behind a cream-colored mattress. I remember tracing its embroidered flowers with my finger. I remember everything, really. Trees and telephone poles cracked in half. The roof of our neighbor\u2019s house went flying, as did his canopy and one of his cars. I remember glass everywhere, as several windows and a sliding door shattered. I remember the sound of the wind as it blew under the bottom of my bedroom door. Like an old man sucking his teeth. Pamela is the one my mom remembers. May 1976. One of the most intense storms to strike Guam last century, Pamela generated eight-meter waves and ravaged the beaches on both the northern and eastern sides of the island. She sank 10 ships in the local harbor. She did an estimated $500 million worth of damage. But none of this is what my mom remembers. What she remembers, what she will never forget, is a single white toilet. American Standard. The one thing left of her house when Pamela was over. Then there was Paka. December 1997. The wind and rain beat down on us for 12 hours. The barometric pressure was so low that it was believed to have induced labor in nine pregnant women. Paka, like Russ in 1990 and Yuri in 1991, unearthed untold numbers of dead bodies when it slammed into the southern cemeteries of Yona and Inarajan. Corpses spilled out of their coffins. Coffins bobbed like buoys in the bay. Read: The media barely covered one of the worst storms to hit U.S. soil Several families spent weeks combing the beaches in search of their loved ones. Some were never found. My aunt, who worked for one of the cemeteries, said that one family was able to identify their father\u2019s body only because of a cherished baseball cap, which they had buried him in and which had stuck to his skull by way of a mess of seaweed. Suffice it to say, when the IPCC dropped its latest report, confirming that tropical cyclones are just going to get stronger, my corner of the world shuddered. After all, although 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming will make these storms even more severe, that same severity will increase dramatically with 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 3. I can\u2019t begin to imagine what any of this will mean on the ground\u2014and not just for Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands, but for Vanuatu, Fiji, and Solomon Islands, whose communities already seem to be lurching from one Category 5 cyclone to another. T hroughout Oceania, the story of climate change is also a story of ingenuity. In the Carteret Islands\u2014off the coast of Bougainville, in Papua New Guinea\u2014the women are taking matters into their own hands. Frustrated by how slowly the Papua New Guinean government was implementing its relocation plans, they sought to mobilize the community around the issue of relocation. They formed an organization and named it Tulele Peisa, which means \u201csailing the waves on our own\u201d in the local Halia language. To date, Tulele Peisa has organized several community consultations as well as visiting missions between the Carteret Islanders and potential host communities in nearby Bougainville. According to Ursula Rakova, the group\u2019s leader, Tulele Peisa has also secured several tracts of arable land on which it is now growing gardens of taro and cassava. She told me the group has planted more than 30,000 cocoa trees and even established a cocoa-bean refinery. All told, Tulele Peisa has developed an 18-point relocation plan for its community. Rakova said other coastal communities have followed suit and are currently formulating their own relocation plans. So it would seem that the Pacific Climate Warriors were right. The youth-led group fighting climate change across Oceania, as part of the global 350.org network, famously declared: We\u2019re not drowning. We\u2019re fighting. And we are. The Marshall Islands has spearheaded the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries that works to amplify voices that have long been marginalized in the climate realm. Fiji, too, has taken a leadership role, presiding over the Conference of the Parties for the 23rd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and spearheading the so-called talanoa dialogues\u2014sessions that use storytelling to foster more empathetic decision making. One could argue that Fiji is also leading the way on the complex issue of climate-induced relocation. Consider the list of 42 villages slated for possible relocation. However heartrending, the very existence of the list is a testament to Fiji\u2019s efforts. Conversations about relocation are enormously difficult to have, but that country is having them. Photos: A visit to Tuvalu, surrounded by the rising Pacific Tuvalu , Tokelau, Kiribati, and the Marshall Islands have joined forces with the Maldives to form a coalition of coral-atoll nations to advocate for the financial resources necessary to adapt to climate change. To date, what money most of them have been able to secure has been limited to funding the first-generation stuff of seawalls and early-warning systems\u2014nowhere near the level they will need to actually adapt, let alone adapt in place. But they press on, planting mangroves and plugging away at their national plans. A group of law students from the University of the South Pacific led a different charge in Vanuatu: They advocated that that climate-vulnerable country take the lead in pursuing an advisory opinion on climate change from the International Court of Justice. As these students see it, the lack of clarity around state duties is impairing the collective efforts of the international community to respond effectively to the climate crisis. In September, the students succeeded in their initial goal, and Vanuatu announced that it would spearhead the initiative. (I should note here that I am leading the global team assisting Vanuatu in this effort.) In the Marianas, many indigenous Chamorros and Carolinians of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are fighting the destruction of our lands and seas by the single largest institutional producer of greenhouse gases in the world: the U.S. military . On land, these activists are opposing the construction of a massive firing range, which they say will destroy a limestone forest and imperil a whole host of nonhuman life. At sea, they\u2019re challenging the Defense Department\u2019s attempt to militarize a section of the ocean almost the size of India. All this to say, if my corner of the Earth had an anthem, it\u2019d be this: To hell with drowning. That anthem was never more clearly on display than during the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts, held in the summer of 2016, when the Lucky Star arrived at the local harbor. Lucky Star was one of three canoes sailed to Guam from Lamotrek by the wayfinder Raigetal and his crew of apprentices. What made this particular canoe so special was the fact that its sail was traditional, meaning it was woven from pandanus leaves by the women of Lamotrek. There, in the weeks leading up to the voyage, it was discovered that the knowledge of how to weave such a sail was very nearly lost. Literally one woman still knew how to do it. Her name was Maria Labushoilam, a 90-year-old master weaver, and she was dying. Maria would spend the last two weeks of her life teaching 15 women how to make that sail. From her deathbed, she taught them how to harvest, dry, and split the leaves, and then how to weave them. After she died, the women completed the sail without her. The community raised it together. The Lamotrekese are emblematic of the predicament all Oceanic peoples are facing today: We come from cultural traditions rich in beauty and resilience\u2014the same traditions that have enabled us to thrive in our ancestral spaces for thousands of years\u2014but that is simply not enough to ensure our continued survival. The part simply cannot save the whole. The answer to the question of climate change must come from everyone, or it will come from no one. You could say Maria performed something of a miracle in her final days. With nothing more than pandanus leaves and love, she opened a window to a world\u2014a future in which good people refuse to simply lie down and die, a future rooted in respect for possibility, a future with room for us all. May we have the courage to climb through it.","headline":"To Hell With Drowning","article_name":620570.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2021\/11\/oceania-pacific-climate-change-stories\/620570\/","date_published":"2021-11-01 10:00:00","article_length":17303,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:29.267729","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2021\/11\/oceania-pacific-climate-change-stories\/620570\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A United Nations climate panel has released its latest report on the state of our planet, and is now ready to\u00a0 declare it a virtual certainty \u00a0that human activity has led to a rise in global temperatures.\u00a0 A United Nations climate panel has released its latest report on the state of our planet, and is now ready to declare it a virtual certainty that human activity has led to a rise in global temperatures. The report, which is released every six years by\u00a0the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is an attempt to compile and synthesize all the relevant research being done in climate science into one comprehensive document. It contains the work over 800 contributing authors and 50 editors from 39 different countries, and the level of agreement among their work is overwhelming. The bottom line finding in the report is that global temperatures are on the rise over the last century (an indisputable fact) and that \"anthropogenic\" [caused by human activity] factors are to blame: It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface\u00a0temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas\u00a0concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. The report also explains that \"extremely likely,\" in this case, means a 95-to-100 percent confidence level, which in scientific terms is pretty much a lock . That's also a substantial increase over the same report from 12 years ago, which expressed only a 66-percent confidence level of the same finding. They also said (with slightly less confidence, but still classified as \"likely\") that \"1983\u20132012 was\u00a0likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years.\" Scientists and activists are putting emphasis not just on the conclusions of the report, but on the overwhelming support that those conclusions have in the scientific community. In addition to listing the huge numbers of researchers who contributed to the data, 50 international editors spent months crafting the language of the report to avoid any misunderstandings or misinterpretations. The panel spent the last week in closed door meetings in Stockholm, polishing the final draft. The activist group Avaaz came out to demonstrate the support being given to report by building this giant unbalanced see-saw, showing all the climate scientists one one end. Despite the dire warnings, there are some scientists who say the panel didn't go far enough. The New York Times quotes one researcher who believes the panel is too conservative in its estimates of future increases in temperatures and ocean levels. Meanwhile, that five-percent window is enough for climate change denialists to fight back, which they are already doing. The report does say that it's not too late to undo some of the damage , but the world is not moving in the right direction. In order to keep warming below the target level of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, humans would have limit the total amount of carbon burned into the atmosphere to one trillion tons. The world has already burned half a trillion tons since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and at its current pace, will reach one trillion in the year 2040. The full report will be released on Monday morning, but you can read the detailed summary at the IPCC website.","headline":"Scientists Are 95% Certain Humans Are Responsible for Climate Change","article_name":310563.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/09\/scientists-are-95-certain-humans-are-repsonsible-climate-change\/310563\/","date_published":"2013-09-27 11:41:42","article_length":3417,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:30.045941","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/09\/scientists-are-95-certain-humans-are-repsonsible-climate-change\/310563\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Thirteen federal agencies agree: Climate change has already wreaked havoc on the United States, and the worst is likely yet to come. On Friday afternoon, the U.S. government published a major and ominous climate report. Despite being released on a holiday, when it seemed the smallest number of people would be paying attention , the latest installment of the National Climate Assessment is, as told to my colleague Robinson Meyer, full of \u201cinformation that every human needs.\u201d Read: A grave climate warning, buried on Black Friday The report traces the effects climate change has already wrought upon every region of the United States, from nationwide heat waves to dwindling snowpacks in the West. In blunt and disturbing terms, it also envisions the devastation yet to come. The document\u2019s dire claims, backed by 13 federal agencies, come frequently into conflict with the aims of the administration that released it. Where the Trump administration has sought to loosen restrictions  on car emissions , the report warns that vehicles are contributing to unhealthy ozone levels that affect nearly a third of Americans. Whereas the president has ensured that the United States will no longer meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement on climate change , the report says that ignoring Paris could accelerate coral bleaching in Hawaii by more than a decade. Here are the report\u2019s three most chilling conclusions: 1. Extreme hot weather is getting more common, and cold weather more rare. In its first chapter, the National Climate Assessment reports that heat-wave season has expanded by more than 40 days since the 1960s. In the bleakest scenario of unchecked climate change, Phoenix could have as many as 150 days per year above 100 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Over the past two decades, the number of high temperature records recorded in the United States far exceeds the number of low temperature records. The length of the frost-free season, from the last freeze in spring to the first freeze of autumn, has increased for all regions since the early 1900s. The frequency of cold waves has decreased since the early 1900s, and the frequency of heat waves has increased since the mid-1960s. Over timescales shorter than a decade, the 1930s Dust Bowl remains the peak period for extreme heat in the United States for a variety of reasons, including exceptionally dry springs coupled with poor land management practices during that era. Over the next few decades, annual average temperature over the contiguous United States is projected to increase by about 2.2\u00b0F (1.2\u00b0C) relative to 1986\u20132015, regardless of future scenario. As a result, recent record-setting hot years are projected to become common in the near future for the United States. Much larger increases are projected by late century: 2.3\u00b0\u20136.7\u00b0F (1.3\u00b0\u20133.7\u00b0C) under a lower scenario \u2026 and 5.4\u00b0\u201311.0\u00b0F (3.0\u00b0\u20136.1\u00b0C) under a higher scenario \u2026 relative to 1986\u20132015. Extreme high temperatures are projected to increase even more than average temperatures. Cold waves are projected to become less intense and heat waves more intense. The number of days below freezing is projected to decline, while the number of days above 90\u00b0F is projected to rise. 2. Climate change has doubled the devastation from wildfires in the Southwest. According to the report, human-caused climate change has heated and dried out the American Southwest, leading to deaths, enormous costs, and lingering health consequences. Climate change has led to an increase in the area burned by wildfire in the western United States. Analyses estimate that the area burned by wildfire from 1984 to 2015 was twice what would have burned had climate change not occurred. Furthermore, the area burned from 1916 to 2003 was more closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors. Climate change has driven the wildfire increase, particularly by drying forests and making them more susceptible to burning. Specifically, increased temperatures have intensified drought in California, contributed to drought in the Colorado River Basin, reduced snowpack, and caused spring-like temperatures to occur earlier in the year. In addition, historical fire suppression policies have caused unnatural accumulations of understory trees and coarse woody debris in many lower-elevation forest types, fueling more intense and extensive wildfires. Wildfire can threaten people and homes, particularly as building expands in fire-prone areas. Wildfires around Los Angeles from 1990 to 2009 caused $3.1 billion in damages (unadjusted for inflation). Respiratory illnesses and life disruptions from the Station Fire north of Los Angeles in 2009 cost an estimated $84 per person per day (in 2009 dollars). In addition, wildfires degraded drinking water upstream of Albuquerque with sediment, acidity, and nitrates and in Fort Collins, Colorado, with sediment and precursors of cancer-causing trihalomethane, necessitating a multi-month switch to alternative municipal water supplies. 3. Rising sea levels will necessitate mass migrations, and coastal cities aren\u2019t doing enough. The report\u2019s chapter on the coastal effects of climate change warns that sea-level rise alone could force tens of millions of people to move from their homes within the next century. Shoreline counties hold 49.4 million housing units, while homes and businesses worth at least $1.4 trillion sit within about 1\/8th mile of the coast. Flooding from rising sea levels and storms is likely to destroy, or make unsuitable for use, billions of dollars of property by the middle of this century, with the Atlantic and Gulf coasts facing greater-than-average risk compared to other regions of the country \u2026 Climate change impacts are expected to drive human migration from coastal locations, but exactly how remains uncertain. As demonstrated by the migration of affected individuals in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, impacts from storms can disperse refugees from coastal areas to all 50 states, with economic and social costs felt across the country. Sea level rise might reshape the U.S. population distribution, with 13.1 million people potentially at risk of needing to migrate due to a [sea-level rise] of 6 feet \u2026 by the year 2100. The Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe on Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was awarded $48 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement a resettlement plan. The tribe is one of the few communities to qualify for federal funding to move en masse \u2026 It remains difficult \u2026 to tally the extent of adaptation implementation in the United States because there are no common reporting systems, and many actions that reduce climate risk are not labeled as climate adaptation. Enough is known, however, to conclude that adaptation implementation is not uniform nor yet common across the United States \u2026 The scale of adaptation implementation for some effects and locations seems incommensurate with the projected scale of climate threats.

{"id":null,"body":"Cities simply don\u2019t have enough time to run from a storm like Ida. Seventy-four hours. That\u2019s roughly how much time separated the moment that Tropical Depression Nine formed in the Caribbean from the moment that the storm, transformed into a ruthless Category 4 hurricane named Ida, made landfall at Port Fourchon , Louisiana. Even less time\u2014perhaps 60 hours\u2014separated the storm\u2019s promotion to hurricane strength and the first arrival of tropical-storm winds in Louisiana, the latter of which marks the moment that any official evacuation must be nearly complete. That\u2019s when drivers need to start getting off the roads, and when local services are shut down until the storm passes. It wasn\u2019t enough time. While Ida was a well-predicted storm, 60 hours of warning was too short for New Orleans officials to issue a mandatory evacuation order in the days before it landed. The limits of the city\u2019s highways mean that the city must issue an evacuation order at least 72 hours before tropical-storm winds hit land. Officials said last year that the coronavirus pandemic means they may need 82 hours of warning, to account for the increased difficulty of moving and sheltering people. With wind speeds of 150 miles an hour at the moment of landfall, Ida\u2014which eventually weakened to a Category 3 storm this evening\u2014is provisionally tied for first as the strongest hurricane ever to hit Louisiana . While the extent of damage in the most affected cities is still unclear, the storm has caused catastrophic power loss in New Orleans and forced doctors and nurses in at least one hospital to pump air into COVID-19 patients\u2019 lungs by hand. It has destroyed at least one historic jazz site and knocked out 95 percent of U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. It also illustrates how climate change is making it even harder for cities in the path of major storms to govern effectively. Climate change has a subtle influence on hurricanes: They seem to be getting wetter and more intense, but not necessarily more frequent. Scientists are confident that global warming is increasing rainfall from major tropical cyclones, just as it is increasing precipitation amounts from all types of storms. Scientists have observed that tropical cyclones are generally getting stronger worldwide as well. A growing share of hurricanes are Category 3 or greater, according to the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . But some researchers also believe that more hurricanes are following the pattern taken by Ida and getting significantly stronger in the hours before landfall. The strongest storms, in fact, might only come about through rapid intensification. As Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami, has noted, all four recorded Category 5 storms to make landfall in the continental United States had been tropical storms just 72 hours earlier . In the past few years, several prominent hurricanes have seemed to undergo this rapid intensification. Hurricane Michael, which carved a devastating path through the Florida Panhandle as a Category 5 storm in 2018, had been a relatively weak hurricane only two days prior to landfall. Hurricane Harvey, which deluged Houston in 2017, also intensified up to the moment that it came ashore. Kerry Emanuel, a meteorology professor at MIT who is one of the most prominent scholars of hurricanes and climate change, has warned that rapid intensification poses a significant risk to accurate hurricane forecasting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more cases of rapid intensification [in a warmed climate], and that includes the accident of it rapidly intensifying just before it makes landfall,\u201d Emanuel told me in 2017. If rapid intensification becomes more common, as Emanuel fears, then officials will find it harder to make good judgments about hurricanes. Over the past few decades, meteorologists have gotten significantly better at predicting where a storm might go, but they still don\u2019t always know how strong it will be when it gets there. That\u2019s a problem, because decision makers need to know both track and intensity to make good calls: Knowing a storm will pass overhead in three days is meaningless if you don\u2019t know whether it will be Category 1 or Category 5 when it arrives. If major hurricanes can form in less than 72 hours, but local governments need more than 72 hours to prepare and evacuate, then we\u2019re running up against the physical limits of hurricane preparedness. As Kelly Hereid, a climate scientist at Liberty Mutual, recently tweeted : \u201cIt takes longer to evacuate a city than it takes to build a destructive hurricane.\u201d Politicians could try to cope with rapid intensification by ordering evacuations even before a storm was certain to strike their city, but a needless evacuation can be costly. In 2005, nearly as many Houstonians died fleeing Hurricane Rita in cars as died in the storm itself. The answer, Hereid has proposed, may be to build better hurricane-safe shelters in cities so that people don\u2019t have to leave a city for protection from a storm. For now, though, Americans are stuck with the evacuation plans and physical infrastructure that they already have: roadways and cities built for the wrong century, built for a kinder climate.","headline":"We\u2019re Hitting the Limits of Hurricane Preparedness","article_name":619926.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/08\/hurricane-ida-end-of-hurricane-preparedness\/619926\/","date_published":"2021-08-30 02:56:00","article_length":5254,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:31.244684","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/08\/hurricane-ida-end-of-hurricane-preparedness\/619926\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The White House will be going hard on climate change all week, thanks to a new National Climate Assessment report looking at what climate change means for the U.S., short and long-term.\u00a0 The White House will be going hard on climate change all week, thanks to a new National Climate Assessment report looking at what climate change means for the U.S., short and long-term. And surprise: researchers had no trouble documenting the already present effects of rising global temperatures on the country, region by region. In a sense, the findings of the government's report aren't news, thanks to several studies documenting changes in, for example \"extreme precip itation, \" over time. We've even had climate change maps of the U.S. before. But this report is why you'll see President Obama\u00a0 giving interviews to meteorologists on the local news tonight . Climate change is a global issue, but recent reports, including this one, have tried to emphasize just how local and observable it is. Here's a key paragraph from the report:\u00a0 \u201cAmericans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods.\u201d All that with a rise of just 2 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit\u00a0in global temperatures. According to the report, the Northeast has been blessed with the greatest increase in extreme precipitation, compared to every other part of the country. From 1958 to 2010, that's a 70 percent increase in \"the amount of\u00a0precipitation\u00a0falling in very heavy events.\" That increased rain and snow, along with rising sea levels on the Northeast coast, will translate into more flooding across the region. New Englanders don't need to be told that the infrastructure in the area is on the older side, or that the increased flooding that's happening already has challenged that infrastructure. There's another major effect the Northeast is already feeling: increased heat waves. And that's going to get worse, no matter what we do. Look at the map above, provided by the study. As you can see, climate change is threatening to burn up Maryland with dramatically more days over 90 degrees per year. Compared to that number at the end of the 20th century, the southern Northeast could be looking at more than 60 additional days a year of heat-wave level temperatures, the study notes. New York City doesn't look that cool either. The map presents two scenarios, \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\" projections for the number of likely 90 and above days in the years\u00a02041 to 2070. If we dramatically cut emissions, we're still looking at a lot more hot days in the summer. If we do nothing, it'll be even worse. As is true in many regions, the changes in climate will negatively impact the region's farming, and fishing industries, and its ecosystems. The report's authors are sure of one thing for this region: it will see a dramatic increase in the number of extra-hot days per year, with the intensity of that change depending on whether we reduce emissions or not. However, the science is less clear on what climate change will bring for the region precipitation-wise, in part because the Southeast seems to straddle the border between two different scenarios: Because the Southeast is located in the transition zone between projected wetter conditions to the north and drier conditions to the southwest, many of the model projections show only small changes relative to natural variations. However, many models do project drier conditions in the far southwest of the region and wetter conditions in the far northeast of the region, consistent with the larger continental-scale pattern of wetness and dryness.\u00a0 There is mounting evidence that the combination\u00a0of human-caused temperature increases and recent drought\u00a0has influenced widespread tree mortality, increased fire\u00a0occurrence and area burned,\u00a0and forest insect outbreaks.\u00a0Human-caused temperature increases and\u00a0drought have also caused earlier spring snowmelt and shifted\u00a0runoff to earlier in the year. While increased area burned can\u00a0be statistically estimated from climate projections, changes\u00a0in the risk of very large, high-intensity, stand-replacing fires\u00a0cannot yet be predicted, but such events could have enormous\u00a0impacts for forest-dependent species. Increased wildfire\u00a0could exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses in\u00a0nearby populations due to smoke and particulate pollution","headline":"How Climate Change Will Affect Where You Live","article_name":361792.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/05\/how-climate-change-will-affect-where-you-live\/361792\/","date_published":"2014-05-06 17:41:56","article_length":4707,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:31.833272","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/05\/how-climate-change-will-affect-where-you-live\/361792\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Nations like China and India remain committed to the Paris climate change agreement\u2014with or without the U.S. The Trump administration\u2019s reported announcement that it is withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement has prompted nations and world leaders to reiterate their commitment to the global pact. Signed in 2015 during the Obama administration, the Paris Agreement is an unprecedented global climate deal that aims to contain greenhouse gas emissions and protect the world against global warming. Only two countries\u2014Nicaragua and Syria\u2014declined to sign the agreement in 2015. At the G7 Summit last week in Italy, many world leaders encouraged President Trump to remain a member of the pact, with foreign diplomats reportedly holding conversations with members of the Trump administration in hopes of getting the president to change his mind. On Wednesday morning, the United Nations reiterated this plea, tweeting a quote from its Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: \u201cClimate action is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.\u201d Even Pope Francis hinted at his desire for the U.S. to remain part of the agreement when he handed Trump a signed copy of his work chronicling the need to combat human-driven climate change during Trump\u2019s visit to the Vatican. On Wednesday morning, White House officials confirmed that Trump planned to leave the Paris Agreement, though some still argue a decision has yet to be made. Trump\u2019s staff was reportedly divided on the matter, with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggesting he stay, while EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, chief strategist Steve Bannon, and White House counsel Don McGahn pushed for an exit. Last week, 22 U.S. senators also wrote a letter to Trump encouraging the president to withdraw from the pact, arguing that it could legally prevent him from rescinding the Clean Power Plan\u2014another Obama-era global warming initiative. Late Wednesday evening, Trump tweeted that he would announce his decision Thursday at 3:00 p.m. at the White House Rose Garden. Trump previously stated on the campaign trail that he would exit the Paris Agreement. In the past, he has referred to global warming as a \u201choax.\u201d According to Axios , which was first to report the news that Trump is planning to withdraw, the administration is debating whether to formally exit the pact\u2014a process that could take several years\u2014or simply leave the UN climate change treaty that negotiated the Paris Agreement\u2014a speedier, but more controversial, process. Regardless of whether Trump stays, most foreign governments are committed to honoring the pact. In March, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said that all members of the Paris Agreement should \u201cfulfill their commitments,\u201d adding that China would do the same \u201cregardless of how other countries\u2019 climate policies change.\u201d Two months later, the ministry said that Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with the president of France , Emmanuel Macron, about how the nations \u201cshould protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement.\u201d With the U.S. likely to leave the pact, China aims to be the world\u2019s foremost leader on combatting climate change. According to the EU\u2019s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the EU and China have formed a new alliance in response to Trump\u2019s impending decision. The nations \u201care joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy,\u201d Ca\u00f1ete told  The Guardian on Wednesday. As part of their joint efforts, China and the EU have expressed their \u201chighest political commitment\u201d to the agreement, and are encouraging all signatories to do the same. \u201cFor Europe there is no plan B, because we do not have a plan B,\u201d Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the vice president of the EU\u2019s Energy Union, told reporters last week. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, had harsher words to share on Wednesday, informing members at a student conference that \u201cEurope\u2019s duty is to say \u2026 The Americans can\u2019t just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn\u2019t know the details.\u201d Juncker added that European leaders tried to explain the ramifications of leaving the agreement to Trump, but couldn\u2019t get through to the president. \u201cNot everything in international agreements is fake news,\u201d Juncker said. While India was reluctant to join the Paris Agreement in 2015, the nation has also reiterated its commitment to the pact. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, met with the prime minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, on Wednesday, where both countries said they would remain signatories. Canada\u2019s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, has also confirmed the nation is committed to the agreement. \u201cCanada is going to show leadership with China and the EU and we certainly hope the U.S. will be joining us,\u201d McKenna said recently . As late as Wednesday, Peter Altmaier, the chief of staff for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, remained optimistic that Trump could be convinced to stay. \u201cAs far as I can see, it is an ongoing debate within the administration,\u201d Altmaier said. While Trump\u2019s decision may not affect whether nations choose to remain in the Paris Agreement, it could affect whether signatories are held accountable. In the absence of U.S. oversight, nations may be less inclined to transparently report their greenhouse gas emissions. Other experts argue that Trump\u2019s decision could weaken the authority of the U.S. on the global stage. \u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, it\u2019s a colossal mistake\u2014an abdication of American leadership,\u201d Nicholas Burns, a senior official for the Bush administration, told  The New York Times . \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more destructive to our credibility than this.\u201d","headline":"The Global Reaction to Trump's Climate-Change Decision","article_name":528777.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/news\/archive\/2017\/06\/the-global-reaction-to-trumps-climate-change-decision\/528777\/","date_published":"2017-06-01 05:31:25","article_length":5865,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:32.228283","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/news\/archive\/2017\/06\/the-global-reaction-to-trumps-climate-change-decision\/528777\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Welcome to the Great Green North. While delegates to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw continued fiddling while Rome burns, the government of Ontario, Canada, today moved to permanently ban coal-fired power plants . \u201cOur work on eliminating coal and investing in renewables is the strongest action being taken in North America to fight climate change,\u201d Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, said in a statement. Wynne\u2019s government next week will introduce the Ending Coal for Cleaner Air Act in Parliament. Unlike most such legislation, the Act will ratify what the government has already done \u2013 close down the coal-fired power plants that once supplied a quarter of the province\u2019s electricity. Today, Wynne, and a visiting Al Gore, announced the shuttering of two huge coal power plants ahead of schedule, which will save $95 million in operating costs, according to the government. Once a third big coal-fired plant switches to burning biomass over the next year, the legislation would ensure that no new coal power stations get built. The Ontario government estimates that burning coal results in more than $4 billion in annual health and environmental costs. Ontario\u2019s coal ban comes as new data shows that greenhouse gas emissions reached a record in 2012 and have risen 58% since 1990. That\u2019s despite two decades of UN climate negotiations that were supposed to result in a 5% reduction in the world\u2019s carbon spew below 1990 levels by last year. It\u2019s just another sign that any progress in combating catastrophic climate change is happening on the regional level.\u00a0 Quebec, for instance, last month signed an agreement with California to link their carbon trading markets .\u00a0 And California, which has prohibited its big utilities from signing new contracts to import coal-fired electricity from out of state, also reached an accord last month with British Columbia, Oregon and Washington State \u2013 Ecotopia! \u2013\u00a0 to develop common mandates for cutting carbon emissions and promoting clean technologies like electric cars . According to data released this week by the Global Carbon Project, a non-profit research institute, burning coal accounts for 42% of worldwide carbon emissions. Canada is the planet\u2019s 17 th largest emitter of coal-related greenhouse gas emissions, spewing 76 million metric tons (MtCO2) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2012. (The United States, in contrast, emitted 1626 MtC02 while China\u2019s emissions hit 6990 MtCO2.) Coal supplied 7,500 megawatts of electricity to Ontario. To replace all that dirty power, the province has been on a green-energy building spree, installing and commissioning 7,100 megawatts of carbon-free electricity, mainly from solar and wind farms.","headline":"As UN Climate Change Talks Go Nowhere, Ontario Bans Coal","article_name":281738.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/11\/as-un-climate-change-talks-go-nowhere-ontario-bans-coal\/281738\/","date_published":"2013-11-21 21:07:33","article_length":2726,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:33.264356","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/11\/as-un-climate-change-talks-go-nowhere-ontario-bans-coal\/281738\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A guide to the most contentious issues and how they\u2019re discussed in the agreement Climate change is a slow story. The permafrost thaws. The oceans acidify. The cost of solar power falls. And meanwhile humanity keeps adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The climate worsens slowly, and it will be solved slowly. Its works in time scales years and decades-long, not days or hours. Yet every so often there is an exceptional moment, and we are in one right now. This may be the single most important week for the climate this decade. That\u2019s because right now, in a suburb of Paris, global negotiators are in all-day, all-night talks to try and advance the first major global climate agreement since the 1990s. So far, these highly anticipated talks have gone much better than expected . They have avoided the acrimony and impassable \u201cred lines\u201d of previous conventions. But that\u2019s partly because all the easy problems have been solved. Now only the hard questions remain. Here\u2019s a guide to most of them. How much should the world limit warming? The background: In 2009, the world\u2019s nations agreed : The global temperature average should not be allowed to rise more than two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. Since then, study after study has emphasized the dangers of a two-degree-warmed world and the simultaneous difficulty of actually halting climate change there . When Paris began, some observers expected the UN to abandon the two-degree limit in favor of something more realistic. Instead, there are some signs it may embrace a more ambitious target. More than 100 countries, including the United States, have announced support for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Many island nations have declared they cannot accept anything more. China has also signaled its endorsement. Were the UN to follow their lead, it would be a triumph for both activists and the most climate-vulnerable nations\u2014 even though many scientists , including President Obama\u2019s top science advisor , believe keeping warming below 1.5 degrees to be a near impossibility. The text: In the December 9 version of the draft Paris outcome, Article 2, Section 1 deals most directly with temperature limits: How quickly will the world abandon fossil fuels? The background: If humanity hopes to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, it must essentially stop emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2060, according to a recent study from Nature Climate Change . (Then it must start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere\u2014 no easy feat .) But should the Paris agreement come out and say that? Delegates are less sure. Small island states want forceful language, like the phrases above which call for \u201czero global [greenhouse-gas] emissions by 2060\u201d or \u201cdecarbonization as soon as possible after mid-century.\u201d But Saudi Arabia says that such a goal is a \u201c threat to sustainable development \u201d\u2014 which some interpret as meaning a threat to its oil production. (The head of the Saudi climate delegation also advises the country\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum .) According to The New York Times , petroleum-pumping Venezuela is also skeptical of long-term decarbonization language. The text: In the December 9 version of the draft Paris outcome, Article 3, Section 1 addresses the conference\u2019s collective long-term goal: Who should pay for the costs of climate change, and how much should they give? The background: Surprise, surprise: \u201cClimate finance\u201d\u2014that is, who gets money, and who gives it\u2014is the most controversial issue at the Paris talks. In order to salvage the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, Hillary Clinton pledged that the rich world would \u201cmobilize\u201d $100 billion to help developing countries make their economies more sustainable and prepare for the storms to come. The key word is mobilize: Unlike traditional foreign aid, where government money is redirected to poorer countries, the U.S. and the E.U. would arrange for billions to flow from a variety of sources, public and private. Does that count? And is the rich world defined strictly as the U.S., E.U., Canada, and Japan ? The United States would prefer for China and India\u2014two wealthy, powerful nations that also contain hundreds of millions of people still in poverty\u2014to pitch into that $100 billion target. Yet even as the two talk up their own investment in the developing world at the talks, they blanche at being compelled to join the rich world\u2019s pledge . The text: A great deal of the December 9 version of the draft Paris outcome deals with money, but here\u2019s a taste, from Article 6, section 2 : How often should nations check and reassess their emission reductions? The background: Two different mechanisms apply here. The first is stock-taking , when countries will announced how they\u2019ve reduced carbon emissions. The draft Paris agreement now says global stock-takes will take place every five years. It also says that the first stocktake will happen in either 2023 or 2024, though the United States wants them to start earlier. The New York  Times  reports that the U.S. is angling for the first stock-take to come in 2019 or 2021\u2014both non-presidential election years. The second is ratcheting , when countries will announce more ambitious emissions reductions. India hopes for ratchet sessions to come every 10 years, saying its short term goal must be lifting its people out of poverty. The U.S. and the Pacific island nations wants countries to ratchet every five years. The text: Article 10 of the the December 9 draft Paris outcome deals with global stocktaking, as do a few other sections: Who should make sure nations meet their reduction goals? The background: The United States wants an outside agency, perhaps similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency, to make sure nations keep the promises they made before the Paris talks to cut emissions . China, India, and other developing countries are skeptical of third-party oversight. In the Times , a former Clinton climate advisor says that the U.S. has increased its climate-finance money to try and gain leverage on the issue, but that the two rapidly developing powers are happy to wait the talks out. The text: Right now, mention of an outside agency does not appear in the Paris draft text. Who is responsible for the loss and damage caused by climate change? The background: As climate change worsens, it will assault not only coastal cities and settlements, but also rural farmers and fishers who depend on predictable seasons and reliable ocean currents. Who should pay for all the infrastructure deluged and harvests lost? In 2013, a UN climate conference began establishing an international loss and damage mechanism to address these concerns. The United States and other developed countries\u2014which, after all, have emitted most of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere right now and thus are responsible for that warming\u2014say they want to help. But they cannot abide what would amount to climate reparations. \u201cThe U.S. clearly acknowledges that these impacts are being felt, but it does have a red line around increases of compensation and liability,\u201d says Rachel Cleetus, the lead economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The text: In the December 9 draft of the Paris outcome , a standalone Article 5 addresses loss and damage: Who bears responsibility for protecting the climate, anyway? The background: In 1992, the world adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . This document has guided all future climate diplomacy: This climate convention in Paris formally meets under its auspices. The framework convention establishes the principle of \u201c c ommon but differentiated responsibility \u201d for protecting the climate system: That is, everyone has a role to play in keeping the world safe, but highly developed countries have the most responsibility. Now, many developed countries want to make sure this principle is adhered to: the differentiated as much as the common. There\u2019s no single blurb of text to point to that demonstrates this principle, said Cleetus, but developing countries want it to be a common thread through the text. \u201cMitigation commitments, finance commitments\u2014developing countries were asking for these issues to be seen together,\u201d she told me. They needed \u201cto be decided together under the convention rather than as one-off agreements on specific pieces of it.\u201d In particular, she said, they want any ratchet mechanism for emissions reduction to be tied to increases in finance from developed countries. Developing countries \u201cwon\u2019t agree on an outcome where they\u2019re making agreements to emissions reductions and are not seeing commensurate increases in finance,\u201d Cleetus said. The text: Again, no single portion of the December 9 Paris draft outcome addresses these issues. But I was struck by these two adjoining resolutions in the preamble. They\u2019re both bracketed, which means that neither has a secure place in the final agreement. But they seem almost to argue and rebut each other: The first clause declares: The most developed countries, the global North, are responsible for what became of the climate. But wait, says the second clause: Wouldn\u2019t the global South like to follow the North into prosperity? That means it will bear more responsibility soon. And it means, too, that both sides together must decide what the climate becomes now.","headline":"The Still Unresolved Questions of the Paris Climate Agreement","article_name":419577.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/what-does-the-paris-agreement-say\/419577\/","date_published":"2015-12-10 19:44:36","article_length":9360,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:33.641300","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/what-does-the-paris-agreement-say\/419577\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In which the red knot is the canary, and the planet is the coalmine. Every year, flocks of red knots criss-cross the globe. In the summer, these shorebirds breed in the Arctic circle, making the most of the exposed vegetation and constant daylight. Then, anticipating the returning ice and continuous night, they fly to the opposite end of the world. Different populations have their own itineraries, but all are epically long: Alaska to Venezuela; Canada to Patagonia; Siberia to Australia. These migratory marathons mean that the red knot\u2019s fate in one continent can be decided by conditions half a world away. And that makes it a global indicator, a sentinel for a changing world. It is the proverbial canary in the coalmine, except the mine is the planet. And the canary is shrinking. For the last 33 years, European scientists have been measuring a population of red knots that stop at Poland\u2019s Gdansk Bay on their migrations between northern Russia and western Africa. When Jan van Gils from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research analyzed these measurements, he noticed that the knots have been gradually getting smaller. They\u2019re not alone . Israeli sparrows, Danish hawks, Alaskan polar bears, North Sea fish, and many other animal populations are getting smaller as the world warms. Some scientists suggest that the trend is adaptive: compact bodies are useful in hotter conditions because smaller individuals have a larger surface area for their size, and so lose heat more quickly. Others say it\u2019s maladaptive: the shrunken species are simply undernourished. Their bodies are sculpted at the poles but tested in the tropics, thousands of kilometers away. To find out which explanation applied to the knots, van Gils analyzed satellite images of the birds\u2019 Russian breeding grounds. These pictures revealed that the region\u2019s snow has been melting earlier and earlier. Thirty years ago, it was disappearing in mid-July. Now, it\u2019s gone by late June, some two weeks prior. And the earlier the melts happen, the smaller the young knots get. Why? It\u2019s probably because red knot chicks mainly feed on the insects that emerge from defrosting Arctic soil. If the snow melts too early, the hatchlings miss out on Peak Insect and can\u2019t eat enough to pack on weight. They end up small and stunted. Van Gils admits that this part of the story is still a little speculative. What\u2019s clearer is that the knots never compensate for their stunted growth. If they leave Russia small, they arrive in Mauritania small. And that\u2019s a big problem. Smaller birds have shorter bills and can\u2019t reach the abundant clams buried in the Mauritanian mud. Every missing millimeter translates to a lot of missing meals. For example, van Gils calculated that a bird with a four-centimeter bill can reach two-thirds of all the available clams, but one with a three -centimeter bill can reach just one third. These shorter-billed individuals must resort to eating other species of shellfish (which are rarer) or on seagrass (which is less nutritious). This inefficient foraging costs them dearly. By tracking individual knots using colored leg rings, Van Gils\u2019 team found that short-billed juveniles were half as likely to show up in Mauritania for a second winter than long-billed peers. It\u2019s possible that they flew off to new pastures, but van Gils doubts it. \u201cThere are very few sites where these birds go, and hardly any of our birds turned up at the other places,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really think they died.\u201d This is one of the few studies to clearly investigate the consequences of smaller size, says Celine Teplitsky from the CNRS in France. It shows that climate change can affect the lives of animals in indirect and large-scale ways, \u201ceven in places where the change is relatively mild.\u201d Earlier snowmelts in the Arctic mean that knots grow up with smaller bills, can\u2019t eat enough in Africa, and die early. Their bodies are sculpted at the poles but tested in the tropics, thousands of kilometers away. \u201cThis presents a call to arms for the scientific community,\u201d says Meg Crofoot from the University of California, Davis, who notes that many researchers only study migratory species at their breeding sites. \u201cMany long-distance migrants are too small to track using existing technology, so their migratory routes and key stop-over locations are poorly described. In some cases, even the location of their wintering grounds remain a mystery. Several developments will help to reveal the routes of these unknown migrations. Tracking devices are getting lighter and less obtrusive, allowing researchers to follow the movements of the tiniest of migrants. One such study revealed the 70,000-kilometer round-trip of the Arctic tern. Another showed that three swifts probably flew non-stop for 200 days .\u00a0 These trackers will allow van Gils and others to track particular birds throughout their lives. Satellites could help, too. The ICARUS Initiative is developing a system for tracking small animals at global scales, using tags that can be sensed from the International Space Station. Meanwhile, scientists are working to combine and open up their disparate data sets, to get a more comprehensive picture of the world\u2019s animal travelers. Their work is urgent. In the last thirty years, an estimated 400 million songbirds have disappeared from Europe . Red knot populations have halved. Van Gils has found that the bar-tailed godwit, the world\u2019s longest non-stop flier , is also shrinking in both body and bill. The race is on to understand the lives of these migrants before planes become the only things speeding through intercontinental skies.","headline":"Climate Change Is Shrinking Earth\u2019s Far-Flying Birds","article_name":482379.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/05\/climate-change-is-shrinking-earths-far-flying-birds\/482379\/","date_published":"2016-05-12 18:00:00","article_length":5632,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:33.980549","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/05\/climate-change-is-shrinking-earths-far-flying-birds\/482379\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"One scientist started in the Arctic Ocean and ended up crossing the Russia-Finland border on a folding bicycle procured in Germany. Shortly after he arrived on the RV Polarstern at the end of February, Alexey Niubom learned he would not be going home as planned. The 32-year-old engineer from St. Petersburg, Russia, was among roughly 100 crew members staffing the third leg of a yearlong Arctic research campaign aboard the German icebreaker. From the outset, the trip unfolded like a Jules Verne novel, beginning with a four-and-a-half-week journey toward the North Pole aboard another icebreaker\u2014this one Russian\u2014that almost had to turn around because fuel was running low. Now they were drifting across the central Arctic Ocean at the mercy of the winds, the ocean currents, and the sea ice that the Polarstern was intentionally frozen into last October. The original plan was for Niubom\u2019s team to stay aboard the ship until April. Then transport aircraft were supposed to arrive from the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, land on a makeshift sea-ice runway, drop off a fourth crew rotation, and bring the leg-three team back to land. In March, Norway suspended foreign travel because of the pandemic. Under the best conditions, keeping this expedition running for a full year would have been a masterpiece of organization. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC, involves roughly 500 scientists and support staff rotating on and off the Polarstern for several months at a time in order to maintain the experiments and the high-tech research camps that surround the icebreaker like a frozen fiefdom, collecting data on the weather, ice, oceans, and ecosystems of the central Arctic. MOSAiC is the largest Arctic research campaign in history, and to stay on track as the coronavirus pandemic began disrupting global travel, \u201cwe had to change pretty much all of logistics,\u201d says Markus Rex, the expedition lead. \u201cIn mid-March, it became clear that none of our plans will work under the conditions of the pandemic.\u201d Niubom wouldn\u2019t set foot on land again until the middle of June. By that point, after nearly five months at sea, he would have done almost anything to get back to his wife and his young daughter in St. Petersburg as quickly as possible. He just didn\u2019t expect that would mean biking into Russia from Finland on a folding bicycle he had procured in Germany. An employee of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St. Petersburg, Niubom joined MOSAiC to run a seismic system for monitoring tremors in sea ice, and to assist with other ice-related projects. Like most members of the third crew rotation, when he learned he was going to be helping out aboard the Polarstern considerably longer than expected, he took the news in stride. \u201cIn the Arctic, you cannot plan everything as you would like; here you are a hostage to the situation,\u201d Niubom wrote me in an email. And as the pandemic worsened around the world, he tried to see the upside in his situation: \u201cWe\u2019re going without masks and gloves with no fear. We are the only ones in the world who would hold football matches, though on ice.\u201d (For this very international team, football, naturally, meant soccer.) Read: A year on ice Most people who sign up for polar expeditions do so, in part, because they love working in extreme environments\u2014the more unknown, the better. Taneil Uttal , who led MOSAiC\u2019s atmospheric-research team from mid-December through February, chose a winter shift because she \u201cthought it would be the most interesting, unknown, and extreme\u201d leg of the trip. (Normally, she works as a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado.) Being part of MOSAiC\u2019s winter crew meant working outside on days as cold as \u201350 degrees Fahrenheit and knowing what to do when polar bears wander into your research camp; it meant working six and a half days a week on a monochromatic moonscape where the sun never rose. People did all that and more: \u201cThey would come home and have dinner, and then go skiing and walking on the ice,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have bonfires out on the ice, parties out on the ice. People just loved being out on the ice.\u201d MOSAiC researchers were prepared to face isolation and harsh conditions. But tossing out years of painstakingly choreographed logistics and keeping their scientific work going amidst a global pandemic presented a new level of challenge. And although Niubom and his colleagues were steeled to stay aboard the Polarstern as long as was necessary, they also had families to return to, families that needed their support more than ever. \u201cDay by day, the awareness of this problem became clearer, and something had to change,\u201d Niubom said. The pandemic made this hard. At first it seemed like Niubom\u2019s crew might be able to travel home aboard a Swedish icebreaker scheduled to resupply the Polarstern in June. Then, Swedish travel restrictions kicked in, and that vessel was forced to cancel its journey north. After weeks of unsuccessfully attempting to charter icebreaker after icebreaker, MOSAiC\u2019s coordinators drew up an alternate plan : The Polarstern would break free of the ice and travel hundreds of miles south in order to link up with a pair of German vessels. Instead of taking place in mid-April, this maritime crew swap would occur in May. Even that far into spring, when the darkness and the bitter cold of winter had given way to milder weather and endless sunlight, the ship encountered thick sea ice on its journey south, delaying its arrival by about a week. In early June, it finally managed to break through the southern ice edge and link up with the RV Sonne and the RV Maria S. Merian in waters off the coast of Svalbard, where the swap took place. Read: The time I got stranded in Antarctica Once free of the ice, each crew member still had to find a way home. After the ships made port in the German city of Bremerhaven, many participants would need to fly halfway around the world, at a time when global travel remained severely disrupted. Niubom\u2019s situation was particularly challenging: The Sonne and the Merian were due to arrive in Germany on June 15, but there were no flights from Germany to Russia until the end of the month. A direct flight \u201cwould mean for Alexey waiting for two weeks in a hotel in Bremerhaven,\u201d says the MOSAiC coordinator Elena Tschertkowa-Paulenz, who was helping many participants work through travel issues. \u201cHe was not amused about such a scenario.\u201d But Tschertkowa-Paulenz was able to find flights from Germany to Finland, and St. Petersburg isn\u2019t that far from the Finnish border. All trains and buses across the border were suspended, but when Tschertkowa-Paulenz called the Finnish border police, she learned that it would be possible for Niubom to cross in a personal vehicle. Finally, the two devised a plan: Niubom would fly into Helsinki, take a train to the Finnish border town of Imatra, and bike into Russia, which was less than 10 miles away. The central Arctic Ocean is one of the least understood environments on Earth, and a key goal of MOSAiC is to capture the first-ever year-round data set on it. Ultimately, the troves of information scientists are collecting will be used to answer fundamental questions about the Arctic and improve global climate models. Extricating the Polarstern from the ice pack it had been drifting with for months and making the glacially slow trek toward open water meant sacrificing some of that data. All told, the ship\u2019s southward detour resulted in a roughly three-week gap in MOSAiC\u2019s yearlong records, says Rex, the expedition leader. Although this will \u201cabsolutely have an impact\u201d on the science, considering the alternative, Rex sees that impact as \u201cvery mild.\u201d \u201cOther expeditions, pretty much all the other activities I know, had to be canceled because of the corona pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are still up and running.\u201d Read: The power of fear in the thawing Arctic Indeed, as the challenges mounted for MOSAiC, many scientists had to scrap their fieldwork plans altogether. Numerous spring and summer research cruises were delayed by the pandemic; NASA suspended several Earth-science airborne campaigns. Countless researchers abandoned plans to do spring and summer fieldwork abroad as their institutions issued travel restrictions and as countries closed their borders. Many have refocused their efforts on work that can be done remotely. \u201cThe pandemic has already reshaped my research pretty significantly,\u201d says Sarah Cooley , a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University who studies Arctic hydrology. Although Cooley had intended to spend most of April and May in northwest Greenland interviewing locals about changing sea-ice conditions, instead she has spent the past few months in California, working on a completely different project using satellite data. The Cambridge University volcanologist Lis Gallant and her colleagues had to cancel plans to travel to Chile, where they were going to start a project on local perceptions of natural hazards. Her team is now chatting with researchers there about enlisting grad students to lay the groundwork. Likewise, the Columbia University anthropologist Lisa Ilboudo-N\u00e9bi\u00e9 and the climate scientist Weston Anderson are in the process of hiring a field assistant to start the work they now can\u2019t, interviewing pastoralists in Senegal for a study on water resources and food security. Given struggles such as these, and the myriad field expeditions that have been suspended indefinitely because of the coronavirus, MOSAiC\u2019s persistence is a testament to the enormous effort that went into staging the expedition in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s really jaw-dropping that MOSAiC is still running,\u201d says Uttal, the NOAA scientist. The logistical gymnastics its administrators have pulled off to get participants home underscore that. The MOSAiC coordinator Tschertkowa-Paulenz says that under normal circumstances, her logistics department would be involved only in arranging travel to the Polarstern. \u201cBut during corona time, nearly everything was extraordinary,\u201d she says. To get Niubom home, Tschertkowa-Paulenz went on eBay to search for a folding bike that he could pack in his airport luggage. She managed to find one at a \u201creasonable price,\u201d she says, in Bad Bederkesa, a town not far from Bremerhaven. On the evening of June 12, Tschertkowa-Paulenz drove to Bad Bederkesa and bought the bike from a girl named Isabelle. \u201cAs I told her that I need this bicycle to cross the border, I think she thought I am making jokes,\u201d Tschertkowa-Paulenz says. The day Niubom arrived at Bremerhaven, Tschertkowa-Paulenz met him at a train station to hand it off and wished him luck on his adventure. His first challenge was flying from Germany to Finland, already a surreal experience during pandemic times but especially so for someone who had just spent five months on a boat. (\u201cI looked like a dog that was released for a walk for the first time in five months,\u201d he said.) At the airport, he had to check the folding bike in a special case as an extra piece of luggage, which wound up costing about as much as the bike itself. And although Niubom said the bike was in \u201cexcellent condition\u201d when he packed it, by the time he opened that case in Finland, its front and rear lights had been broken. Read: I just flew. It was worse than I thought it would be. Still, he was determined to ride the bicycle into Russia if he could. But by the time he arrived in Imatra that evening, the sun was going down. His 50-pound luggage was bigger than the trunk of the diminutive two-wheeler, and despite his best efforts to tie it down, the luggage fell off en route and had to be re-attached. Between what he was carrying and his own weight, Niubom worried the bike frame would snap in half. On top of all that, he was traversing unfamiliar countryside on roads that were being repaired, and his phone wasn\u2019t connected to the internet. \u201cI had to stop people on the street and ask for directions to Russia,\u201d Niubom said. \u201cIt was getting dark, and I was afraid that I would be left in the woods with a broken bike without food and be bitten by mosquitoes.\u201d The folding bike held out. After an hour and a half, he arrived at the border, which consisted of little more than a road barrier and customs officers. On the Russian side, however, Niubom was detained by a woman from the public-health department who didn\u2019t approve of his plan to order a taxi the rest of the way home. Someone had to pick him up in person, she insisted. He had to sit on a chair, waiting, for about four hours, all the while getting devoured by mosquitoes. \u201cFinally,\u201d Tschertkowa-Paulenz says, \u201cthe border police and the serious lady [gave up] and ordered a taxi for Alexey on themselves.\u201d Niubom arrived home at 3:30 in the morning, exhausted but overjoyed to see his family. He was particularly happy that his 2-year-old daughter still seemed to recognize him. Given everything he went through this year, I was curious to know whether Niubom would sign up for an expedition like MOSAiC again. \u201cNo, suddenly there will be a new virus,\u201d he joked. But he recognizes how fortunate he was to participate. Few of us, after all, will ever step foot on an ice-covered ocean, much less live and work on one for months as the sun creeps over the horizon and the world awakens from a long polar night. \u201cWhen I learned from the news that thousands of Russian citizens could not return from abroad, I realized that it would not be a bad option to continue working on the ship,\u201d Niubom said. \u201cBut in the end, I decided to risk trying to return. Those who don\u2019t take risks don\u2019t drink champagne.\u201d","headline":"A Pandemic Journey That Puts Odysseus to Shame","article_name":615124.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/08\/an-arctic-scientists-dizzying-journey-home-during-the-coronavirus\/615124\/","date_published":"2020-08-10 17:08:10","article_length":13705,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:35.044726","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/08\/an-arctic-scientists-dizzying-journey-home-during-the-coronavirus\/615124\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The agency is forging ahead despite slashed budgets and outdated policies. Five years ago, just after archaeologist Marcy Rockman joined the National Park Service\u2019s new climate change response program, the GOP-controlled Congress slashed its budget by 70 percent. Republicans were determined to squash President Barack Obama\u2019s climate agenda, and many federal officials were deeply discouraged. So Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis convened his top staff and climate team. Rockman says he pounded his fist on a table and bellowed: \u201cSay the \u2018c\u2019 word!\u201d It was a clear battle cry, she adds:\u00a0 \u201cJarvis was so forceful in saying, \u2018We are doing this!\u2019 \u201d With only $2.8 million and a tiny staff, the program began a major research blitz, studying climate change impacts on national parks from Acadia in Maine to American Samoa in the Pacific. Meanwhile, Jarvis convened a panel of independent scientists, who, in 2012, produced a report titled Revisiting Leopold . They urged the agency to jettison its decades-old mandate to preserve each park as a \u201cvignette of primitive America.\u201d Rather, parks should steward America\u2019s treasures through the continuous and unpredictable changes to come. Managers should \u201cact immediately, boldly and decisively\u201d to prepare for volatile conditions, including severe wet seasons and deep droughts, and unite with nearby public lands to address landscape-wide challenges, such as creating corridors for wildlife seeking new habitat. A permanent policy reflecting the panel\u2019s thinking is due out later this year. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge paradigm shift; it\u2019s driven by recognition that climate change is making the former strategy impossible,\u201d says University of Arizona professor Jonathan Overpeck. \u201cThe shift in climatic extremes will affect just about anything in a park, other than the solid rock. The Park Service is taking climate science and climate change seriously, which is really important if we\u2019re going to manage these precious resources into the future.\u201d Many changes are already evident. Yosemite\u2019s Lyell Glacier, which covered 1.2 square kilometers when John Muir first studied in 1872, was down to 0.27 square kilometers. At this rate, park geologist Greg Stock warns, it will vanish completely within 10 years. Glacier National Park\u2019s much larger glaciers have shrunk tremendously, too. Scientists project other dire consequences for Western parks if humans fail to kick the fossil fuels habit: rampant wildfires, rivers too hot for native trout, mountaintops too warm for snow-dependent mammals like snowshoe hare and Canada lynx. The parks are working to slash their own emissions. The visitors\u2019 center at California\u2019s Pinnacles National Park, for instance, was built with renewable power and runs on electricity from solar panels. Passenger vehicles are no longer welcome in Zion during the summer. And parks are educating the public about climate change. But they\u2019ve been slower to adapt management practices. There are good reasons, says Tom Olliff, division chief of landscape conservation and climate change for the Intermountain West Region. Science takes time, as does crafting good policy. And managers are rightfully conservative, says Olliff, because their mission is to leave these magnificent landscapes \u201cunimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\u201d Still, some parks are charging ahead. At Golden Gate National Recreation Area, several beach restoration projects are in the works due to erosion caused partly by sea-level rise. At Stinson Beach, the park recently removed its old sewage treatment system on the beach and installed a new one high in the bluffs. For the last three springs, Utah\u2019s Timpanogos Cave National Monument has attached pheromone packets to 100 Douglas firs along a steep paved trail to the cave, hoping to help them avoid joining a West-wide bark beetle outbreak exacerbated by climate change. With the program\u2019s budget still stuck at $2.8 million, Rockman finds it hard to do the job she was hired to do: assessing cultural treasures\u2019 vulnerability to climate change. Most available funding goes to protect historic coastal buildings from sea-level rise and storm surge; a 2015 analysis of 40 coastal parks determined that buildings worth $40 billion are at high risk over the next century. But Rockman worries that the West\u2019s archaeological and historic treasures have as-yet-unidentified weaknesses. She wonders if climate change is responsible for crumbling adobe structures at some Southwestern parks. After major deluges uncommon around Tucson, cracks opened up underneath windows at Tumac\u00e1cori Mission. And following another intense rain, an adobe wall collapsed at New Mexico\u2019s Fort Union, the region\u2019s largest 19th century fort. \u201cIf we don\u2019t catch those in time, those resources are just as gone as if they\u2019d been taken away by a storm surge,\u201d she says. Anne Carlson, climate adaptation specialist for The Wilderness Society, says the agency has accomplished much in a short time with little money. That it hasn\u2019t done more reflects the scale and nature of the challenge, she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been through climate change before. It is extremely difficult to figure out what to do to adapt to something we have never experienced as a species before.\u201d This article appears courtesy of High Country News .","headline":"How the Park Service Is Planning for Climate Change ","article_name":497042.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/08\/how-the-national-park-service-is-planning-for-climate-change\/497042\/","date_published":"2016-08-24 12:00:00","article_length":5295,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:35.156810","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/08\/how-the-national-park-service-is-planning-for-climate-change\/497042\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Joe Biden\u2019s victory isn\u2019t on the list. Every Tuesday, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . It\u2019s been an enormous month and a half for climate-change news in the United States. First, and most obvious, Joe Biden won the presidential election on a vow to put climate policy at the center of his domestic and foreign policy. That was a big deal. Then he actually started to do it. He\u2019s named climate experts to senior White House positions and laid the foundation for an ambitious and diverse so-called climate Cabinet. Just last week, Biden said he would nominate Representative Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior , which oversees federal lands. If confirmed, she would be the first Indigenous American in that role. Then, yesterday, Congress passed a bipartisan superbill (note: this is not a technical term) combining economic stimulus, federal spending, and several years of industrial policy. Glooped onto the text were several energy and environment bills that will steer the federal ship of state toward decarbonization . The bill extends tax credits for renewable energy and carbon capture, it funds energy-efficiency projects, and it recommends\u2014 in a legally nonbinding way \u2014that the Department of Energy prioritize projects that will help generate 100 percent of U.S. electricity through \u201cclean, renewable, or zero emissions energy sources.\u201d But. These were not the only climate stories of 2020. This year has been so jammed with news\u2014much of it with urgent, imminent, and life-altering implications\u2014that I think many people might have missed the most important climate developments. 2020 was a monumental year for climate news\u2014and it would have been even if Biden had lost. Many of the world\u2019s most powerful institutions changed how they thought about climate change this year. Climatic upheaval and the energy transition, both of which had long figured distantly in leaders\u2019 planning, became a near-term economic issue. So 2020, I\u2019d wager, is the year that the climate became the economy. If Biden\u2019s policy reflects that change\u2014for instance, he named Brian Deese, a financier and one of President Barack Obama\u2019s top climate advisers, to lead the National Economic Council \u2014then it\u2019s because he\u2019s aligning with that new consensus as much as setting it. So, with that in mind, here are the top five climate stories of 2020: 1. The most important story of 2020 was President Xi Jinping\u2019s announcement that China would aim to start reducing its carbon pollution by 2030\u2014and achieve net-zero by 2060 . His promise, which came in two sentences in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September, was a total surprise. But it was crucial. China is the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is responsible for 30 percent of global carbon pollution, and\u2014unlike the rich countries of North America and Europe\u2014its emissions are still growing. China\u2019s model of economic growth is also dependent on creating mind-bending amounts of carbon-intensive steel and concrete. (As a certain type of global thinker will never tire of repeating, China poured more concrete from 2011 to 2013 than the U.S. did in the entire 20th century .) So China\u2019s vow is significant in its own right: It signifies the future elimination of a colossal amount of CO\u2082. It shows, too, that China\u2019s ruling party is worried about climatic turbulence. As the historian Adam Tooze has written : \u201cIt is precisely because the Communist Party regime is bent on shaping the next century that its leader takes climate change seriously.\u201d It also reveals\u2014 as a December speech by Xi did , too\u2014that China is willing to compete with the West over who can cut carbon the fastest. But it points to a more important development than even that, I\u2019d argue. China set the pattern for rapid 21st-century development through its coal and construction-heavy economy. (A pattern modeled, of course, on the United States and Europe.) If Xi can figure out how to peak China\u2019s carbon pollution while the country still grows economically, then China could fashion a new kind of development model for other countries to follow. Such a model wouldn\u2019t just reduce existing emissions from China, but prevent future emissions from other countries\u2014because they would be able to follow China\u2019s lower-carbon path. As for specifics, we don\u2019t have many. We\u2019ll get a better sense of how China plans to meet its goal early next year, when it unveils the climate aspects of its next five-year plan. 2. Earlier this month, European Union leaders agreed to strengthen the Continent\u2019s climate goals and pledged a new target of 55 percent greenhouse-gas reduction by 2030. The old goal was a 40 percent cut by that year. What\u2019s  more important than the cuts themselves is their political context. They emerged out of deadlocked talks over a 1.8-trillion-euro package meant to fight the coronavirus recession. The stimulus aimed to spark a climate-friendly recovery, part of what the EU calls the \u201c European Green Deal .\u201d But crucially, the package also pushed the 27 member countries into a closer financial union, allowing the EU to issue joint debt for the first time. The stimulus was first proposed in the spring. It immediately encountered resistance: Hungary and Poland, both led by far-right prime ministers, argued that the EU stimulus should not be dependent on upholding anti-corruption rules. They threatened to join forces with the Netherlands, Sweden, and other rich countries that wanted a veto over issuing joint EU debt . Thankfully, that didn\u2019t happen. On December 10, the member nations held marathon talks and finally agreed on a compromise . Then, having reached that deal, German President Angela Merkel immediately held more talks through the night\u2014which produced, on December 11 , the new climate goal. The goal is big enough to matter: The EU is the world\u2019s third-biggest carbon polluter , responsible for about 8 percent of emissions. The deal, in my view, shows how political stability drives climate diplomacy: The Continent will be able to do far more on climate change working together, and issuing debt together, than separately. And maybe most important, it shows how China\u2019s pledge is driving other countries to make even bigger cuts. The EU must now cut more carbon in the next decade than it has since 1990. 3. The pandemic\u2014and its lessons. The pandemic has had a direct influence on climate change: Greenhouse-gas pollution is projected to drop this year by about 7 percent , a record decline from 2019. This is the kind of emissions reduction that no one wants to see, because it flows not from reducing fossil-fuel use in the economy, but from a breakdown in the economy itself. Yet it\u2019s a decline nevertheless. We may soon be able to discern a faint COVID-19 signal in the Keeling curve , the chart of atmospheric CO\u2082 concentration over time. Of course, the economy will soon come roaring back\u2014and emissions with it. What\u2019s likely to endure are the lessons of the pandemic. The virus revealed that the global economy remains vulnerable to physical shocks, even ecological shocks: The global recession of 2020, unlike the global financial crisis or the dot-com bust, was caused not by turbulence in the financial system but by damage to the network of flesh, steel, and wire that physically constitutes the global economy. At the same time, we learned that focused government funding and attention can accelerate the deployment of life-changing technology. Operation Warp Speed, the federal program to develop COVID-19 vaccines, has produced two safe and effective vaccines within a year of the virus\u2019s discovery. A similar approach could work if applied to clean energy and other climate tech , too. Another lesson: A society-wide shift in behavior can\u2019t solve climate change. Consider how differently Americans lived this year versus last year. Tens of millions of people stopped regularly commuting. We stayed at home more and took fewer flights. Enormous office towers went essentially uninhabited. Yet America\u2019s carbon pollution is projected to decline by only about 12 percent from 2019 . Even in April, at the peak of global shutdowns, when cars, trains, and planes sat idle across much of the world, American emissions declined by only about a third , and global emissions declined by 17 percent. 4. The markets began to consider the cost of climate change\u2014and the benefits of the energy transition. For years, we climate reporters have said that solar and wind energy are becoming price-competitive with fossil fuels. This was the year that global markets really seemed to notice. Across the world, but especially in the United States, we saw a concerted move toward recognizing the potential of zero-carbon energy. In October, the International Energy Agency pronounced solar \u201cthe cheapest electricity in history.\u201d NextEra Energy, a Florida firm that sells wind and solar electricity to utilities, became one of the country\u2019s most valuable energy companies , its value rivaling that of Exxon and Chevron. More and more venture capital is going to climate-tech start-ups, according to the accounting giant PwC . And funds tracking the solar and wind industry consistently outperformed the S&P 500. This year, too, asset managers woke up to the risks of climate impacts, especially sea-level rise and wildfires. The home-insurance market in California started to strain , and coastal homes in Florida lost value . Financiers seemed to decide en masse, too, that oil and gas stocks posed too much risk to the rest of their portfolio. The oil-and-gas sector became one of the smallest sectors, if not the smallest, of the S&P 500 by market value. (It doesn\u2019t help that oil stocks have underperformed for a decade.) Every major American bank promised to stop funding Arctic drilling. Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s largest insurance market, said it would stop covering coal, oil sands, and Arctic drilling projects by 2030 . Exxon laid off 14,000 workers and cut more than $17 billion from the book value of its business. And American regulators woke up to these changes. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees financial derivatives, warned in a bipartisan report that climate change could damage the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve became the last major central bank worldwide to join the Network for Greening the Financial System, a coalition that looks at systemic financial risk from climate change. There were fluky moments in this transition. Tesla\u2019s stock price rose 700 percent this year , part of a surge in demand for electric-car stocks that is, if not bubbly, at least effervescent. A barrel of oil fetched a negative price in April \u2014you had to pay someone to take oil off your hands\u2014but that happened as much for market-structure reasons as for trend-driven ones. All this market movement doesn\u2019t supplant the need for policy. Some of these changes are happening because investors expect policy to arrive, not because it\u2019s already here. But taken together, they show that the world\u2019s most powerful financial institutions believe that the future is decarbonized\u2014and that, far from hurting the economy, climate action is likely to help it. 5. Finally, let\u2019s talk about that bill. Yes, the bipartisan bill that Congress just passed. I haven\u2019t mentioned its most important emissions-cutting measure: It commits the U.S. to phasing out a type of chemical called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. Though normally used in refrigerators or air conditioners, HFCs can escape into the atmosphere and trap heat thousands of times more effectively than carbon dioxide. Because HFCs are so potent, phasing them out has monumental climate benefits. So this bill will avert the equivalent of more CO\u2082 emissions than Germany emits in a year. It may be \u201cthe single most effective emission reduction measure taken by Congress in over a decade,\u201d according to the Rhodium Group , an energy-analysis firm. When joined with other action to phase out HFCs worldwide, it could avert one-fifth to half a degree Celsius of warming by 2100. Consider even that a low-ball estimate. Under the Paris Agreement, the world committed to averting 2 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. A global phaseout of HFCs gets us 10 percent of the way there. That\u2019s actual progress\u2014and some truly good news to end an awful year. Thanks for reading. Did someone forward you this newsletter?

{"id":null,"body":"The president is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change because he just can\u2019t quit carbon. The United States began the formal process of leaving the Paris Agreement on climate change yesterday, withdrawing on the first day it was legally possible. Barring something unforeseen, the country will depart the accord on November 4, 2020\u2014a day after the next presidential election. If it feels like the Paris withdrawal has been coming for years, that\u2019s not wrong. It was already clear on the day he was elected that President Donald Trump would leave the Paris Agreement. After some vacillating early in his term, Trump made a sunny, pomp-dense Rose Garden speech in June 2017 and promised to depart the treaty. But under the agreement\u2019s terms, he could not formally notify the United Nations of his intent to leave until this week, and American diplomats attended climate negotiations in the interim. Nearly two and a half years later, it\u2019s worth briefly remembering that 2017 speech, which ran to more than half an hour . Scott Pruitt, the only other Cabinet official who spoke at the event, resigned from the Environmental Protection Agency amid scandal a little more than a year later. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (whom Trump later fired ) and Energy Secretary Rick Perry (who will resign before the end of the year) also attended. The effort to leave Paris has by now survived three chiefs of staff, four national security advisers, and 10 Cabinet secretaries. Trump himself really wants to leave the treaty. In that light, the notice-giving yesterday was almost subdued. The president held a campaign rally last night in Lexington, Kentucky, a state with thousands of coal jobs . Yet while Trump could once rhapsodize for 27 minutes straight about the alleged unfairness of Paris, he barely mentioned the agreement last night, referring only twice in passing to the \u201chorrible, costly, one-sided Paris climate accord.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was left to fill the void with a brief press release . There are rumors that the Trump 2020 campaign will try to convince voters of its environmental record, which most Americans disapprove of. Perhaps last night was a preview of that strategy. Back in 2017, the president also promised either to immediately start talks to reenter Paris or to discuss \u201ca really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.\u201d Two years on, no such treaty has appeared. Read: This is what adapting to climate change looks like But this vow was always a little nonsensical, since Paris is a voluntary agreement. After the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty from the 1990s, the United States made a few demands: Any accord must make no legal distinction between rich and poor countries, and it must not include externally imposed, legally binding emissions cuts. (The first of these demands was set forward in a 95\u20130 Senate vote .) So the world produced the Paris Agreement, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between rich and poor countries and which doesn\u2019t impose external binding targets. \u201cWe\u2019re withdrawing from something that\u2019s purely voluntary. It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d says Bentley Allan , a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s reprehensible\u2014it\u2019s absurd that we\u2019re withdrawing.\u201d The only reason to leave such a treaty is if \u201cyou want to actively make the symbolic act of damaging this thing,\u201d Allan told me. In other words, Trump is not leaving the agreement because he doubts climate science. And he is not leaving it because of what the agreement does : He is already rolling back Barack Obama\u2019s domestic climate rules, which actually accomplished the bulk of emissions cuts. Trump is leaving the Paris Agreement because he actually intends to slow the global transition away from fossil fuels. Trump\u2019s political opponents\u2014and, sometimes, the press\u2014often term him a \u201cclimate-change denier .\u201d But in a way, this term actually flatters him. His stated views about climate science are far too messy and opportunistic to bear any coherent label. Here is a man who can tell New York Times editors that \u201cthere is some connectivity\u201d between human activity and climate change and, two years later, say that \u201cpeople like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we\u2019re not necessarily such believers,\u201d before finally proclaiming during a snowstorm that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be bad to have some of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!\u201d All this doesn\u2019t add up to an epistemology: It\u2019s pure trolling, and, as with most trolling, you almost have to admire the chutzpah. In this late hour\u2014well into the fourth decade of modern climate politics\u2014it\u2019s hard to believe that belief in climate change is the main obstacle to battling it. A supermajority of Americans now say that global warming is real, and a majority say that people are making it happen. Yet a federal climate bill is not exactly steaming through Congress. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change No, when Trump pulls America out of the Paris Agreement, he is responding to a different ideology: carbonism . For Trump, carbonism is a powerfully economic and cultural idea. Think of the carbon in carbonism as akin to the nation in nationalism : It implies a founding myth, a powerful worldview, a theory of value, and a prophecy. But it is, at heart, a simple idea. Carbonism is a belief that fossil fuels\u2014which send carbon pollution spewing into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change and ocean acidification\u2014have inherent virtue. That they are better, in fact, than other energy sources. When the Trump administration replaces the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with a new rule that may actually increase pollution , that\u2019s carbonism. When Perry tried to get Americans to subsidize failing coal plants through their power bills, that\u2019s carbonism. When the EPA fights to allow the free venting of methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, that\u2019s carbonism. When the EPA fights to let coal plants have an easier time spewing heavy metals and other neurotoxins into the atmosphere, that\u2019s carbonism. For the Trump administration, carbonism is more powerful than neoliberalism or any theory of free markets. How else to explain the White House\u2019s proposed rollback of fuel-efficiency rules, which\u2014in its hurry to freeze every possible legal restriction on carbon\u2014 actually mixed up the idea of supply and demand ? And for Trump, too, carbonism is more powerful than any belief in federalism or states\u2019 rights. How else to explain his years-long war on California\u2019s statewide climate policy ? For the president, carbonism is visceral. At home, Trump\u2019s carbonist politics are prosperity-focused, locked in the postwar decades, and permeated with nostalgia for old-fashioned race and gender relations. Just as President Ronald Reagan linked black women to government through the epithet welfare queens , Trump has bound carbon pollution to heavy industry and white men. Abroad, Trump\u2019s carbonism is vulgar. Hence his repeated promise that the United States had \u201cthe oil\u201d in Syria, even as it betrayed its Kurdish allies. Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis But carbonism does not need to be so blunt. Consider Pompeo\u2019s statement yesterday on American withdrawal . It is elegant carbonism, citing \u201cthe reality of the global energy mix\u201d instead of that other reality (the warming one). It cites the importance of using \u201call\u201d energy sources \u201ccleanly and efficiently, including fossils fuels.\u201d And when it mentions climate change, it is only to \u201cenhance resilience to the impacts of climate change.\u201d Here we can see the deeper logic of carbonism: that carbon pollution imposes no hard limit on human flourishing, that through the exclusive magic of fossil fuels, society can effortlessly solve any problem. Sometimes these arguments are rooted in accurate understandings of historical progress. Fossil fuels really did make modern excess possible, improving the living standard of hundreds of millions of people. But now that it\u2019s time to move away from fossil fuels, carbonists become desperately anti-progress, or they reuse old arguments in bizarre new ways. Hence Perry\u2019s 2017 claim that fossil fuels somehow reduce sexual assault in \u201cthose villages in Africa.\u201d Carbonism is easy to ignore. Much of the political establishment\u2014including many members of the media\u2014perceive climate change chiefly as an environmental issue. So they scratch their head at Trump\u2019s insistence that he loves \u201cclean air and clean water\u201d even as he cuts rules on toxic air pollution. But there may be no contradiction in Trump\u2019s mind, because he sees carbonism as an economic and cultural idea. And in a way, he is right. Climate change will wreak havoc across the natural world, but its origins\u2014and its worst consequences\u2014will strike at human society. To fight climate change, to decarbonize , is to remake the metabolism of the global economy . Which is to say: It\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s harder than installing a bunch of catalytic converters. But carbonism also surrounds us. To some degree, our political culture is still carbonist; we are all carbonists. While the fretted-over federal-budget deficit is an idea, not a physical fact, the carbon dioxide fumigating into the sky right now is real. It is spilling from gas stoves, pouring out of car tailpipes, and gushing from the coal or gas fire that (in all likelihood) turned the turbine that, at some remove, is making electrons dance across the screen you are reading . Carbon spewing into the atmosphere right now will outlive our grandchildren. It will exist, as a mindless physical fact, trapping heat and distorting geology, for centuries to come. And thanks to the dread logic of the second law of thermodynamics, the heat that it captures will not come out of the atmospheric system for millennia. The Paris Agreement exists because the rest of the world is onto this. Instead of framing fighting climate change as a source of pain, the agreement recognizes that the victors in a post-carbon world will be those who move first. So the European Union and, to a lesser degree, China are pouring money into renewable energy. Even though solar panels were invented in an American lab, by employees of an American company, Germany and China now control the global supply chain that produces them. Even if the United States were to reenter that market, it would have to fight for market share. There\u2019s a standard line here: that when the United States withdraws from the Paris Agreement and treaties like it, it damages American credibility abroad. Such a concern feels a little blas\u00e9 in the wake of our betrayal of the Kurds. If you help us fight the Islamic State and we abandon you, why should anyone trust us over a climate treaty? The damage to American credibility has, to some degree, already been done. The real risk now is to American power. One day, perhaps not long from now, a few global governments will decide that the age of carbon is over. They will back massive investments into remaking the global energy economy, redirecting the turbulent flows of international finance. If the United States is not among those governments, then American banks\u2014whose wealth is deeply bound to fossil fuels\u2014will suffer a sudden revaluation. And the mighty dollar, that last guarantor of American power, will go up in carbonism\u2019s flame.","headline":"Trump Isn\u2019t a Climate Denier.

{"id":null,"body":"When billionaires Tom Steyer, a climate-change activist, and David Koch, a confirmed skeptic, met for the first time, they found a basis for conversation. Tom Steyer and David Koch, the billionaires who waged bitter battles across the airwaves over climate and the environment during the 2014 election, struck conciliatory notes when they met for the first time on Wednesday during a session of the Aspen Ideas Festival. Koch sat in the first row for an interview I conducted with Steyer, the environmental activist and former investment manager whose NextGen Climate Action Committee spent about $75 million in the 2014 election to support candidates committed to action against climate change. Koch, the executive vice president of Koch Industries, is a key figure in the constellation of family-connected political organizations, including Americans for Prosperity, which spent about $100 million over the cycle to support conservative candidates\u2014frequently opposing those Steyer supported. The competition became unusually personal, with the conservative group American Commitment\u2014which had received funding from organizations in the Koch network\u2014 running ads attacking Steyer and his brother Jim, also an activist on issues relating to children. Meanwhile, a wide array of Democrats, led by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, condemned Koch\u2019s role in the election. In an April Huffington Post article , Steyer sharply criticized the Koch brothers\u2019 political activities. \u201cAs we stand at this energy crossroads, the Koch brothers appear to have a strong self-interest in maintaining the status quo\u2014they seem to have no qualms about peddling falsehoods and obscuring the facts,\u201d Steyer wrote. \u201cDo they really intend to keep profiting from pollution that endangers our families?\u201d But toward the end of our interview Wednesday, Steyer struck a more conciliatory tone when I noted that Koch was in the audience and asked Steyer whether he thought the two could ever find common ground on the issues of climate, energy, and the environment. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s skeptical of my views and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m skeptical of his views,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cMy point would be that I think what I\u2019m saying is basically common sense and asking the market to solve a problem that we have. I don\u2019t view this as an ideological issue, actually. I would bet that Mr. Koch thinks that the market is something that is very efficient in allocating capital and getting positive outcomes for the people who work and for the people they\u2019re trying to serve by producing products and services cheaply and efficiently. And that\u2019s what I want.\u201d After the session, Koch chatted amiably with Steyer for several minutes at the foot of the stage. The two then posed for pictures, some with leading venture capitalist John Doerr, another prominent supporter of action against climate change. Later, Steyer and Koch met privately for coffee. Koch is a trustee of the Aspen Institute, which cosponsors the ideas festival with The Atlantic . During the session, Steyer said that he believed the key to breaking the ideological stalemate over climate is \u201cnot that \u2026 we have to agree on the policy; you have to agree on the problem. Once we agree on the problem, then the fact that someone wants a bigger government and someone wants a smaller government ... no, that\u2019s normal American politics. We\u2019ve been doing that for 250 years together; that doesn\u2019t remotely bother me.\u201d Steyer closed with a pitch for American business to take a lead role in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t happened [yet] but \u2026 I believe we will end up pulling on the same oar to solve this and it will be good for American businesses, it will be good for American workers, and it will do something that we\u2019re proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we think we\u2019re doing this without the people who are sophisticated in energy, that\u2019s dumb. We\u2019re going to do this with the people who are sophisticated in energy.\u201d In a meeting with donors earlier this year, the Koch brothers signaled that they hope to donate and raise about $900 million for a network of conservative advocacy groups in the 2016 election cycle. Steyer said in the interview that he also intended to remain active in the 2016 election, but said he had not finalized specific plans on how to do so. But asked if he was in a spending \u201carms race\u201d with conservatives, Steyer demurred, saying: \u201cIf we\u2019re in an arms race, we\u2019re in a lot of trouble.\u201d","headline":"Common Ground on Climate Change","article_name":397559.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/07\/common-ground-on-climate-change\/397559\/","date_published":"2015-07-02 14:09:20","article_length":4468,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:37.957427","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/07\/common-ground-on-climate-change\/397559\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A pair of new studies on sea-level rise show that a crucial climate clock is ticking now. Every week, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . In February 2020, I traveled to New York to celebrate a zeroth birthday and an 80th birthday. First, I saw a close friend\u2019s baby, who had been born only a month earlier. The next day, I went to my grandmother\u2019s birthday party at a crowded Italian restaurant near Times Square. I would say that this experience made me think about aging and what the alleged Soviet spy Alger Hiss (of all people) called \u201c the Great Span \u201d: the way that seemingly distant history is only a few lifetimes away. But this would be a writer\u2019s white lie. I think about time\u2019s bucket brigade probably too much, and I am constantly looking for tidy anecdotes. Weeks earlier, I had already written in the notes app of my phone: \u201cWhen my friend\u2019s baby is my grandmother\u2019s age, it will be 2100.\u201d And 2100 is an important year in climate science. Last week, two major papers on sea-level rise were published. Both try to answer the greatest outstanding questions about sea-level rise: How much will the oceans rise, and how fast? Their conclusions are either reassuring or frightening, depending on your optimism about how quickly the world will get a handle on its carbon pollution. The first paper , written by 84 scientists, shares the results from a portfolio of the newest climate models and is clearly meant to shape the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s sixth assessment report. If countries follow the path they have currently committed to under the Paris Agreement, the world\u2019s average temperature will rise about 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. That will induce about 25 centimeters, or about 10 inches, of sea-level rise, according to the median model run, the new paper finds. But if countries manage to hold warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as they now aspire to do , then the median sea-level rise falls to about half that amount. But the second paper has a more worrying message. Led by the glaciologists Rob DeConto and David Pollard, it looks specifically at how Antarctica will melt. For the past few years, DeConto and Pollard have investigated a hypothetical phenomenon called marine ice-cliff instability  that could vastly accelerate Antarctica\u2019s demise. Several of the largest glaciers in West Antarctica form massive ice cliffs that rise hundreds or thousands of feet above the ocean\u2019s surface. DeConto and Pollard have worried that, as the ocean warms, these ice cliffs could destabilize, entering a runaway feedback loop that disintegrates the entire glacier in a matter of decades. It would be bad. (Other researchers doubt that this rapid decay is even possible: It was the hottest debate in glaciology in the 2010s.) Happily, DeConto and his colleagues found that rapid ice-cliff collapse is unlikely to happen if we keep global temperature rise below 1.5 or even 2 degrees Celsius. But if countries continue on their current path of 3 degrees Celsius, then ice cliffs could very well decay and abruptly bump the pace of sea-level rise after 2060. Sea levels would rise about an inch every five years by 2100 entirely because of Antarctica; ice melt from Greenland, mountain glaciers, and the expansion of warmer ocean water would contribute too. That pace is at least 10 times what Antarctica is contributing today. I\u2019ll have more to say on these studies soon. But first I\u2019d note that the first paper goes up to only 2100. That year has been the end date for climate projections since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s first summary report, in 1990. Yet when sea-level-rise scientists share further projections of their work at academic panels, and in the DeConto and Pollard paper, many of the results are scarier for the 22nd century. Some runaway feedback loops that have not kicked in by 2100 will kick in by 2150. \u201cWho cares?\u201d you might think. \u201cThat\u2019s a long way away, and surely we\u2019ll have technology to modify the climate by then.\u201d But that gets to the second  and more interesting finding of DeConto and Pollard\u2019s paper. They also model the effect of direct carbon removal: What would happen if we stayed on the current high-pollution pathway until 2040, 2050, or 2060, and then\u2014in a moment of pique\u2014began to aggressively remove carbon from the atmosphere? And here the runaway nature of marine ice-cliff instability really kicks in. If you start rapid carbon removal anytime after 2070, they find, West Antarctica\u2019s largest glaciers have already slipped into a feedback loop of doom. The problem becomes unfixable. If you begin carbon removal by 2060, on the other hand, then you can preserve much more of the ice sheet. Ten years, in other words, makes a world of difference. That tight timeline is one reason that I think it\u2019s important to spend public funds on direct carbon-removal technology today. I read once that it takes about as long to develop a new technology as it does to raise a child. We need to start the clock on carbon removal now so it will be ready when we need it. It\u2019s worth remembering how quickly American progressives\u2019 positions on the timing of climate policy have shifted; a few years ago, the leftmost senators endorsed the 100 by \u201950 Act . This bill aimed to phase out fossil fuels on the power grid by 2050; President Joe Biden\u2019s target for the same goal is now 15 years earlier. (He shares the bill\u2019s larger goal of reaching a net-zero economy by 2050.) The U.S. target has moved forward for many reasons, among them that the public now better understands the dangers of overshooting 1.5 degrees Celsius. But these closer targets, I have come to think, are not just better for the planet\u2019s long-term geologic stability. They are easier to think with too; they bring climate change within our mental horizons. I entered the full-time labor force in 2013, and the software that runs my 401(k) account assumes that I will retire sometime between 2055 and 2065. By then, under the Biden plan, the U.S. should be ironing out the final kinks in its decarbonization, and developing countries should be near to joining it. I say should ; nothing is certain\u2014a technological leap, a political upheaval, or, God forbid, world war could derail the timing. But aiming to settle climate change within the U.S. by 2050 is clarifying nonetheless. It puts decarbonization on the same timeline as questions about how to spend a life\u2014where to work and live, whether to start a family, and the rest. The 2050 timeline means that decarbonizing will be the work of a lifetime: my lifetime. You could say our lifetime, if you were born between 1980 and 2005. We will see the task through. For people much older, the journey will end with miles left to travel; for younger people, decarbonizing will\u2014or, at least, should \u2014be something like a solved problem. A child born today won\u2019t enter the professional workforce until 2043; under the current timeline, decarbonization will be just about licked by the time they turn 30. Their job will be to live with climate change: They will see Antarctica\u2019s crucial 2050s in the prime of their career. Today\u2019s babies are the scientists, engineers, and policy staff who will deal with marine ice-cliff instability. James Hansen turned 80 earlier this year. In 1988, when he presented his climate models to the Senate, he was 47. The year 2100 was a long time away\u2014far outside any plausible policy-making range. But 2100\u2019s Social Security beneficiaries are today\u2019s toddlers. Their children will see the 22nd century.","headline":"2050 Is Closer Than 1990","article_name":618861.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/05\/2060s-are-so-important-climate-change-glacier-carbon-removal\/618861\/","date_published":"2021-05-12 00:33:32","article_length":7725,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:38.092265","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/05\/2060s-are-so-important-climate-change-glacier-carbon-removal\/618861\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Candidates who say humans are heating up the planet and want action are vanishing from view\u2014literally. Until the final moments of Tuesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate, nearly everything viewers heard about global warming and energy came during the commercials. The American Petroleum Institute, which is the oil-and-gas industry\u2019s lobbying arm, and lefty billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate group ran dueling ads touting the virtues of drilling versus\u00a0fighting climate change with renewable energy. That was a lot more than the brief onstage shout-outs to more oil-and-gas development, and rolling back President Obama\u2019s carbon-emissions rules that Republicans almost uniformly call an economic disaster. But in the final question of the night, Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo went there: She reminded Senator Rand Paul that he was among among 15 Republicans who voted for an amendment declaring that human activity contributes to climate change. \u201cPresident Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions. At the same time, energy production in America has boomed. Is it possible to continue this boom, and move toward energy self-sufficiency, while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate-change program?,\u201d she asked. \u201cThe first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the president has put in place,\u201d Paul replied to applause, before singling out Obama\u2019s sweeping mandate to cut power-plant emissions. The Kentucky Republican then took stock of the reality of human-induced global warming with a resounding maybe. \u201cWhile I do think that man may have a role in our climate, I think nature also has a role. The planet's 4.5 billion years old, we've been through geologic age after geologic age. We've had times when the temperature's been warmer, we've had times when the temperature's been colder. We've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher. So, I think ... we need to look before we leap,\u201d he said. Bartiromo\u2019s question was a flashback to Paul\u2019s vote on one of the climate-related amendments that the Senate rejected while debating the Keystone pipeline on January 21. But she didn\u2019t ask about the very next vote that day, which was on liberal Democrat Brian Schatz\u2019s amendment, one that better summed up what scientists believe by stating that it\u2019s \u201cextremely likely\u201d that higher global temperatures stem from human activities and that people contribute \u201csignificantly\u201d to climate change. That one drew just four GOP votes as Paul and most of the other 15 Republicans backed away. One of those four was South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, who, like Paul, is running for president. But viewers were given no clue as to his candidacy Tuesday night. Graham\u2019s microscopic polling numbers were too dismal to make even the earlier \u201ckids table\u201d debate that aired at 7 p.m. Also excluded was New York Governor George Pataki, who flatly says humans are heating up the Earth. \u201cOne of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts,\u201d he said at a late October debate. Pataki has even tried to use his climate stance as a way to get traction in the GOP contest, saying over Twitter a month earlier that climate change is real and he would \u201cshout it from the rooftops.\u201d It linked to a fundraising page. Pataki, when he was New York\u2019s governor, helped launch a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions from power plants in northeastern states. In the October 28 debate, however, he emphasized more common GOP themes of encouraging private-sector innovation. Graham, for his part, spent months negotiating a sweeping bill to limit greenhouse gases in 2010 with then-Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, but then he walked away from the talks, making the bill\u2019s already steep climb even tougher without a GOP co-sponsor. It never got a vote. There is plenty of distance between Graham and most Democrats on climate policy\u2014he has voted against EPA's regulation of carbon emissions. But at the late October debate, he made his views on the science clear, noting: \u201cI've talked to the climatologists of the world, and 90 percent of them are telling me that greenhouse-gas effect is real, that we're heating up the planet.\u201d It is, to be sure, awfully hard to imagine that climate change has anything to do with the polling numbers that reshuffled the debate lineups. But the disappearance of Graham and Pataki from the stage, and the demotion of another climate-change acknowledger, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to the lower-tier debate Tuesday underscores how small a role climate change will have in the Republican presidential primary\u2014even as others in the party demonstrate an increasing willingness to discuss the issue. Republicans are having something of a moment on global warming. In September, 11 House GOP lawmakers introduced a resolution calling for action to address climate change, while three weeks ago New Hampshire\u2019s Kelly Ayotte became the first\u2014and thus far only\u2014Senate Republican to support Obama\u2019s sweeping power-plant rule. But when it comes to the GOP race, climate change has been largely an afterthought among the main contenders in the fractious GOP field. Donald Trump flatly rejects global warming, and Ben Carson has questioned evidence of global warming and has said, \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be cooling or warming going on.\u201d Marco Rubio, who is rising in the polls, voted against both those Senate amendments and has been openly skeptical about whether humans are having a substantial effect. Jeb Bush, who came into the race with a more moderate pedigree, has argued that humans play some role but says it\u2019s unclear how much. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, also on the more moderate end of the field, told National Journal through a spokesman this summer, \u201cWe know man has an im\u00adpact, and we know we need to do something.\u201d But Bush and Kasich have nonetheless downplayed the issue during the campaign. And both have unveiled energy-policy platforms that call for rolling back Obama\u2019s plans and expanding domestic drilling, with low-carbon energy addressed more obliquely via\u00a0support for efficiency and basic research into green energy. Neither plan mentions climate change or global warming, but\u00a0Bush\u2019s plan explicitly references the topic in calling for repeal of \u201cObama\u2019s Carbon Rule.\u201d On Tuesday night, Bush did, however, offer his own answer to the climate question that went to Paul. He heralded the role of natural gas\u2014which produces fewer carbon emissions than the coal it\u2019s displacing in power production\u2014in lowering U.S. greenhouse gases and argued more broadly that \u201chigh growth is the path to lower carbon and more jobs.\u201d That was more on the topic than Ted Cruz got a chance to say. The Texas senator tried to jump in, but Bush had already begun talking. But he will get another chance. Cruz, who flatly disputes the existence of global warming, has got the money and poll numbers to stay firmly in the mix.","headline":"On Climate Change, Faint Lights Fade in GOP White House Race","article_name":447801.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/on-climate-change-faint-lights-fade-in-gop-white-house-race\/447801\/","date_published":"2015-11-11 17:02:00","article_length":7013,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:38.915381","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/on-climate-change-faint-lights-fade-in-gop-white-house-race\/447801\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"These GOP lawmakers and candidates could shape their party's future on global warming. Several Republicans who aren't the usual suspects could play important roles in the next battles over global warming. At the highest-profile posts, the GOP climate positions are basically set in stone. The famously climate change-denying James Inhofe is taking control of the Senate's environment panel. And new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is preparing fresh legislative attacks on President Obama's climate agenda. But other Republicans contain more mysteries\u2014or at least have more complicated histories\u2014when it comes to addressing climate change. And as 2015's climate fight plays out, the decisions they make will provide clues into the Republican Party's future. Here are seven Republicans to watch: Rep. Chris Gibson The upstate New York lawmaker wants to chip away at the rejection of climate science that's common within GOP ranks. He served notice of his quest in early December by announcing plans for a resolution aimed at getting his party to accept the scientific consensus on global warming. The party, he said, must \"operate in the realm of knowledge and science.\" \"My district has been hit with three 500-year floods in the last several years, so either you believe that we had a one-in-over-100-million probability that occurred, or you believe as I do that there's a new normal, and we have changing weather patterns, and we have climate change. This is the science,\" Gibson said last month. Gibson's office hasn't divulged details of his plan yet. But when it arrives, it's sure to attract attention at a time when the party's leaders are waging fresh assaults against the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon-emissions rules. Gibson's ability to gain GOP supporters will be a barometer of whether a shift within the party could happen anytime soon. Gibson may be especially emboldened heading into the new congressional session. A GOP source confirmed that he's not planning to seek reelection to a fourth term in 2016 and may seek another office in 2018, news first reported late Monday night in Roll Call . Sen. Lindsey Graham The South Carolina Republican will lead the Senate subcommittee that sets spending for the State Department and other foreign operations. That means Graham could help or hurt Obama's push for $3 billion for the Green Climate Fund, an international initiative to help poor nations battle global warming. The White House will formally ask Congress for a chunk of the money when Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget request arrives early this year. Many Republicans have already bashed the proposal, but Graham has a history on the issue of climate change with Secretary of State John Kerry. In 2009 and 2010, those two and then-Sen. Joe Lieberman spent months trying to write a sweeping climate bill. Graham ultimately bailed on the talks, taking any hope of GOP support with him, and the bill collapsed. Can Graham and Kerry rekindle their cooperation a half-decade later? Sen. Cory Gardner Like many Republicans, incoming Sen. Gardner of Colorado\u00a0 doesn't buy into the scientific consensus that human activity is largely driving climate change. Unlike many Republicans, however, Gardner represents a purple state that has voted Democratic in the last two presidential elections. He will sit on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, so the topic is bound to surface repeatedly during his first term. If Gardner makes moves to the center, it would be a sign that Republicans see political jeopardy in the future if they're viewed as roadblocks to thwarting global warming. Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand Paul OK,\u00a0 all the GOP presidential hopefuls are worth watching. But these two stand out. Why? For one thing Bush, Florida's ex-governor, is from a state that's bearing the brunt of sea-level rise, which could mean an extra bright light on his views about tackling climate change. He could face a political crossroads: either playing to the base in a nominating contest where he's not going to win a sprint to the right, or playing the \"governors as problem-solvers\" card that could steer him in a more moderate direction. Thus far, he hasn't chosen the latter route on climate. Bush is a self-proclaimed \"skeptic\" and early pioneer of the now-common GOP \"I'm not a scientist\" refrain on climate change. He made both comments in a 2009 interview with Esquire magazine. And in 2011, he told Fox News, \"What I get a little tired of on the Left is this idea that somehow science has decided all this so you can't have a view.\" As for the Kentuckian Paul, he's a coal-state senator who has strongly attacked EPA regulations. But he's also got a strong dissident streak, breaking with many other Republicans on criminal-justice policy and other issues. The question of whether or not he tries to separate himself on climate policy is worth watching in 2015. Sen. Susan Collins Five years ago, the Maine Republican jumped right into the congressional fray over global-warming policy. Will she do it again? Back when sweeping cap-and-trade legislation still had a pulse in 2009-10, Collins teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to float what they called a better approach. (It was a more streamlined bill that limited pollution from big \"upstream\" energy companies\u2014think coal mining and oil production\u2014and didn't allow a freewheeling market in carbon-pollution credits.) In 2015, the political battles over global warming in Congress will be about rolling back various pieces of Obama's agenda. Collins, as she begins her fourth term, can command attention as one of a dwindling number of GOP moderates. That means the veteran lawmaker, if she chooses, can help determine whether that small band carves out a role for itself in the climate-policy struggles to come. Rep. Garret Graves The newly elected Louisiana lawmaker is the former chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. That means he's had a front-row seat to the effects of sea-level rise and the loss of coastal wetlands, dunes, and other natural barriers against powerful storms. Graves will be on a pair of committees\u2014Natural Resources, and Transportation and Infrastructure\u2014that will provide the chance for him to delve into the effects of climate change on his state and the country. Graves told Bloomberg News recently that \"South Louisiana is somewhat of a canary in a coal mine.\" He has repeatedly made clear that he doesn't like the kind of mandatory carbon-emissions controls that EPA is imposing. But he has made equally clear that he wants to be involved in congressional climate policy (including the work of the Army Corps of Engineers, which he accuses of doing a lousy job protecting his state). \"You obviously have scores of different positions on how to properly balance economic and environmental policy, and I am looking forward to participating in those discussions and sharing some of the unique perspectives from South Louisiana,\" Graves told a New Orleans public radio affiliate last month.

{"id":null,"body":"If the fate of American democracy is on the ballot in November, so too is the future of the planet. With former Vice President Joe Biden leading in the polls and Democratic control of the Senate possible, the United States may soon have the chance, for the first time in more than a decade, to enact urgently needed legislation to address global climate change\u2014but only if Democrats don\u2019t repeat the mistakes they made at the start of the Obama administration. In June 2009, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a comprehensive bill to stave off the worst effects of climate change. The landmark legislation died in the United States Senate, however, even though President Barack Obama supported climate action and Democrats controlled the Senate with a filibuster-proof majority. Other major issues took precedence: securing a stimulus package to address the recession, passing the Affordable Care Act, and enacting the Dodd-Frank financial reform and consumer-protection law. As a result, the United States scuttled its best chance to prevent the havoc of climate disruption. In the ensuing decade, the world hurtled at breakneck speed toward the precipice of climate disaster. The most optimistic scenario now is that we have only a decade left during which we can limit\u2014not prevent\u2014the economic calamity and public-health nightmare that climate disruption will visit upon our children and grandchildren; the worst-case scenario is that we have already passed the tipping point on climate. Read: A new solution to climate science\u2019s biggest mystery Whether we have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate disruption will be decided this November. The Trump administration rolled back nearly every climate action taken by Obama and will double down on those policies in a second term. The United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement the day after the November election and will reenter the agreement and pursue urgent climate action only if Biden wins in November. If the fate of American democracy is on the ballot in November, so too is the future of the planet. It is one more way that the stakes could not be higher in this election. Yet with a pandemic raging, the economy cratering, and systemic racism finally receiving the attention it deserves, there is considerable risk that a Biden administration and its allies in Congress will follow the lead of the Obama administration and prioritize other pressing issues over the need for climate action. If climate action is not a top priority\u2014and one that results in new laws that commit the United States to decarbonization of its economy and allow it to provide global leadership on climate action\u2014no other accomplishment will matter in the long run. At this point, the public is so familiar with the acceleration of climate change that it may dismiss the dire warnings as dreary weather reports. The facts bear repeating. The past five years have been the hottest on record; 19 of the hottest 20 years have occurred since 2001. Polar ice and glaciers are melting. Coral reefs and rainforests are disappearing. Hurricane season comes earlier and more intensely, and every year brings 100-year storms. Read: This is your life on climate change If we fail to limit greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, searing heat, widespread drought, destructive storms, and coastal flooding will become even more common. Rising oceans will envelop coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Boston, New Orleans, and Houston. The Pentagon predicts that mass migration and climate refugees will lead to widespread political instability. Avoiding this fate should be reason enough for the United States to take decisive action on climate early in a Biden administration. Climate action also will have a significant effect on the frequency of future pandemics and the stability of the economy\u2014and Americans who are Black, Indigenous, and people of color will suffer the worst consequences as climate disruption exacerbates existing economic inequality and magnifies health disparities that plague poorer communities. Biden appears to understand: He has made clean-energy investment a central plank of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d platform . His ambitious proposals, if enacted by Congress, would substantially reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States over the next decade and put the country on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, goals the country must reach to limit climate change. President Obama also understood the urgency of climate change, particularly during his second term, when he made climate action more of a priority and imposed regulatory limits on carbon pollution. Even so, he got nowhere with Congress. How can a Biden administration keep history from repeating itself if a Democratic administration once again comes to power during an economic crisis? Read: The Green New Deal has already won Perhaps the answer lies in a different historical precedent, that of the late 1960s and early \u201970s, when the American environmental movement enjoyed its greatest success. Then as now, controversial issues divided the country, including civil rights for Black Americans, equal rights for women, and the war in Vietnam. Those conflicts spilled into the streets, before and after the death of Martin Luther King Jr., igniting riots in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. Americans worried about an imperial presidency, adherence to the rule of law, and threats to democratic norms. President Richard M. Nixon resigned before Congress impeached him, but he had maintained an enemies list, railed against the media, and weaponized law enforcement against peaceful protesters. In a United States roiled by far-reaching social change and turmoil, a desire for consensus and reconciliation emerged, fueling a remarkably bipartisan environmental movement. Protecting the Earth from pollution became an issue about which Americans from all backgrounds could agree. Transformative change ensued, altering industrial practices and waste management nationwide. In the waning days of the Trump administration, amid carnage far greater than the dystopian fantasies peddled by President Donald J. Trump during his inauguration, most Americans want to move beyond divisiveness, partisanship, and the sense that the country cannot come together on issues that matter. With effective leadership from the White House, climate action could be an issue in which the country finds a united purpose, as environmental and labor groups have already. Even in the midst of the pandemic, public opinion has shifted dramatically about the need for climate action: Two-thirds of all Americans recognize the need for climate action. States, cities, and towns across the U.S. are pursuing bold climate-mitigation and resiliency programs. Read: Voters really care about climate change Major corporations such as Google, Microsoft, and Walmart devote significant resources to sustainability programs, and more than 100 companies now have internal carbon-pricing policies. The Business Roundtable made the commitment last year to \u201cprotect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.\u201d Market forces are driving the United States toward a clean-energy economy, as wind and solar energy rapidly expand and become less expensive than traditional fossil fuels. Moreover, the transition to a carbon-free economy will require major infrastructure investment that aligns well with the fiscal policies that most economists advocate to address the economic fallout from the pandemic\u2014and the disproportionate effect of climate change on poor communities and people of color should make climate action a priority for Americans committed to ending systemic racism. This can be an inflection point in American history, when the country takes dramatic steps to address climate change and protect the health and economic security of all Americans. If we fail to do so, the extraordinary crises of today will seem small by comparison.","headline":"The Climate Crisis Is Still a Crisis","article_name":615319.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/climate-crisis-still-crisis\/615319\/","date_published":"2020-08-19 10:00:00","article_length":8041,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:40.006254","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/climate-crisis-still-crisis\/615319\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cEach degree of warming causes way more fire than the previous degree of warming did. And that\u2019s a really big deal.\u201d On a hot July evening last year, a rancher tried to use a hammer and stake to plug a wasp\u2019s nest. The hammer slipped, a spark flew, and a patch of dry grass ignited, according to the Los Angeles Times . Within minutes, the brush fire fed on bone-dry conditions and became too big to control. It soon merged with another blaze and became the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest wildfire in California\u2019s history. It burned almost half a million acres, or roughly 720 square miles, before it was finally extinguished four months later. It killed one firefighter and injured four. Californians may feel like they\u2019re enduring an epidemic of fire. The past decade has seen half of the state\u2019s 10 largest wildfires and seven of its 10 most destructive fires, including last year\u2019s Camp Fire, the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire ever. A new study, published this week in the journal Earth\u2019s Future, finds that the state\u2019s fire outbreak is real \u2014and that it\u2019s being driven by climate change. Since 1972, California\u2019s annual burned area has increased more than fivefold, a trend clearly attributable to the warming climate, according to the paper. The trend is dominated by fires like the Mendocino Complex Fire\u2014huge blazes that start in the summer and feed mostly on timberland. Over the past five decades, these summertime forest fires have increased in size by roughly 800 percent. This effect is so large that it is driving the state\u2019s overall increase in burned area. Read: The simple reason that humans can\u2019t control wildfires Why are summertime forest fires so much more likely? Because climate change has already redefined the seasons in Northern California. Since the early 1970s, summers in Northern California have warmed by about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees Celsius) on average. A few degrees may not sound like much, but heat has an exponential relationship with forest fire. \u201cEach degree of warming causes way more fire than the previous degree of warming did. And that\u2019s a really big deal,\u201d Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University and an author of the paper, told me. Every additional increment in heat in the environment speeds up evaporation, dries out soil, and parches trees and vegetation, turning them into ready fuel for a blaze. For that reason, Williams said, hot summers essentially overpower anything else happening in Northern California. Even during a wet year, an intense heat wave can choke forests so that it is as though the rain never fell. And it matters that heat is prompting this 800 percent explosion in forest fire\u2014because among the many ways climate change might be messing with the environment, extra heat is among the simplest and most obvious. \u201cHeat is the most clear result of human-caused climate change,\u201d Williams said. In other words, the climate models say that Northern Californian summers should be getting hotter as climate change takes hold. And that\u2019s exactly what the data show\u2014and exactly what\u2019s driving an unprecedented outbreak of forest fires. But this outbreak of climate-addled fires is limited to summertime fires in forests; it does not extend to other types of environment or other times of the year, the paper cautions. Williams and his colleagues found that the amount of burned non-forest area\u2014such as Southern California\u2019s shrub and grassland\u2014has not significantly increased. Read: What it\u2019s like to get caught in a wildfire And while autumn wildfires such as the deadly Camp Fire dominate the news\u2014and while there is some evidence that they may be getting larger\u2014there is still not enough data to say that any increase is statistically significant. But the climate models do suggest that autumn fires across California will get more common as climate change continues to wrack the state. \u201cRevisit this in 20 more years, and we\u2019ll almost definitely be saying, \u2018Yeah, fall fires have the global-warming fingerprint on them.\u2019 But right now we\u2019re still emerging from the range of natural variability,\u201d Williams said. Don Hankins , a professor of geography at California State University at Chico, told me that he wanted to see more data before agreeing with the paper\u2019s results. And he said that some large-scale changes to the landscape\u2014such as the suspension of seasonal burns by indigenous people\u2014may be producing the rise in fire. Williams agreed that climate change is not the only potential driver of increased fire in the state. Over the past century, Americans have gotten better at suppressing fires, meaning that easily burnable fuels may be accumulating in the state\u2019s forests. But he said that even if fires are burning through that excess fuel, the effects of climate change are much clearer in this study, during this time frame. That\u2019s because the fundamental relationship between excess heat and additional fire never changes in the study\u2019s data; the correlation is \u201cjust as strong for the last 20 years as for the first 20 years,\u201d he said. That suggests that across the five decades, the forests have remained the same. Only the air temperature has changed. There may be a day when the forests do change. Williams recently asked some of his students to simulate the survival of the state\u2019s forests forward to the end of the century under a worst-case carbon-pollution scenario . They couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible,\u201d he said. The state gets so hot that \u201cin the 2070s, you have individual years where a quarter to a half of all the forest area in California is burning.\u201d But that couldn\u2019t happen: By then, there will be no more forest left to burn. Fires will have finished clearing all of California\u2019s woods. The once-mighty Californian forest will have given way to scrub, grassland, and desert\u2014types of ecosystem that can rebound quickly after a wildfire, or that never burn at all. It\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that all of California\u2019s timberlands will vanish, Williams said. It depends on how we reduce carbon pollution now and in the years to come. The future of the state\u2019s forests, it seems, is up to us.","headline":"California\u2019s Wildfires Are 500 Percent Larger Due to Climate Change","article_name":594016.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/climate-change-500-percent-increase-california-wildfires\/594016\/","date_published":"2019-07-16 11:00:00","article_length":6134,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:40.283688","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/climate-change-500-percent-increase-california-wildfires\/594016\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In a massive new report, federal scientists contradict President Trump and assert that climate change is an intensifying danger to the United States. Too bad it came out on a holiday. On Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, the federal government published a massive and dire new report on climate change. The report warns, repeatedly and directly, that climate change could soon imperil the American way of life, transforming every region of the country, imposing frustrating costs on the economy, and harming the health of virtually every citizen. Most significantly, the National Climate Assessment \u2014which is endorsed by NASA , NOAA , the Department of Defense, and 10 other federal scientific agencies\u2014contradicts nearly every position taken on the issue by President Donald Trump. Where the president has insisted that fighting global warming will harm the economy, the report responds: Climate change, if left unchecked, could eventually cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year, and kill thousands of Americans to boot. Where the president has said that the climate will \u201cprobably\u201d \u201cchange back,\u201d the report replies: Many consequences of climate change will last for millennia, and some (such as the extinction of plant and animal species) will be permanent. The report is a huge achievement for American science. It represents cumulative decades of work from more than 300 authors. Since 2015, scientists from across the U.S. government, state universities, and businesses have read thousands of studies, summarizing and collating them into this document. By law, a National Climate Assessment like this must be published every four years. It may seem like a funny report to dump on the public on Black Friday, when most Americans care more about recovering from Thanksgiving dinner than they do about adapting to the grave conclusions of climate science. Indeed, who ordered the report to come out today? It\u2019s a good question with no obvious answer. The report is blunt: Climate change is happening now, and humans are causing it. \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,\u201d declares its first sentence. \u201cThe assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble the recent past is no longer valid.\u201d At this point, such an idea might be common wisdom\u2014but this does not make it any less shocking, or less correct. For centuries, humans have lived near the ocean, assuming that the sea will not often move from its fixed location . They have planted wheat at its time, and corn at its time, assuming that the harvest will not often falter . They have delighted in December snow, and looked forward to springtime blossoms, assuming that the seasons will not shift from their course. Now, the sea is lifting above its shore, the harvest is faltering, and the seasons arrive and depart in disorder. The report tells this story, laying simple fact on simple fact so as to build a terrible edifice. Since 1901, the United States has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat waves now arrive earlier in the year and abate later than they did in the 1960s. Mountain snowpack in the West has shrunk dramatically in the past half century. Sixteen of the warmest 17 years on record have occurred since 2000. This trend \u201ccan only be explained by the effects that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, have had on the climate,\u201d the report says. It warns that if humans wish to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming, they must dramatically cut this kind of pollution by 2040. On the other hand, if greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise, then the Earth could warm by as much as 9 degrees by 2100. \u201cIt shows us that climate change is not a distant issue. It\u2019s not about plants, or animals, or a future generation. It\u2019s about us, living now,\u201d says Katharine Hayhoe , an author of the report and an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University. The report visits each region of the country, describing the local upheavals wrought by a global transformation. Across the Southeast, massive wildfires\u2014like those seen now in California\u2014could soon become a regular occurrence, smothering Atlanta and other cities in toxic smog, it warns. In New England and the mid-Atlantic, it says, oceanfront barrier islands could erode and narrow. And in the Midwest, it forecasts plunging yields of corn, soybeans, wheat, and rice. Read: The worst is yet to come for California\u2019s wildfires Its projections of sea-level rise are just as ominous. If carbon pollution continues to rise, a huge swath of the Atlantic coast\u2014from North Carolina to Maine\u2014will see sea-level rise of five feet by 2100. New Orleans, Houston, and the Gulf Coast could also face five feet of rising seas. Even Los Angeles and San Francisco could see the Pacific Ocean rise by three feet. Even if humanity were to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the report forecasts that New Orleans could still see five feet of sea-level rise by 2100. Andrew Light , another author of the report and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, said that although the report cannot make policy recommendations, it might be read as an endorsement of the Paris Agreement on climate change. \u201cIf the United States were to try and achieve the targets in the Paris Agreement, then things will be bad, but we can manage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t meet them, then we\u2019re talking about hundreds of thousands of lives every year that are at risk because of climate change. And hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201d If you think the Friday after Thanksgiving seems like an odd day to publish such a major report, you\u2019re right. The assessment was originally scheduled to be released in December at a large scientific conference in Washington, D.C. But earlier this week, officials announced that the report would come out two weeks early, on the afternoon of Black Friday. When politically inconvenient news is published in the final hours of a workweek, politicos call it a \u201c Friday news dump .\u201d Publishing a dire climate report in the final hours of Black Friday might be the biggest Friday news dump of them all. So who ordered such a dump? During a press conference on Friday, the report\u2019s directors in the government repeatedly declined to say. \u201cIt\u2019s out earlier than expected,\u201d said Monica Allen, a spokeswoman for NOAA. \u201cThis report has not been altered or revised in any way to reflect political considerations.\u201d Read: The global rightward shift on climate change Yet the change in scheduling took the report\u2019s authors by surprise. John Bruno, an author of the report and a coral biologist at the University of North Carolina, told me that he only learned last Friday that the report would be released today. \u201cThere was no explanation or justification,\u201d he said. \u201cThe [assessment] leadership implied the timing was being dictated by another entity, but did not say who that was.\u201d Hayhoe told me she only learned on Tuesday that the report would be released on Friday. At the time, she was preparing three pies for a family Thanksgiving. She put the pies aside and picked up her laptop\u00a0 to submit any final revisions to the document. The White House did not respond directly when asked who had ordered such a change. It also did not respond directly when asked if the report would lead President Trump to reconsider his beliefs. But a White House spokeswoman did send me a lengthy statement saying that \u201cthe United States leads the world in providing affordable, abundant, and secure energy to our citizens, while also leading the world in reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.\u201d (This is only true if you start counting in 2005, when U.S. emissions peaked .) The spokeswoman said this new assessment was based on the \u201cmost-extreme scenario,\u201d and promised any future report would have a \u201cmore transparent and data-driven process.\u201d Not that Hayhoe ever had high expectations about President Trump\u2019s reaction to the report. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the hope that the federal government would look at it and go, \u2018Oh my goodness! I see the light,\u2019 \u201d she told me. Rather, she said, she hoped the report would inform the public: \u201cThis isn\u2019t information that\u2019s only for the federal government. This is information that every city needs, every state needs, increasingly every business needs, and every homeowner needs. This is information that every human needs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that we care about a 1-degree increase in global temperature in the abstract,\u201d she said. \u201cWe care about water, we care about food, we care about the economy\u2014and every single one of those things is being affected by climate change today.\u201d","headline":"A Grave Climate Warning, Buried on Black Friday","article_name":576589.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/national-climate-assessment-black-friday\/576589\/","date_published":"2018-11-23 22:31:02","article_length":8665,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:40.557282","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/national-climate-assessment-black-friday\/576589\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"If carbon emissions continue to grow, anyone who works with the land could face \u2018unprecedented challenges.\u2019 If climate change continues unabated, nearly every ecosystem on the planet would alter dramatically, to the point of becoming an entirely new biome, according to a new paper written by 42 scientists from around the world. They warn that the changes of the next 200 years could equal\u2014and may likely exceed\u2014those seen over the 10,000 years that ended the last Ice Age. If humanity does not stop emitting greenhouse-gas emissions, the character of the land could metamorphose: Oak forest could become grassland. Evergreen woods could turn deciduous. And, of course, beaches would sink into the sea. \u201cAnywhere on the globe, the more you change climate, the more likely you are to see major ecological change,\u201d says Stephen Jackson , an author of the report and the director of a climate-adaptation center at the U.S. Geological Survey. \u201cHaving this kind of change occur at such a massive scale in such a short period of time is going to create unprecedented challenges for natural-resource management,\u201d he told me. The paper , published Thursday in Science , tries to find clues about the world of the future by examining the ecology of the past. Between the peak of the last Ice Age, about 20,000 years ago, and 1800 A.D. , the world warmed by between 4 and 7 degrees Celsius. This warming transfigured the landscape: It erased the mile-high plateau of ice that sat on Manhattan Island , for instance. By melting this and other continent-sized ice sheets, that ancient warming\u2014which was caused by minute shifts in the Earth\u2019s orbital path\u2014 raised global sea levels by almost 400 feet . If that sounds fun, it could happen again, within the lifetime of babies born today: Earth could experience 4 to 5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 if humanity does not slow the emission of heat-trapping gases. So what did that kind of shift look like that last time?\u00a0 Jackson and two of his colleagues\u2014Jonathan Overpeck and Connor Nolan\u2014addressed that question to dozens of researchers around the world. They asked them to consult what are called \u201cpaleoecological records\u201d: special objects in the Earth that have captured evidence of ecosystems over time. The mud at the bottom of a lake is a paleoecological record, for instance. Every year, plant pollen in the air falls into the lake, laying down minute layers as decades pass. Scientists can examine that pollen under the microscope\u2014identifying it, sometimes, to its individual species\u2014to piece together what an ecosystem looked like thousands of years ago . For this study, researchers looked at local paleoclimatic records from two windows of time: the height of the last Ice Age, 20,000 years ago; and the last moment, roughly 200 years ago, before modern global warming began. The world\u2019s most urgent science project Slowly, over years, those squadrons of researchers around the world sent back their data. A global picture began to take shape: nearly everywhere on Earth where the temperature changed dramatically, and the vegetation wholly transformed. Consider, for a second, the scale of these changes. Jackson asked me to think of the hot, humid, marshy plain of Washington, D.C. \u201cIf you took a walk through Rock Creek Park today, you\u2019d see almost entirely deciduous hardwood forest\u2014oak trees, and beech, and tulip poplar, and things like that,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut if you were to walk through Rock Creek Valley 20,000 years ago, you would be walking through boreal forest.\u201d It would resemble the forests in the far north of Quebec, the mighty evergreen stands of the Canadian Shield. It\u2019s the same story out west. \u201cFive miles from where I sit is the middle of the Sonoran Desert and Saguaro National Park,\u201d he told me, from his desk in Tuscon. \u201cToday, there\u2019s big saguaro cacti, mesquite trees, ironwood trees. If we were to roll back the calendar 20,000 years, and we went to the same place, we would find a woodland of evergreen trees.\u201d The same warming-induced changeovers of the land\u2014which transpired over at least five millennia the last time they struck\u2014are now happening again. \u201cOver the next 100 years, we could see temperature changes that are similar to that,\u201d says Connor Nolan , an ecologist at the University of Arizona and an author of the paper. Just how much would vegetation change worldwide? Nolan and his colleagues found a relationship in their bevy of worldwide records between how much temperatures rose and how significantly ecosystems change. When this relationship is projected forward, they find that Earth\u2019s entire land surface is more than 75 percent likely to switch over its biome entirely. Climate change means insects are coming for our food It\u2019s hard to state what that scale of change would mean for just about everyone who works with or depends on the land. \u201cIf you\u2019re a wildlife manager and your ecosystem changes, if you\u2019re a forest manager trying to respond to wildfires, if you\u2019re a water manager who is responsible for converting rainfall estimates into reservoir levels,\u201d Jackson warned, \u201cthen the old rules are not necessarily going to apply.\u201d Future changes may be even more dramatic than those predicted by the paper. That\u2019s because the climate of the past\u2014and the end of the last Ice Age\u2014cannot tell us everything about our future. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very crude analog,\u201d Jackson told me. \u201cThe future will not be like the past. Going into a greenhouse world will not be the same\u2014is not the same\u2014as going from the glacial world to the pre-industrial world.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s an instructive analog,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides another way of telling us\u2014beside the models and our limited array of ecological observations\u2014it tells us that terrestrial ecosystems are sensitive to temperature change.\u201d Outside scientists agreed. \u201cThe paper\u2019s findings are not surprising, but they are notable because of the approaches the authors took,\u201d said Margaret Frasier , an associate professor of ecology at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, in an email. Dorothy Peteet , a senior research scientist at NASA , told me that \u201cthe wild cards\u201d of modern climate change made it hard to know the shape of that future vegetation change. \u201cThe nonlinearity of drought and rainfall,\u201d as well as extensive wildfires or floods, \u201cmay affect vegetation greatly,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThese are notable effects of climate warming we are seeing today ... and they will probably be much more exacerbated in the future,\u201d she added.","headline":"No Ecosystem on Earth Is Safe From Climate Change","article_name":569038.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/how-climate-change-could-remake-every-biome-on-earth\/569038\/","date_published":"2018-08-30 18:00:11","article_length":6489,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:41.506578","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/how-climate-change-could-remake-every-biome-on-earth\/569038\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Environmentalists warn us that apocalypse awaits. Economists tell us that minimal fixes will get us through. Here's how we can move beyond the impasse.\u00a0 Not long ago, my newspaper informed me that glaciers in the western Antarctic, undermined by the warmer seas of a hotter world, were collapsing, and their disappearance \u201cnow appears to be unstoppable.\u201d The melting of these great ice sheets would make seas rise by at least four feet\u2014ultimately, possibly 12\u2014more than enough to flood cities from New York to Tokyo to Mumbai. Because I am interested in science, I read the two journal articles that had inspired the story. How much time do we have, I wondered, before catastrophe hits? One study, in Geophysical Research Letters , provided no guidance; the authors concluded only that the disappearing glaciers would \u201csignificantly contribute to sea level rise in decades to centuries to come.\u201d But the other, in Science , offered more-precise estimates: during the next century, the oceans will surge by as much as a quarter of a millimeter a year. By 2100, that is, the calamity in Antarctica will have driven up sea levels by almost an inch. The process would get a bit faster, the researchers emphasized, \u201cwithin centuries.\u201d How is one supposed to respond to this kind of news? On the one hand, the transformation of the Antarctic seems like an unfathomable disaster. On the other hand, the disaster will never affect me or anyone I know; nor, very probably, will it trouble my grandchildren. How much consideration do I owe the people it will affect, my 40-times-great-grandchildren, who, many climate researchers believe, will still be confronted by rising temperatures and seas? Americans don\u2019t even save for their own retirement! How can we worry about such distant, hypothetical beings? Worse, confronting climate change requires swearing off something that has been an extraordinary boon to humankind: cheap energy from fossil fuels. In the 3,600 years between 1800 B.C. and 1800 A.D. , the economic historian Gregory Clark has calculated, there was \u201cno sign of any improvement in material conditions\u201d in Europe and Asia. Then came the Industrial Revolution. Driven by the explosive energy of coal, oil, and natural gas, it inaugurated an unprecedented three-century wave of prosperity. Artificial lighting, air-conditioning, and automobiles, all powered by fossil fuels, swaddle us in our giddy modernity. In our ergonomic chairs and acoustical-panel cubicles, we sit cozy as kings atop 300 years of flaming carbon. In the best of times, this problem\u2014given its apocalyptic stakes, bewildering scale, and vast potential cost\u2014would be difficult to resolve. But we are not in the best of times. We are in a time of legislative paralysis. In an important step, the Obama administration announced in June its decision to cut power-plant emissions 30\u00a0percent by 2030. Otherwise, this country has seen strikingly little political action on climate change, despite three decades of increasingly high-pitched chatter by scientists, activists, economists, pundits, and legislators. The chatter itself, I would argue, has done its share to stall progress. Rhetorical overreach, moral miscalculation, shouting at cross-purposes: this toxic blend is particularly evident when activists, who want to scare Americans into taking action, come up against economists, with their cool calculations of acceptable costs. Eco-advocates insist that only the radical transformation of society\u2014the old order demolished, foundation to roof\u2014can fend off the worst consequences of climate change. Economists argue for adapting to the most-likely consequences; cheerleaders for industrial capitalism, they propose quite different, much milder policies, and are ready to let nature take a bigger hit in the short and long terms alike. Both envelop themselves in the mantle of Science, emitting a fug of charts and graphs. (Actually, every side in the debate, including the minority who deny that humans can affect the climate at all, claims the backing of Science.) Bewildered and battered by the back-and-forth, the citizenry sits, for the most part, on its hands. For all the hot air expended on the subject, we still don\u2019t know how to talk about climate change. As an issue, climate change was unlucky: when nonspecialists first became aware of it, in the 1990s, environmental attitudes had already become tribal political markers. As the Yale historian Paul Sabin makes clear in The Bet , it wasn\u2019t always this way. The votes for the 1970 Clean Air Act, for example, were 374\u20131 in the House, 73\u20130 in the Senate. Sabin\u2019s book takes off from a single event: a bet between the ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich and the economist Julian Simon a decade later. Ehrlich\u2019s The Population Bomb (1968), which decried humankind\u2019s rising numbers, was a foundational text in the environmental movement. Simon\u2019s Ultimate Resource (1981) was its antimatter equivalent: a celebration of population growth, it awakened opposition to the same movement. Ehrlich was moderately liberal in his politics but unrestrained in his rhetoric. The second sentence of The Population Bomb promised that \u201chundreds of millions of people\u201d would starve to death within two decades, no matter what \u201ccrash programs\u201d the world launched to feed them. A year later, Ehrlich gave even odds that \u201cEngland will not exist in the year 2000.\u201d In 1974, he told Congress that \u201ca billion or more people\u201d could starve in the 1980s \u201cat the latest.\u201d When the predictions didn\u2019t pan out, he attacked his critics as \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cignorant,\u201d \u201cmorons\u201d and \u201cidiots.\u201d Simon, who died in 1998, argued that \u201chuman resourcefulness and enterprise\u201d will extricate us from our ecological dilemma. Moderately conservative in his politics, he was exuberantly uninhibited in his scorn for eco-alarmists. Humankind faces no serious environmental problems, he asserted. \u201cAll long-run trends point in exactly the opposite direction from the projections of the doomsayers.\u201d ( All ? Really?) \u201cThere is no convincing economic reason why these trends toward a better life should not continue indefinitely.\u201d Relishing his role as a spoiler, he gave speeches while wearing red plastic devil horns. Unsurprisingly, he attracted disagreement, to which he responded with as much bluster as Ehrlich. Critics, motivated by \u201cblatant intellectual dishonesty\u201d and indifference to the poor, were \u201ccorrupt,\u201d their ideas \u201cignorant and wrongheaded.\u201d In 1980, the two men wagered $1,000 on the prices of five metals 10 years hence. If the prices rose, as Ehrlich predicted, it would imply that these resources were growing scarcer, as Homo sapiens plundered the planet. If the prices fell, this would be a sign that markets and human cleverness had made the metals relatively less scarce: progress was continuing. Prices dropped. Ehrlich paid up, insisting disingenuously that he had been \u201cschnookered.\u201d Schnookered, no; unlucky, yes. In 2010, three Holy Cross economists simulated the bet for every decade from 1900 to 2007. Ehrlich would have won 61\u00a0percent of the time. The results, Sabin says, do not prove that these resources have grown scarcer. Rather, metal prices crashed after the First World War and spent most of a century struggling back to their 1918 levels. Ecological issues were almost irrelevant. The bet demonstrated little about the environment but much about environmental politics. The American landscape first became a source of widespread anxiety at the beginning of the 20th century. Initially, the fretting came from conservatives, both the rural hunters who established the licensing system that brought back white-tailed deer from near-extinction and the Ivy League patricians who created the national parks. So ineradicable was the conservative taint that decades later, the left still scoffed at ecological issues as right-wing distractions. At the University of Michigan, the radical Students for a Democratic Society protested the first Earth Day, in 1970, as elitist flimflam meant to divert public attention from class struggle and the Vietnam War; the left-wing journalist I.\u00a0F.\u00a0Stone called the nationwide marches a \u201csnow job.\u201d By the 1980s, businesses had realized that environmental issues had a price tag. Increasingly, they balked. Reflexively, the anticorporate left pivoted; Earth Day, erstwhile snow job, became an opportunity to denounce capitalist greed. The result, as the Emory historian Patrick Allitt demonstrates in A Climate of Crisis , was a political back-and-forth that became ever less productive. Time and again, Allitt writes, activists and corporate executives railed against each other. Out of this clash emerged regulatory syntheses: rules for air, water, toxins. Often enough, businesspeople then discovered that following the new rules was less expensive than they had claimed it would be; environmentalists meanwhile found out that the problems were less dire than they had claimed. Throughout the 1980s, for instance, activists charged that acid rain from midwestern power-plant emissions was destroying thousands of East Coast lakes. Utilities insisted that anti-pollution equipment would be hugely expensive and make homeowners\u2019 electric bills balloon. One American Electric Power representative predicted that acid-rain control could lead to the \u201cdestruction of the Midwest economy.\u201d A 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, backed by both the Republican administration and the Democratic Congress, set up a cap-and-trade mechanism that reduced acid rain at a fraction of the predicted cost; electric bills were barely affected. Today, most scientists have concluded that the effects of acid rain were overstated to begin with\u2014fewer lakes were hurt than had been thought, and acid rain was not the only cause. Rather than learning from this and other examples that, as Allitt puts it, \u201cAmerica\u2019s environmental problems, though very real, were manageable,\u201d each side stored up bitterness, like batteries taking on charge. The process that had led, however disagreeably, to successful environmental action in the 1970s and \u201980s brought on political stasis in the \u201990s. Environmental issues became ways for politicians to signal their clan identity to supporters. As symbols, the issues couldn\u2019t be compromised. Standing up for your side telegraphed your commitment to take back America\u2014either from tyrannical liberal elitism or right-wing greed and fecklessness. Nothing got done. As an issue, climate change is perfect for symbolic battle, because it is as yet mostly invisible. Carbon dioxide, its main cause, is not emitted in billowing black clouds, like other pollutants; nor is it caustic, smelly, or poisonous. A side effect of modernity, it has for now a tiny practical impact on most people\u2019s lives. To be sure, I remember winters as being colder in my childhood, but I also remember my home then as a vast castle and my parents as godlike beings. In concrete terms, Americans encounter climate change mainly in the form of three graphs, staples of environmental articles. The first shows that atmospheric carbon dioxide has been steadily increasing. Almost nobody disputes this. The second graph shows rising global temperatures. This measurement is trickier: carbon dioxide is spread uniformly in the air, but temperatures are affected by a host of factors (clouds, rain, wind, altitude, the reflectivity of the ground) that differ greatly from place to place. Here the data are more subject to disagreement. A few critics argue that for the past 17 years warming has mostly stopped. Still, most scientists believe that in the past century the Earth\u2019s average temperature has gone up by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Rising temperatures per se are not the primary concern. What matters most is their future influence on other things: agricultural productivity, sea levels, storm frequency, infectious disease. As the philosopher Dale Jamieson points out in the unfortunately titled Reason in a Dark Time , most of these effects cannot be determined by traditional scientific experiments\u2014white-coats in laboratories can\u2019t melt a spare Arctic ice cap to see what happens. (Climate change has no lab rats.) Instead, thousands of researchers refine ever bigger and more complex mathematical models. The third graph typically shows the consequences such models predict, ranging from worrisome (mainly) to catastrophic (possibly). Such charts are meaningful to the climatologists who make them. But for the typical citizen they are a muddle, too abstract\u2014too much like 10th-grade homework\u2014to be convincing, let alone to motivate action. In the history of our species, has any human heart ever been profoundly stirred by a graph? Some other approach, proselytizers have recognized, is needed. To stoke concern, eco-campaigners like Bill McKibben still resort, Ehrlich-style, to waving a skeleton at the reader. Thus the first sentence of McKibben\u2019s Oil and Honey , a memoir of his climate activism, describes 2011\u201312, the period covered by his book, as \u201ca time when the planet began to come apart.\u201d Already visible \u201cin almost every corner of the earth,\u201d climate \u201cchaos\u201d is inducing \u201can endless chain of disasters that will turn civilization into a never-ending emergency response drill.\u201d The only solution to our ecological woes, McKibben argues, is to live simpler, more local, less resource-intensive existences\u2014something he believes is already occurring. \u201cAfter a long era of getting big and distant,\u201d he writes, \u201cour economy, and maybe our culture, has started to make a halting turn toward the small and local.\u201d Not only will this shift let us avoid the worst consequences of climate change, it will have the happy side effect of turning a lot of unpleasant multinational corporations to ash. As we \u201csubside into a workable, even beautiful, civilization,\u201d we will lead better lives. No longer hypnotized by the buzz and pop of consumer culture, narcotized couch potatoes will be transformed into robust, active citizens: spiritually engaged, connected to communities, appreciative of Earth\u2019s abundance. For McKibben, the engagement is full throttle: The Oil half of his memoir is about founding 350.org, a group that seeks to create a mass movement against climate change. (The 350 refers to the theoretical maximum safe level, in parts per million, of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a level we have already surpassed.) The Honey half is about buying 70 acres near his Vermont home to support an off-the-grid beekeeper named Kirk Webster, who is living out McKibben\u2019s organic dream in a handcrafted, solar-powered cabin in the woods. Webster, McKibben believes, is the future. We must, he says, \u201cstart producing a nation of careful, small-scale farmers such as Kirk Webster, who can adapt to the crazed new world with care and grace, and who don\u2019t do much more damage in the process.\u201d Poppycock, the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner in effect replies in The Fanaticism of the Apocalypse . A best-selling, telegenic public intellectual (a species that hardly exists in this country), Bruckner is mainly going after what he calls \u201cecologism,\u201d of which McKibbenites are exemplars. At base, he says, ecologism seeks not to save nature but to purify humankind through self-flagellating asceticism. To Bruckner, ecologism is both ethnocentric and counterproductive. Ethnocentric because eco-denunciations of capitalism simply give new, green garb to the long-standing Euro-American fear of losing dominance over the developing world (whose recent growth derives, irksomely, from fossil fuels). Counterproductive because ecologism induces indifference, or even hostility to environmental issues. In the quest to force humanity into a puritanical straitjacket of rural simplicity, ecologism employs what should be neutral, fact-based descriptions of a real-world problem (too much carbon dioxide raises temperatures) as bludgeons to compel people to accept modes of existence they would otherwise reject. Intuiting moral blackmail underlying the apparently objective charts and graphs, Bruckner argues, people react with suspicion, skepticism, and sighing apathy\u2014the opposite of the reaction McKibbenites hope to evoke. The ranchers and farmers in Tony Horwitz\u2019s Boom , a deft and sometimes sobering e-book, suggest Bruckner may be on to something. Horwitz, possibly best known for his study of Civil War reenactors, Confederates in the Attic , travels along the proposed path of the Keystone\u00a0XL, a controversial pipeline intended to take oil from Alberta\u2019s tar-sands complex to refineries in Steele City, Nebraska\u2014and the project McKibben has used as the rallying cry for 350.org. McKibben set off on his anti-Keystone crusade after the climatologist-provocateur James Hansen charged in 2011 that building the pipeline would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate. If Keystone were built, Hansen later wrote, \u201ccivilization would be at risk.\u201d Everyone Horwitz meets has heard this scenario. But nobody seems to have much appetite for giving up the perks of industrial civilization, Kirk Webster\u2013style. \u201cYou want to go back to the Stone Age and use only wind, sun, and water?\u201d one person asks. A truck driver in the tar-sands project tells Horwitz, \u201cThis industry is giving me a future, even if it\u2019s a short one and we\u2019re all about to toast together.\u201d Given the scale of the forces involved, individual action seems futile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to burn up anyhow at the end,\u201d explains a Hutterite farmer, matter-of-factly. \u201cThe world will end in fire.\u201d Nordhaus provides graphs (!) showing how a gradually increasing tax\u2014or, possibly, a market in emissions permits\u2014would slowly and steadily ratchet down global carbon-dioxide output. The problem, as he admits, is that the projected reduction \u201cassumes full participation.\u201d Translated from econo-speak, \u201cfull participation\u201d means that the Earth\u2019s rich and populous nations must simultaneously apply the tax. Brazil, China, France, India, Russia, the United States\u2014all must move in concert, globally cooperating. Alas, nothing like Nordhaus\u2019s planetary carbon tax has ever been enacted. The sole precedent is the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty banning substances that react with atmospheric ozone and reduce its ability to absorb the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Signed by every United Nations member and successfully updated 10 times, the protocol is a model of international eco-cooperation. But it involves outlawing chemicals in refrigerators and spray cans, not asking nations to revamp the base of their own prosperity. Nordhaus\u2019s declaration that a global carbon tax is a simple answer is like arguing that the simple answer to death is repealing the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Does climate change, as Nordhaus claims, truly slip into the silk glove of standard economic thought? The dispute is at the center of Jamieson\u2019s Reason in a Dark Time . Parsing logic with the care of a raccoon washing a shiny stone, Jamieson maintains that economists\u2019 discussions of climate change are almost as problematic as those of environmentalists and politicians, though for different reasons. Remember how I was complaining that all discussions of climate change devolve into homework? Here, sadly, is proof. To critique economists\u2019 claims, Jamieson must drag the reader through the mucky assumptions underlying cost-benefit analysis, a standard economic tool. In the case of climate change, the costs of cutting carbon dioxide are high. What are the benefits? If the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises only slightly above its current 400 parts per million, most climatologists believe, there is (roughly) a 90\u00a0percent chance that global temperatures will eventually rise between 3 and 8\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit, with the most likely jump being between 4 and 5\u00a0degrees. Nordhaus and most other economists conclude that humankind can slowly constrain this relatively modest rise in carbon without taking extraordinary, society-transforming measures, though neither decreasing the use of fossil fuels nor offsetting their emissions will be cheap or easy. But the same estimates show (again in rough terms) a 5\u00a0percent chance that letting carbon dioxide rise much above its current level would set off a domino-style reaction leading to global devastation. (No one pays much attention to the remaining 5\u00a0percent chance that the carbon rise would have very little effect on temperature.) In our daily lives, we typically focus on the most likely result: I decide whether to jaywalk without considering the chance that I will trip in the street and get run over. But sometimes we focus on the extreme: I lock up my gun and hide the bullets in a separate place to minimize the chance that my kids will find and play with them. For climate change, should we focus on adapting to the most probable outcome or averting the most dangerous one? Cost-benefit analyses typically ignore the most-radical outcomes: they assume that society has agreed to accept the small but real risk of catastrophe\u2014something environmentalists, to take one particularly vehement section of society, have by no means done. On top of this, Jamieson argues, there is a second problem in the models economists use to discus climate change. Because the payoff from carbon-dioxide reduction will occur many decades from now, Nordhausian analysis suggests that we should do the bare minimum today, even if that means saddling our descendants with a warmer world. Doing the minimum is expensive enough already, economists say. Because people tomorrow will be richer than we are, as we are richer than our grandparents were, they will be better able to pay to clean up our emissions. Unfortunately, this is an ethically problematic stance. How can we weigh the interests of someone born in 2050 against those of someone born in 1950? In this kind of trade-off between generations, Jamieson argues, \u201cthere is no plausible value\u201d for how much we owe the future. Given their moral problems, he concludes, economic models are much less useful as guides than their proponents believe. For all their ostensible practicality\u2014for all their attempts to skirt the paralysis-inducing specter of the apocalypse\u2014economists, too, don\u2019t have a good way to talk about climate change. Years ago, a colleague and I spoke with the physicist Richard Feynman, later a national symbol of puckish wit and brash truth-telling. At the frontiers of science, he told us, hosts of unclear, mutually contradictory ideas are always swarming about. Researchers can never agree on how to proceed or even on what is important. In these circumstances, Feynman said, he always tried to figure out what would take him forward no matter which theory eventually turned out to be correct. In this agnostic spirit, let\u2019s assume that rising carbon-dioxide levels will become a problem of some magnitude at some time and that we will want to do something practical about it. Is there something we should do, no matter what technical arcanae underlie the cost-benefit analyses, no matter when we guess the bad effects from climate change will kick in, no matter how we value future generations, no matter what we think of global capitalism? Indeed, is there some course of action that makes sense even if we think that climate change isn\u2019t much of a problem at all? As my high-school math teacher used to say, let\u2019s do the numbers. Roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels, and roughly three-quarters of that comes from just two sources: coal in its various forms, and oil in its various forms, including gasoline. Different studies produce slightly different estimates, but they all agree that coal is responsible for more carbon dioxide than oil is\u2014about 25\u00a0percent more. That number is likely to increase, because coal consumption is growing much faster than oil consumption. Although coal and oil are both fossil fuels, they are used differently. In this country, for example, the great majority of oil\u2014about three-quarters\u2014is consumed by individuals, as they heat their homes and drive their cars. Almost all U.S. coal (93\u00a0percent) is burned not in homes but by electric-power plants; the rest is mainly used by industry, notably for making cement and steel. Cutting oil use, in other words, requires huge numbers of people to change their houses and automobiles\u2014the United States alone has 254\u00a0million vehicles on the road. Reducing U.S. coal emissions, by contrast, means regulating 557 big power plants and 227 steel and cement factories. (Surprisingly, many smaller coal plants exist, some at hospitals and schools, but their contributions are negligible.) I\u2019ve been whacking poor old Nordhaus for his ideas about who should pay for climate change, but he does make this point, and precisely: \u201cThe most cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions is to reduce the use of coal first and most sharply.\u201d Note, too, that this policy comes with a public-health bonus: reining in coal pollution could ultimately avoid as many as 6,600 premature deaths and 150,000 children\u2019s asthma attacks per year in the United States alone. Different nations have different arrangements, but almost everywhere the basic point holds true: a relatively small number of industrial coal plants\u2014perhaps 7,000 worldwide\u2014put out an amazingly large amount of carbon dioxide, more than 40\u00a0percent of the global total. And that figure is rising; last year, coal\u2019s share of energy production hit a 44-year high, because Asian nations are building coal plants at a fantastic rate (and, possibly, because demand for coal-fired electricity will soar as electric cars become popular). No matter what your views about the impact and import of climate change, you are primarily talking about coal. To my mind, at least, retrofitting 7,000 industrial facilities, however mind-boggling, is less mind-boggling than, say, transforming the United States into \u201ca nation of careful, small-scale farmers\u201d or enacting a global carbon tax with \u201cfull participation.\u201d It is, at least, imaginable. The focus of the Obama administration on reducing coal emissions suggests that it has followed this logic. If the pattern of the late 20th century still held, industry would reply with exaggerated estimates of the cost, and compromises would be worked out. But because the environment has become a proxy for a tribal battle, an exercise in power politics will surely ensue. I\u2019ve given McKibben grief for his apocalyptic rhetoric, but he\u2019s exactly correct that without a push from a popular movement\u2014without something like 350.org\u2014meaningful attempts to cut back coal emissions are much less likely to yield results. Regrettably, 350.org has fixated on the Keystone pipeline, which the Congressional Research Service has calculated would raise this nation\u2019s annual output of greenhouse gases by 0.05 to 0.3\u00a0percent. (James Hansen, in arguing that the pipeline would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate, erroneously assumed that all of the tar-sands oil could be burned rapidly, instead of dribbling out in relatively small portions year by year, over decades.) None of this is to say that exploiting tar sands is a good idea, especially given the apparent violation of native treaties in Canada. But a popular movement focused on symbolic goals will have little ability to win practical battles in Washington. If politics fail, the only recourse, says David Keith, a Harvard professor of public policy and applied physics, will be a technical fix. And soon\u2014by mid-century. Keith is talking about geo-engineering: fighting climate change with more climate change. A Case for Climate Engineering is a short book arguing that we should study spraying the stratosphere with tiny glittering droplets of sulfuric acid that bounce sunlight back into space, reducing the Earth\u2019s temperature. Physically speaking, the notion is feasible. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines, created huge amounts of airborne sulfuric acid\u2014and lowered the Earth\u2019s average temperature that year by about 1\u00a0degree. Keith is candid about the drawbacks. Not only does geo-engineering involve tinkering with planetary systems we only partially understand, it can\u2019t cancel out, even in theory, greenhouse problems like altered rainfall patterns and increased ocean acidity. The sulfur would soon fall to the Earth, a toxic rain of pollution that could kill thousands of people every year. The carbon dioxide that was already in the air would remain. To continue to slow warming, sulfur would have to be lofted anew every year. Still, Keith points out, without this relatively crude repair, unimpeded climate change could be yet more deadly. Planet-hacking does have an overarching advantage: it\u2019s cheap. \u201cThe cost of geoengineering the entire planet for a decade,\u201d Keith writes, \u201ccould be less than the $6\u00a0billion the Italian government is spending on dikes and movable barriers to protect a single city, Venice, from climate change\u2013related sea level rise.\u201d That advantage is also dangerous, he points out. A single country could geo-engineer the whole planet by itself. Or one country\u2019s geo-engineering could set off conflicts with another country\u2014a Chinese program to increase its monsoon might reduce India\u2019s monsoon. \u201cBoth are nuclear weapons states,\u201d Keith reminds us. According to Forbes , the world has 1,645 billionaires, several hundred of them in nations threatened by climate change. If their businesses or homes were at risk, any one of them could single-handedly pay for a course of geo-engineering. Is anyone certain none of these people would pull the trigger? Few experts think that relying on geo-engineering would be a good idea. But no one knows how soon reality will trump ideology, and so we may finally have hit on a useful form of alarmism. One of the virtues of Keith\u2019s succinct, scary book is to convince the reader that unless we find a way to talk about climate change, planes full of sulfuric acid will soon be on the runway.","headline":"How to Talk About Climate Change So People Will Listen","article_name":375067.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2014\/09\/how-to-talk-about-climate-change-so-people-will-listen\/375067\/","date_published":"2014-08-14 00:09:44","article_length":29965,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:41.594658","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2014\/09\/how-to-talk-about-climate-change-so-people-will-listen\/375067\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Rising sea levels will force the Kuna off of their 365 Panamanian islands within the next generation One of the traditional songs performed by the sahilas , or wise elders of Kuna Yala, compares their tribe's 365 tiny Caribbean islands, which are legally part of Panama but afforded a degree of autonomy, to \"coconuts resting firmly on the sand\" that will never disappear, regardless of the strong winds or high tides. In late 2008, after a series of giant waves flooded most of the islands, the sahilas began singing a new song. \"Why are our mothers crying? It is because of the hurricanes and earthquakes,\" the lyrics go. \"Times are getting dark. Who is causing this?\" The storms that pummeled the islands for 14 straight days that October compounded the four-inch sea level rise since 2004, ruining schools, subsistence crops, and wood and straw homes. But the episode had a more lasting impact: The Kuna now fear that they will be permanently flooded off of the islands they've called home for several hundred years, forced to relocate their population of 45,000 to the only other land in their territory--the mainland forest. One year after the floods, my husband and I boarded a small prop plane from Panama City to Usdup, which with about 5,000 people is the most populous Kuna island. We arrived without plans for where to stay, so Toyo, a young Kuna man who worked for the airline, ushered us inside a cayuco , or dugout canoe, and kindly took us half-way around the island to the village's only hotel. There are no cars or motorcycles allowed on Usdup. Women mostly spend their days within the network of huts and courtyards, cooking, caring for their kids, and embroidering molas - the traditional dress of layered colorful fabrics that has drawn tourists and anthropologists here for years. When the men aren't at home swinging in their hammocks, they head out to the sea in their cayucos to fish or across the bay to the forest and mountains to look for food. \"Everyone here makes a living from nature, and each family has a small parcel on the mainland where they can grow coconuts, manioc, cocoa, yucca, corn and bananas,\" said Toyo. \"I've lost the custom of heading out each morning to harvest, but when I was a kid, I would always go in the cayuco to help my father.\" Despite a few modern-day distractions and comforts - cell phones are omnipresent - most residents of Kuna Yala still live simple and traditional lives. But over the past decade, the Kuna's sacred forest, called bonigana, and their islands have come under serious threat from climate change. As climate scientists have long warned, climate change is causing sea levels to rise around the globe. Recent studies by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) report that, since 1910, the average sea level in Kuna Yala has risen by almost 6 inches and is now increasing by around 3\/4 of an inch each year. The islands don't rise much above sea level, and it isn't difficult to guess how many years it would take before they are under water if the trend continues unabated. A conservative estimate by STRI gives them less than 50 years. In the meantime, communities have resorted to landfill, made of gravel from nearby riverbeds and coral reefs, to keep the sea at bay. The rising sea will likely force most Kuna communities to move to the mainland within a generation. \"Many experts have come to Kuna Yala to suggest that we move to the mainland, and into the forest,\" said Toyo one day, as we stood on the edge of Usdup, facing a row of mangroves on the edge of the mainland. \"But can you imagine how difficult that would be? And how would we pay for it?\" The Panamanian government has discussed the need to help the Kuna with the transition in the next 10 to 15 years, but has not yet determined how to do it or what it would cost. The Kuna Yala's land was not easily won. After a violent rebellion in 1925, followed by years of negotiation with the Panamanian government that became so heated the U.S. had to intervene, the Kuna secured both self-governance and full voting rights as Panamanians. This arrangement, which remains today, gives the Kuna one of the greatest degrees of self-rule of any indigenous group in Latin America. Over the last 30 years, the Kuna have successfully fought infrastructure projects from government-granted mining concessions to plans to build a major highway. A recent proposal to pass a power line through Kuna territory has been a subject of heavy debate. After having fought so hard for their islands, many Kuna are disinclined to leave. \"If our territory came under threat once again, for any reason, I would take up arms to defend it,\" an otherwise gentle 70 year-old man named Feliciano Jones told us. \"The main thing we share as Kuna, is that we don't take for granted what our ancestors did for us.\" But that has not stopped Kuna leaders from discussing the floods and rising sea level. While there is no Kuna word for climate change, the Spanish cambio clim\u00e1tico can be heard frequently on the islands, often as part of discussions about the impending move. On our last evening in Udsup, as we sat alongside a congregation that had gathered inside to listen to the sahilas' hypnotic, circular chants and predictions for the future, another tropical downpour began. Lightning and thunder followed. Outside, the dirt paths quickly turned to mud and soon flooded. We could make out the noise of people running and splashing around, looking for cover. This story was produced in association with the media NGO Project Word as part of coverage of a UN climate mitigation program in Panama. It was made possible by a grant from The Christensen Fund. .

{"id":null,"body":"In the middle of a weird weather week, the EPA quietly published one of its first significant climate proposals. Warming reality notwithstanding, we're entering a ferocious new era of Washington climate brawls. In the middle of a week marked by weird weather, the EPA quietly published one of the first significant proposals to substantially regulate coal consumption. Quietly for now , anyway. Warming reality notwithstanding, we're entering a ferocious new era of Washington climate brawls. The EPA's process for creating a new rule is the opposite of that. It's typically slow, deliberative. A proposal is published, feedback is submitted, the rule is refined \u2014\u00a0eventually, it becomes a mandate. The proposed new rule, published on Wednesday, really just hit the starting line, a little less than seven months after President Obama gave a dramatic, sweat-soaked speech pledging new action on climate change . What the rule would do is tackle a subset of a subset of greenhouse gas production, regulating the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted at a new coal power plant. It would require, if enacted, that any new facilities being built incorporate \"carbon-capture\" technology \u2014\u00a0a system that would prevent most of the carbon dioxide that's produced from burning coal from escaping into the air. (In an interesting reversal, Republicans, who once hailed carbon capture as a climate change solution, now point out that such systems are too immature to be implemented.) It's urgently needed. Thanks to a century-plus during which not such constraints on coal burning existed, carbon dioxide (often just called carbon) is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. In 2011, one-third of all of the greenhouse gas produced in the U.S. came from electricity production . To slow global warming, you have to slow carbon dioxide emission at power plants. It's a simple calculus. What the new rule doesn't do, though, is regulate emissions at existing plants, the sites that contribute nearly all of our current carbon pollution. A rule regulating those facilities is coming at some point, having become inevitable once the Supreme Court told the Bush administration in 2007 that delays in addressing the issue were unacceptable. In his June speech, Obama promised that it would be handled by the end of his second term. And that's the fight that looms. As the 2007 to 2014 gap illustrates, Obama hasn't exactly moved quickly on the issue of coal-burning himself. That's largely because the issue is extremely touchy politically. As the 2012 campaign approached, Mitt Romney increasingly appealed to Appalachian states (most importantly, Ohio) by critiquing the president's then-non-existent \"war on coal.\" Obama wants to end coal use, the argument went, but Obama's regulation-light first term blunted the line pretty effectively. It didn't resonate in Ohio, but certainly contributed to Obama's poor showing in West Virginia (among other factors). The state's relatively small but culturally significant coal industry holds enormous sway in its consciousness. In his second inaugural speech last January, Obama demanded that Congress, at last, come up with legislation to curb coal use, pledging to finally launch that war on coal if nothing was done. Congress did nothing. Nor will it. In his rambling climate-change-is-fake-because-it's-cold speech from the Senate floor earlier this week, Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe went out of his way to bash cap-and-trade, a system of carbon regulation that died on Capitol Hill two Congresses ago. It's so dead that no serious consideration of it has been made since. Which leaves Obama in a particularly tricky position. One of the prominent new lines of attack against his presidency is his reliance on regulatory action to address problems he considers urgent: gun control, the environment at large, health care where possible. In December, that independence contributed to Republican charges that Obama was usurping the Constitution , leading to an \"I don't want to say the word 'impeachment,' but\"-style hearing. As the EPA's proposed rule moves forward and receives feedback, that argument will accelerate. House Republicans have already pledged that one of their first priorities in 2014 will be reining in the EPA , focusing on smaller-scale rules on waste disposal and hazardous substances. When the coal-plant rule gets closer, it will offer a new point of tension between the White House and Republicans \u2014\u00a0and as discussion over the much, much more contentious issue of existing plants begins, the fight will become severe. The issue of the threat to coal jobs will put a human face on the dispute. From The Hill 's report on the new EPA proposal: It's not quite as simple as \"regulate coal, jobs go away.\" America still exports a vast amount of coal to other countries, including a mature infrastructure that moves coal from Barrasso's Wyoming to the West Coast to Asia. But as the chart at right shows, the coal industry's problems go far beyond new environmental regulations. While overall production has stayed fairly consistent for some time \u2014\u00a02008 saw a high in production that stumbled in the recession \u2014\u00a0production per man-hour has dropped steeply since 2000. Seams of quality coal found near the surface of the Earth aren't as abundant as they once were. The constraints of availability necessarily means that fossil fuel production will become more costly over time, even without any government regulation. But that's a tough argument to make when Congressional Republicans (who would like to be reelected) have a ready foil in a president who thinks we burn too much coal. Meanwhile, the world gets weirder: a polar vortex that the White House, at least, suggests may be climate change-linked , 120-plus degrees in Australia. The debate on climate change at large is settled, as is the proper policy solution. But in America, with that first little step on a partial carbon regulation, the fight is about to get underway.","headline":"The Political War Over Climate Change Is About to Heat Up","article_name":356887.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/01\/political-war-over-climate-change-about-heat\/356887\/","date_published":"2014-01-10 15:19:00","article_length":5996,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:43.186862","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/01\/political-war-over-climate-change-about-heat\/356887\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A bleak report released by the UN's IPCC makes several things clear: climate change is well underway, it will affect food supplies and global stability, and politicians \u2014\u00a0particularly American ones \u2014\u00a0should be embarrassed at their inaction. A bleak report released by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the fifth in a series, makes several things clear: climate change is well underway, it will affect food supplies and global stability, and politicians \u2014\u00a0particularly American ones \u2014\u00a0should be embarrassed at their inaction. To be fair, that last point is subtextual, an unavoidable conclusion from the worst parts of the report. It's hard not to see that the ongoing failure to address climate change is the biggest geopolitical misstep of the last 80 years. The New York Times  has the best summary : \"ice caps are melting, sea ice in the Arctic is collapsing, water supplies are coming under stress, heat waves and heavy rains are intensifying, coral reefs are dying, and fish and many other creatures are migrating toward the poles or in some cases going extinct.\" Also: crop growing patterns are being disrupted, threatening the food supply. Oceans are rising, thanks to warmer sea temperatures and melting ice. They're growing more acidic thanks to increased CO 2 absorption, which can dissolve the shells of shellfish. The thawing permafrost means more organic material is decomposing, releasing even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These things are happening currently , on \"all continents and across the oceans.\" The effects of climate change \u2014\u00a0the climate change that is already happening \u2014\u00a0will be disproportionately felt by the global poor, as the Guardian reports . In part, that's because the areas that will experience severe weather and flooding are disproportionately poor (see the Times ' series on Bangladesh ). The poor are already more likely to be on the tipping point already, meaning that displacement due to flooding or a lack of readily available food. And they are more likely to live in politically unstable areas. \"[C]hanges to the Earth's climate are fuelling violent conflicts,\" the Guardian writes. \"The UN for the first time in this report has designated climate change a threat to human security.\" See: Darfur . \"Large magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and challenging impacts,\" the report states. But those large magnitudes of warming are avoidable. For the most tangible effect of climate change, increased warming, the report maps two warming scenarios. The map at left shows how temperatures will increase by the end of the century under the low-end \"representative concentration pathway\" \u2014\u00a0that is, an estimate of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at that point that is the lowest the ICPP considered. At right, the high-end estimate. The axis at left shows CO 2 concentrations; right now, the level is hovering around 400. What do those two paths look like in practice? The graph at right, from Wikipedia summarizes the IPCC analysis . The low-end estimate assumes that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere peak near 450 parts-per-million and decline beginning at the middle of the century. The high-end estimate assumes that the concentration of emissions continues unabated. Climate change is happening. The question is how bad we allow it to become. As ThinkProgress' Joe Romm\u00a0 points out , the IPCC assessment offers a conservative estimate of what to expect, only assuming that warming will hit 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit over time. That will help make the case to world leaders that the report is not some bizarre, extreme environmentalist rant; rather, it's a thoughtful, sober assessment of what's to come and what can be avoided. Perhaps the most powerful chart in the report (the lengthy introduction of which is here ) is the one below. It shows three eras: climate change in the present, the era of change to which our current emissions have committed us (lasting the next 25 years or so), and the era that we can still affect. The question is whether or not we will sidestep that third stage, with its multiple adverse effects. So far, there's been little indication that we will.\u00a0 The political challenge of climate change is not that world leaders don't accept that it's happening, it's that there's little impetus to actually act on it. Leaders in countries that will be disproportionately and immediately affected by climate change are largely not the countries responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that have caused the problem, as The Wire noted last week. Countries that are the heaviest polluters \u2014\u00a0the United States, China, and the European Union, in particular \u2014\u00a0see little short-term economic benefit in curbing that pollution. The difference between the global reaction to the hole in ozone layer, which went from an observed problem in 1985 to an international solution in 1987 , was threefold. First, the producers of CFCs, the chemical responsible for the hole, didn't have enormous economic clout. Second, they could quickly switch CFCs with substitutes. And, third, the national economy didn't rely on CFCs to operate. The number one creator of greenhouse gas pollution in developed countries is burning coal for the production of electricity. As more countries enter the global middle class, that problem continues to grow, with 1,200 new coal plants planned in 59 countries over the short-term. That's a path that will lead to the worst-case CO 2 projections, not the best. The United States could have taken an active role in curbing coal-burning and greenhouse gas emissions. It could have exercised its international economic power to encourage a global transition away from burning coal. It could have quickly set new emissions standards for coal-burning power plants \u2014\u00a0something mandated by the Supreme Court under George W. Bush and still not finalized for existing power plants even today. But the American democratic process failed on this. \"Politically speaking, it\u2019s always easier to shell out money for a disaster that has already happened, with clearly identifiable victims,\" The New Yorker 's James Surowiecki wrote after Sandy, \"than to invest money in protecting against something that may or may not happen in the future.\" So no action has been taken. The IPCC report is its fifth. The first came out in 1990; a second, reflecting updated science, in 1995. Another in 2001, another in 2007. The most recent iteration is simply the most bleak, the most updated predictions of how bad it will get. Will this be the one that prompts the United States Congress to move to action, to change our country's policies to try and stay on that lower emissions path while using our international power to change the behavior of other countries? No. It probably will not. It\u2019s always easier to shell out money for a disaster that has already happened.

CBC News  reports : North Vancouver, B.C., is believed to be the first city in the world to make climate-change warning labels mandatory on gas pumps. The city council passed the bylaw unanimously in a vote on Monday night. \u2026 North Vancouver Mayor Darrell Mussatto said the city hopes to implement the stickers by early next year and will make it mandatory for pumps to have them as part of a business license. \u201cThe message is that burning fossil fuels causes climate change and ... to add a positive spin, here are some tips when using your automobile on how to make it more fuel efficient,\u201d he said. It\u2019s unclear what the labels will look like. The city council is considering designs that \u201cdeliver key messages or \u2018prompts\u2019 as reminders of positive, can-do actions people can take to reduce GHG emissions.\u201d These might be suggestions like buying an electric vehicle, trading in an old car for a $1,360 transit pass, and saving fuel by keeping tires properly inflated. There might also be facts about greenhouse gases, such as \u201cBurning fossil fuel contributes to climate change\u201d or \u201c49 percent of GHG emissions in the City of North Vancouver are from transportation.\u201d The latter approach is closer to the vision of Robert Shirkey, whose environmental group Our Horizon pushed hard for the labels. Concepts drawn up by Our Horizon are a bit more in-your-face about drivers\u2019 personal responsibility, proposing images like a sad, presumably unhealthy child: And imperiled northern animals: In a CityLab interview earlier this year, Shirkey explained he wanted these images to \u201cprime\u201d motorists into associating fuel with danger, in the same way a photo of diseased lungs on cigarette packs might make a smokers think twice about their habits: \u201cResearch from the tobacco realm shows that labels with images have more of an impact than text-only labels,\u201d says Robert Shirkey. \u2026 \u201cThe priming aspect is also useful in that it can help to shape how the product is perceived after the labels are implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cIf fossil fuels are thought of in similar ways as we think of cigarettes, you\u2019re creating a social environment that gives government much more space to address the issue.\u201d North Vancouver\u2019s council\u2014which voted unanimously for the bylaw\u2014will now review designs for the first batch of labels, which are expected to cost around $2,260 (in U.S. dollars).

In his offices overlooking Lake Washington, just east of Seattle, Bill Gates grabbed a legal pad recently and began covering it in his left-handed scrawl.

Gates thinks that we can\u2019t accept this outcome, and that our best chance to vault over natural gas to a globally applicable, carbon-free source of energy is to drive innovation \u201cat an unnaturally high pace.\u201d When I sat down to hear his case a few weeks ago, he didn\u2019t evince much patience for the argument that American politicians couldn\u2019t agree even on whether climate change is real, much less on how to combat it. \u201cIf you\u2019re not bringing math skills to the problem,\u201d he said with a sort of amused asperity, \u201cthen representative democracy is a problem.\u201d What follows is a condensed transcript of his remarks, lightly edited for clarity. On whether new commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions expected at the United Nations climate-change conference in Paris in December mean the world is now serious about the problem: It\u2019s good to have people making commitments. It\u2019s really good. But if you really look at those commitments\u2014which are not binding, but even if you say they will all be achieved\u2014they fall dramatically short of the reductions required to reduce CO2 emissions enough to prevent a scenario where global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius. I mean, these commitments won\u2019t even be a third of what you need. And one of the interesting things about this problem is, if you have a country that says, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to get on a pathway for an 80 percent reduction in CO2 by 2050,\u201d it might make a commitment that \u201cHey, by 2030, we\u2019ll be at 30 percent reduction.\u201d But that first 30 percent is dramatically, dramatically easier than getting to 80 percent. So everything that\u2019s hard has been saved for post-2030\u2014and even these 2030 commitments aren\u2019t enough. And many of them won\u2019t be achieved. On why the free market won\u2019t develop new forms of energy fast enough: Well, there\u2019s no fortune to be made. Even if you have a new energy source that costs the same as today\u2019s and emits no CO2, it will be uncertain compared with what\u2019s tried-and-true and already operating at unbelievable scale and has gotten through all the regulatory problems, like \u201cOkay, what do you do with coal ash?\u201d and \u201cHow do you guarantee something is safe?\u201d Without a substantial carbon tax, there\u2019s no incentive for innovators or plant buyers to switch. And for energy as a whole, the incentive to invest is quite limited, because unlike digital products\u2014where you get very rapid adoption and so, within the period that your trade secret stays secret or your patent gives you a 20-year exclusive, you can reap incredible returns\u2014almost everything that\u2019s been invented in energy was invented more than 20 years before it got scaled usage. So if you go back to various energy innovators, actually, they didn\u2019t do that well financially. The rewards to society of these energy advances\u2014not much of that is captured by the individual innovator, because it\u2019s a very conservative market. So the R&D amount in energy is surprisingly low compared with medicine or digital stuff, where both the government spending and the private-sector spending is huge. On the pace of energy transitions historically: What\u2019s amazing is how our intense energy usage is one and the same as modern civilization. That is, for all the great things that happened in terms of human lifestyle, life span, and growing food before 1800, civilization didn\u2019t change dramatically until we started using coal in the U.K. in the 1800s. Coal replaced wood. But the wave of wood to coal is about a 50- or 60-year wave. If it was just about economics, if we had no global warming to think about, the slowly-but-surely pace of these transitions would be okay. If you look at one of these forecasts, they all say about the same thing: What you look at is a picture that\u2019s pretty gradual, with natural gas continuing to gain at the expense of both coal and oil. But, you know, 1-percent-a year-type change. If you look at that from a greenhouse-gas point of view\u2014if you look at forecasts\u2014every single year we\u2019ll be emitting more greenhouse gases than the previous year. On whether we\u2019ve ever done anything as big, as a species, as what he\u2019s asking for now: Well, sort of no. Because the scale of it is very big. People can talk about the Manhattan Project during World War II\u2014the challenge of \u201cHey, should we get a nuclear weapon before, potentially, the Japanese or Germans do?\u201d The speed of innovation there really was mind-blowing. And they had to find two paths to get there. One was enriching uranium; the other was breeding plutonium. And, in fact, the first bomb was a uranium bomb; the second bomb was plutonium. Both paths gave them what they\u2019d hoped for. So there\u2019s some amazing things\u2014people look at the digital realm and see the pace of innovation. And that does kind of spoil you, because you can just put something up on the Web, and a hundred million people can download it. But what we\u2019re asking ourselves to do here is change energy\u2014and that includes all of transport, all of electricity, all of household usage, and all of industrial usage. And those are all huge areas of usage. And somebody\u2019ll say to you, \u201cWell, hey, lighting, LED technology, is going to reduce energy consumption from lighting by over half.\u201d That\u2019s true; it\u2019s a miracle, it\u2019s fantastic. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no equivalent in many of these other things, like making fertilizer or making electricity in a general sense. There\u2019s opportunities to conserve that are really good. But the world is going to consume much more energy 30 years from now than it does today. On whether we should all be driving electric cars: People think, Oh, well, I\u2019ll just get an electric car. There are places where if you buy an electric car, you\u2019re actually increasing CO2 emissions, because the electricity infrastructure is emitting more CO2 than you would have if you\u2019d had a gasoline-powered car. On what it will take to accelerate the transition from carbon-emitting energy: When people viewed cancer as a problem, the U.S. government\u2014and it\u2019s a huge favor to the world\u2014declared a war on cancer, and now we fund all health research at about $30 billion a year, of which about $5 billion goes to cancer. We got serious and did a lot of R&D, and then we got the private sector involved in taking that R&D and building breakthrough drugs. In energy, no government\u2014including the U.S., which is in almost every category the big R&D funder\u2014has really made a dramatic increase. It was increased somewhat under Carter and then cut back under Reagan, and it\u2019s now about $6 billion a year\u2014that\u2019s the U.S. piece, which, compared with the importance to our economy in general, is too low. Realistically, we may not get more than a doubling in government funding of energy R&D\u2014but I would love to see a tripling, to $18 billion a year from the U.S. government to fund basic research alone. Now, as a percentage of the government budget, that\u2019s not gigantic. But we are at a time when the flexibility\u2014because of health costs and other things, but primarily health costs\u2014of the budget is very, very squeezed. But you could do a few-percent tax on all of energy consumption, or you could use the general revenue. This is not an unachievable amount of money. On why, considering the level of debate in the presidential campaign, he thinks this kind of investment is imaginable: Well, the success of the United States in medical research is really incredible. I mean, it\u2019s phenomenal. We spend $30 billion a year of government money, and the private sector goes out and comes up with new drugs. It\u2019s an industry that the U.S. is by far the leader in\u2014creating wonderful jobs, great miracle cures\u2014and that is working super, super well, but we spend more than all other countries put together. And the U.S. lead in health technologies, including drugs, is gigantic, just like the U.S. lead in digital technologies is gigantic. In the case of the digital technologies, the path back to government R&D is a bit more complex, because nowadays most of the R&D has moved to the private sector. But the original Internet comes from the government, the original chip-foundry stuff comes from the government\u2014and even today there\u2019s some government money taking on some of the more advanced things and making sure the universities have the knowledge base that maintains that lead. So I\u2019d say the overall record for the United States on government R&D is very, very good. Now, in the case of climate change, because there\u2019s so many possible solutions, it\u2019s not like the Manhattan Project. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, pick just one approach, and pick some ranch in New Mexico, and just have those guys kind of hang out there.\u201d Here, we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that high wind will work; we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that taking sunlight and making oil directly out of sunlight will work. So there\u2019s dozens of those ideas, and there\u2019s enabling technologies for those ideas. That\u2019s the kind of thing that we should be funding more of. On the limits of wind power and solar photovoltaic cells: Wind has grown super-fast, on a very subsidized basis. Solar, off a smaller base, has been growing even faster\u2014again on a highly subsidized basis. But it\u2019s absolutely fair to say that even the modest R&D that\u2019s been done, and the various deployment incentives that are there, have worked well. Now, unfortunately, solar photovoltaic is still not economical, but the biggest problem of all is this intermittency. That is, we need energy 24 hours a day. So, putting aside hydro\u2014which unfortunately can\u2019t grow much\u2014the primary new zero-CO2 sources are intermittent. Now, nuclear is a non-CO2 source, but it\u2019s had its own problems in terms of costs, big safety problems, making sure you can deal with the waste, making sure the plutonium isn\u2019t used to make weapons. So my view is that the biggest problem for the two lead candidates is that storage looks to be so difficult. It\u2019s kind of ironic: Germany, by installing so much rooftop solar, has it that both their coal plants and their rooftop solar are available in the summer, and the price of power during the day actually goes negative\u2014they pay people to take it. Then at night the only source is the coal, and because the energy companies have to recover their capital costs, they either raise the price because they\u2019re not getting any return for the day, or they slowly go bankrupt. There are many people working on storage\u2014batteries are a form of storage, and there\u2019s a few others, like compressed air, hot metals. But it\u2019s not at all clear that we will get grid-scale economic storage. We\u2019re more than a factor of 10 away from the economics to get that. On the self-defeating claims of some clean-energy enthusiasts: They have this statement that the cost of solar photovoltaic is the same as hydrocarbon\u2019s. And that\u2019s one of those misleadingly meaningless statements. What they mean is that at noon in Arizona, the cost of that kilowatt-hour is the same as a hydrocarbon kilowatt-hour. But it doesn\u2019t come at night, it doesn\u2019t come after the sun hasn\u2019t shone, so the fact that in that one moment you reach parity, so what? The reading public, when they see things like that, they underestimate how hard this thing is. So false solutions like divestment or \u201cOh, it\u2019s easy to do\u201d hurt our ability to fix the problems. Distinguishing a real solution from a false solution is actually very complicated. On the role of private investors: I think dozens and dozens of approaches should be funded at the R&D level, and then people like myself, who can afford to take big risks with start-up companies, should\u2014because of climate change\u2014be willing to put some number of billions into the spin-offs that will come out of that government-funded activity. You can\u2019t expect that it will be like a digital thing. So you do have to bring a more patient investor, and even a lower return threshold, to this than to other things. People often talk about, \u201cWell, the solution that gets us beyond the CO2-based energy economy will be a mix of things.\u201d And it will be a mix\u2014but a few will be very big. And so the companies that find whatever turns out to be the mainstream, they will do super, super well. But there won\u2019t be as many successes here as there are in an area like software, where there\u2019s a lot more variety. On why energy is a global challenge: People can always say, \u201cWell, my country is such a small part of it\u2014why should I make the sacrifice? Because I don\u2019t know for sure that the other countries are going to do their part of it.\u201d We don\u2019t have a world government. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have that many world problems\u2014most problems can be solved locally\u2014but this one is a world problem. Carbon is not a local pollutant. It mixes in the global atmosphere in a matter of days. So it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it\u2019s a coal plant in China or a coal plant in the U.S.\u2014the heating effect for the entire globe is the same. On the dangerous certainty of environmentalists: The heating levels have not tracked the climate models exactly, and the skeptics have had a heyday with that. It\u2019s all within the error-bar range. To me, it\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s nothing that relieves this as a big problem. But when people act like we have this great certainty, they somewhat undermine the credibility. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in this, but on both the good and the bad side. By overclaiming, or even trying to ascribe current things more to climate change than to other effects, environmentalists lend weight to the skeptics. Like, in the near term, the Pacific oscillation, this El Ni\u00f1o thing, has a much bigger impact on current weather than climate change has had so far. Now, climate change keeps climbing all the time\u2014it just keeps summing, summing, summing, and adding up. So, as you get up to 2050, 2080, 2100, its effect overwhelms the Pacific oscillation. So we have to have dramatic change here. It\u2019s unprecedented to move this quickly, to change an infrastructure of this scale\u2014it\u2019s really unprecedented. And, when you turn to India and say, \u201cPlease cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that\u2019s really expensive, subsidized energy,\u201d that\u2019s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer. That\u2019s why we really need to solve that dilemma, we need innovation that gives us energy that\u2019s cheaper than today\u2019s hydrocarbon energy, that has zero CO2 emissions, and that\u2019s as reliable as today\u2019s overall energy system. And when you put all those requirements together, we need an energy miracle. That may make it seem too daunting to people, but in science, miracles are happening all the time. On the central role of rich countries: I\u2019m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they\u2019ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China\u2019s defined into that term. On whether he\u2019s really read all 36 books by Vaclav Smil, his favorite author and a leading scholar of the history of energy use: I have read all of Smil. There\u2019s a book about the transition of the Japanese diet. I don\u2019t recommend it. On the limitations of a campaign to force university endowments and other funds to divest from fossil-fuel companies: If you think divestment alone is a solution, I worry you\u2019re taking whatever desire people have to solve this problem and kind of using up their idealism and energy on something that won\u2019t emit less carbon\u2014because only a few people in society are the owners of the equity of coal or oil companies. As long as there\u2019s no carbon tax and that stuff is legal, everybody should be able to drive around. So I\u2019ve been saying, \u201cHey, come on\u2014broaden your message to be pro\u2013R&D.\u201d And even the same people who are divesting those stocks of energy companies, ideally some of that money would come into this pool that is funding these high-risk innovations. And so that\u2019s a message that I\u2019ve started to get out. I don\u2019t know if that will be successful. On the surprising wisdom of government R&D: When I first got into this I thought, How well does the Department of Energy spend its R&D budget? And I was worried: Gosh, if I\u2019m going to be saying it should double its budget, if it turns out it\u2019s not very well spent, how am I going to feel about that? But as I\u2019ve really dug into it, the DARPA money is very well spent, and the basic-science money is very well spent. The government has these \u201cCenters of Excellence.\u201d They should have twice as many of those things, and those things should get about four times as much money as they do. Yes, the government will be somewhat inept\u2014but the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them. And it\u2019s just that every once in a while a Google or a Microsoft comes out, and some medium-scale successes too, and so the overall return is there, and so people keep giving them money. On why he thinks Congress may not be hopeless: The U.S. Congress does support solar and wind subsidies, which have been quite generous. So Congress isn\u2019t completely absent on this. The House actually passed a climate-change bill [in 2009], when it was a Democratic Congress. There\u2019s a class of voters who care about this, that I think both parties should want to compete for. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hopeless, because it\u2019s about American innovation, American jobs, American leadership, and there are examples where this has gone very, very well. On the centrality of government to progress on energy, historically: Everyone likes to argue about how much the shale-gas boom was driven by the private sector versus government; there was some of both. Nuclear: huge amount of government. Hydropower: mind-blowingly government\u2014because permitting those things, those big reservoirs and everything, you can\u2019t be a private-sector guy betting that you\u2019re going to get permitted. People think energy is more of a private-sector thing than it is. If you go back to Edison\u2019s time, there wasn\u2019t much government funding. There were rich people funding him. Since World War II, U.S.-government R&D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. But energy moves really slowly. There\u2019s this thing Vaclav Smil says: If Edison were reborn today, he would find our batteries completely understandable, because it\u2019s just chemistry. He would say, \u201cOh, cool, you found lithium, that was nice.\u201d Nuclear-power plants, he would go, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d That, he would be impressed with. And chips, which we can use for managing data and stuff, he\u2019d be impressed with. But he could visit a coal plant and say, \u201cOkay, you scaled it up.\u201d He would visit a natural-gas plant and that would look pretty normal to him; he would look at an internal-combustion engine and he wouldn\u2019t be that surprised. On his faith in human ingenuity: If you told me that innovation had been frozen and we just have today\u2019s technologies, will the world run the climate-change experiment? You bet we will. We will not deny India coal plants; we will run the scary experiment of heating up the atmosphere and see what happens. The only reason I\u2019m optimistic about this problem is because of innovation. And innovation is a very uncertain process. For all I know, even if we don\u2019t up the R&D, 10 years from now some guy will invent something and it\u2019ll take care of this thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely, but nobody has a predictor function of innovation\u2014which is weird, because the whole modern economy and our lifestyles are an accumulation of innovations. So I want to tilt the odds in our favor by driving innovation at an unnaturally high pace, or more than its current business-as-usual course. I see that as the only thing. I want to call up India someday and say, \u201cHere\u2019s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it\u2019s also better.\u201d I think if we don\u2019t get that in the next 15 years, then as much as people care about this thing, we will at least run the 2-degree experiment. Then there\u2019s the question of \u201cOkay, do we run the 3-degree experiment? Do we run the 4-degree experiment?\u201d","headline":"Bill Gates: \u2018We Need an Energy Miracle\u2019","article_name":407881.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2015\/11\/we-need-an-energy-miracle\/407881\/","date_published":"2015-10-13 13:07:51","article_length":22343,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:46.680846","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2015\/11\/we-need-an-energy-miracle\/407881\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Lawmakers want to cut Earth-monitoring program in favor of space travel. NASA controls more than a dozen satellites and spacecraft, monitoring everything from melting ice to water storage to rain and snow. To the agency's scientists and supporters, these programs are essential to understanding the planet and the changing climate, and part of its core mission. But to congressional Republicans, they are just another example of an administration wasting money on climate-change research, zapping funds away from what NASA should be doing: blasting into and exploring space. House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, last week moved a two-year NASA bill through his committee that would shift money away from the Earth Science program to spend on planetary exploration. \"There are 13 other agencies involved in climate-change research, but only one that is responsible for space exploration,\" Smith said at a recent hearing. Sen. Ted Cruz, another Texan, who oversees the Commerce subcommittee in charge of NASA, has likewise said it's time for NASA to refocus on space exploration. At a hearing earlier this year, Cruz said that the \"core function of NASA is to explore space\" and \"NASA in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.\" Smith and Cruz represent a state flush with NASA facilities and spending, which would stand to benefit from seeing the planetary program flourish. Both are also global-warming skeptics; Cruz, a presidential candidate, has compared climate-change believers to \"flat earthers\" and questions the science tying human actions to rising temperatures. Republicans across the board are going after President Obama's climate agenda, cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department, encouraging lawsuits against climate rules, and introducing bills that would roll back virtually every regulation that gets proposed. NASA is just the latest target. Under Obama, NASA's Earth Science budget has been increased from $1.38 billion in 2009 to $1.77 billion in 2015. The data from that program has a whole suite of uses, everything from weather forecasting to military planning to crop planning. NASA has also been aggressive about using its findings to educate the public on climate change and the need to address greenhouse-gas emissions. For instance, this week NASA put together a rundown \u00a0with 10 agency scientists explaining the news that the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had reached 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history. Scientists who have worked for NASA and rely on its data say that it's also the only agency capable of handling its Earth Science agenda. Because of NASA's decades-long experience in launching satellites and tracking their data, it's not as simple as handing the keys over to, say, the Fish and Wildlife Service. Waleed Abdalati, who served as NASA's chief scientist from 2011 to 2012, said that programs like the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, mission are not just part of a climate research portfolio, they're the backbone to other valuable research. Under GRACE, a pair of satellites circle the Earth mapping variations in the planet's gravity field, allowing scientists to detect changes in ocean currents, water storage, and variations of land mass. The measurements can track things as specific as the land mass lost in Greenland and Antarctica, tracking melting ice and rising sea levels. \"That's not something any other agency can do, and it's fundamental to our understanding of what our changing sea levels will look like,\" said Abdalati, now the director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"NASA figures out new ways to look at things and understands processes that have not been developed before.\" The House Science Committee last week passed a two-year NASA authorization bill that would authorize the Earth Sciences program budget at $1.45 billion each year, with the planetary science program set at $1.5 billion (it's currently enacted at just over $1.4 billion). Other science programs, like astrophysics ($730 million) and heliophysics ($651 million) would be in line or slightly increased from Obama's budget request. While the Earth Sciences budget has increased at the expense of other NASA programs under Obama, it's still below where it was before cuts under the Bush administration. The budget in fiscal 2000 was $1.69 billion ($2.29 billion when adjusted for inflation), and FactCheck.org notes that's still a higher percentage of NASA's overall budget than even today's restored figures. And that's on top of cuts to NASA's top-line budget that started under Bush and were accelerated by sequestration. A 2012 report by the National Academies of Science warned that the \"inadequate\" funding levels under the Bush administration heralded a \"rapid decline\" in Earth observation. In a March hearing, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden also said that the planetary exploration budget has dropped by design\u2014NASA is trying to make it cheaper to run long-distance missions. Bolden said last week that the House proposal \"threatens to set back generations worth of progress in better understanding our changing climate, and our ability to prepare for and respond to earthquakes, droughts, and storm events.\" Science Committee ranking member Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas wrote in a column last week that the budget had been \"made captive to ideological fervor,\" accusing Republicans of cutting valuable research in order to slash climate funding anywhere they could. The Senate hasn't yet drafted a NASA bill of its own, and a Commerce spokesman did not say when the committee would move one, but Sen. Gary Peters\u2014the Michigan Democrat who serves as ranking member of the space subcommittee\u2014said he feared that Cruz could push similar cuts. \"If folks are trying to move a political agenda, they shouldn't cut off the research into basic science that can lead to better public-policy decisions,\" Peters said. Mark Abbott, a professor at Oregon State University who has served on the National Academies committee behind the 2012 report, said the notion of parity between Earth Sciences and planetary exploration was understandable but offered a narrow view of how NASA tries to split its work. \"There's always been a discussion about what the balance between exploration and earth science should be,\" said Abbott, the dean of OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. \"But the whole 'Mission to Planet Earth' idea is a powerful organizing view.\" The \"Mission to Planet Earth\" is the former name for the Earth Sciences program, launched under President George H.W. Bush and championed under President Reagan, as noted by the Houston Chronicle . The 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act that created NASA even says that space activities should contribute to \"the expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.\" It's a program that supporters say goes well beyond measuring climate change. The GRACE program, for example, has also been used to track changes in California that can hold implications for water storage in the state's ongoing drought. Other NASA satellites are measuring ocean salinity and sea-level rise, consequences of climate change that hold serious implications for coastal areas. The Global Precipitation Measurement missions track snow and rain, measurements scientists say could be used to predict extreme storms. \"Nobody I know thinks of this in political terms,\" said Berrien Moore, former science advisory committee member at NASA and the dean of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of Oklahoma. \"This is a scientific question. These are all hard questions, and this is the only cost-effective way to do it. \"You can have computer models, you can run the models, but you have to have global data and you have to be monitoring this around the globe,\" Moore added. Republicans have argued that NASA's work isn't necessary, given the number of other agencies working on climate research and the opportunities in the private sector. A separate bill set to be voted on by the full House later this month would clear the way for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to start incorporating commercial satellites and weather data in its own activities, which sponsors say will improve the administration's forecasting abilities. Abdalati said that ultimately, tight budgets will likely curtail the Earth observation work, but that legislators would do well to reconsider cutting a \"fundamental element of the NASA mission.\" \"In a nation like ours, there's room to invest in understanding the planet that's most important to us in the universe, as well as those missions that touch on the human spirit of exploration,\" he said. \"Whatever you feel about climate change, nobody can dispute the value of knowing what lies ahead on Earth.\"","headline":"Republicans: NASA Wastes Money on Climate-Change Research","article_name":452505.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/05\/republicans-nasa-wastes-money-on-climate-change-research\/452505\/","date_published":"2015-05-07 20:01:00","article_length":9049,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:47.091852","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/05\/republicans-nasa-wastes-money-on-climate-change-research\/452505\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In the heat of COVID-19 and climate change, it\u2019s too easy to forget what flourishing feels like. On the first day of summer, Siberia and I were the same temperature. In Verkhoyansk, roughly 3,000 miles northeast of Moscow, a searing week ended in an afternoon hotter than any before recorded north of the Arctic Circle. Half a planet away in New England, a thermometer under my tongue gave the same reading: 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. In a human, this is the clinical threshold for a fever. We had also been too hot for too long, Siberia and I. Most days since mid-May, I have lived in a body a degree or two and occasionally three above normal. Siberia is even more pyretic, averaging more than nine degrees above the 20th-century norm from January onward. Russian friends sent photos of berries flushed ripe a month early. Dark clots of mosquitoes stuck on window screens. In places, the land itself is wobbly and out of joint, as melting permafrost opens large slump pits and gullies. By May, tundra peat was burning. The boreal forests broke into wildfires. These conflagrations are now the worst that Russia has seen, blazing on toward autumn. The heat across northern Eurasia is uncanny but not mysterious. Our atmosphere, saturated with the carbon of burned fossil fuels, is becoming that of a prehuman time, one last present on Earth 3 million years ago. The poles are warming at about twice the rate of temperate regions, making Siberia\u2019s current climate anomalies the future of those regions too. Such transformations crack open ecological worlds and the lives within them. Given the scale and implication of events in northern Eurasia, calling this season the Summer of Siberia would not be hyperbole. Read: America is being pummeled by disasters Yet it is my malady, not Siberia\u2019s, that rules conversations and headlines. I am too hot because of a persistent case of COVID-19, what its sufferers have begun calling \u201clong COVID.\u201d Mine is one case among millions, a pace of infection that, like distant wildfires, will roar into fall. So perhaps it is no wonder that, from America, Eurasia\u2019s heat feels like an abstraction. Siberia and its inhabitants are far; much suffering is close. How do we take in the ruptures of a burning world when our own bodies are alight? My body has been alight for months now. From within this illness, I have come to think that Siberia and I endure more than a coincidence in temperature. Our fevers are stoked by related patterns of economic production, patterns both relatively new and seemingly inevitable. And my corporeal fire says something about how a continental fire can go unseen, offering a lesson in the implications of duration: how as a condition lingers, its origins or significance grow harder to see. Long COVID and climate change are alike in this: live ill for long enough, and the absence of health threatens to become normal. Two summers ago, I was in Russia, on a comma of rocky Bering Sea beach called Napkum Spit. It was August, the turquoise water free of ice and full of spotted seals. Far off, a gray whale spouted, its breath tracking a shimmering mist against the horizon. North and south from this place, Indigenous kin and culture are nourished by hunts of grey and bowhead whales. For Yupik and Chukchi, peoples whose ancestors have lived along the Bering Sea for thousands of years, whales\u2019 flesh is food, their beings woven into the necessities and ceremonies of daily life. I was on Napkum Spit because of a different kind of whaling. My work as a historian had led me to the logbooks of the New England fleet, which began killing Bering Sea cetaceans in the 1840s. These sailors hunted whales for oil and baleen, to light homes and brace corsets where I now live, in Rhode Island, and all along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. I wanted to see what marks remained in this whaling ground. I expected something tangible, even monumental. In 50 years, the Yankee fleet killed tens of thousands of whales. Around that loss, the Bering Sea ecosystem transformed, likely feeding more squid and fish in the ecological spaces once home to bowheads and grays. But these species were inaccessible to Yupik and Chukchi. By the 1880s, famine claimed families, then whole villages, many also suffering from epidemic diseases transported north by wooden ships. Had I lived in Rhode Island then, I would have lit whale-oil lamps at dusk, with baleen cinching my ribs, and seen nothing of that suffering. A hundred and twenty years later, to one recently arrived on Napkum Spit from New England, the traces of commercial whaling were imperceptible still. There were no hulking shipwrecks, or graves, or mounds of whale skulls, only that single whale spout on the horizon. The memorial to market killing is absence. The Yankee fleet ceased harrowing the waters off Siberia by 1900, yet bowhead and gray-whale populations are still shy of their former plenty. The only Bering Sea I have ever seen, the only one I can experience, would have seemed eerily bereft in 1840. That same year, I visited an abandoned mining town to the southwest. Shakhtyorsky was a Soviet creation, wrested from the tundra\u2019s green sedges. A vein of lignite coal ran under the hills; miners, or shakhtyory , came here to peel away dirt, permafrost, and stone, then haul out fuel by the black, dusty ton. At its peak, the town was coated in a thin layer of grime, exhaled from the mines and the generators that powered heavy equipment. Coal dust stunted plant growth; coal heaps leached acid into streams. All around Shakhtyorsky, the process of extraction left the earth hollow and pocked. In miniature, it did the same to human lungs. Years of breathing sulphur and black dust caused coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, or black lung; in severe cases, lesions in the lung tissues necrotized, leaving empty, dead cavities. Yet had I flipped a switch powered by Shakhtyorsky coal in 1970, or 1980, I would have seen no sign of the scarred lands or bodies behind the light. Read: America\u2019s coal consumption is in free fall Napkum Spit and Shakhtyorsky are alike in this: they are monuments to how, in the 19th and 20th centuries, people of comparative wealth could consume parts of the Arctic\u2014as they consumed Indian cotton, Caribbean sugar, Middle Eastern oil, South American bananas, and dozens of other products from distant parts of the world\u2014at a remove from the costs of their manufacture. Long before COVID-19 turned grocery stocking and Amazon delivery into dangerous work, consumption was healthier at a distance. And that severed use from consequence. If most Americans now pay little heed to Siberia\u2019s burn, perhaps it is because recent history has made material plenty and heedlessness coincident. Wealth is freedom not just from bearing the consequence of using up the world, but from paying attention to it. That might have worked 200 years, ago, a century ago, even a lifetime ago. Today, the speed and intensity of 21st-century life erodes the space between the costs of production and the benefits of consumption. What starts far off in the Arctic\u2014or in China, or anywhere\u2014does not remain there. Or, put another way, the same dynamics that warm Siberia also warm me. There are many examples of this, how burning trees and fossil fuels alter the composition of the atmosphere while moving people and, with them, viruses. Modern agriculture, which turns petroleum into fertilizer, concentrates sites of possible infection and transmission between livestock and humans. Industrialization replaces animal homes with human ones, and with markets for fauna such as the bats that gave us this coronavirus. As loggers turn forests into furniture, they push more species into new intimacy with people. Deforestation also emits billions of tons of carbon each year. That carbon warms the planet more; a warmed planet forces more animals to move, which makes viral transfer more likely. Siberia\u2019s wildfires are deforestation at an immense and terribly efficient scale. This year, about 50 million acres of forest and grasslands have already burned, more than a Greece\u2019s worth of plant life blown into a pall of smoke so massive it now sits over Alaska and Washington State. A month of such burning releases as much carbon dioxide as a small country\u2014Portugal, or Sweden\u2014does in a year. No summer on record has seen less ice in the Arctic Ocean; the greatest losses are north of Russia\u2019s baking landmass, in the Barents and Laptev Seas. Ice at the poles anchors the stability of our climate. Even if we pay it no heed, this hot summer in Siberia is shifting the terms of what normal is out from under us all. Playing host to the coronavirus for three months has made me think about normalcy\u2014its shifty character, how it plays with my sense of time\u2014and the drive to pretend that things are at stasis, despite all evidence indicating turmoil. My case of COVID-19 was never acute; I was not on a ventilator or even close, nor do I have the harsher ills of many long-haulers, who report roving pain, memory loss, tachycardia. My experience of the virus has not been an event so much as a shift, erosion rather than earthquake. The most enduring symptom is a corporeal heat wave that shows no more sign of fully lifting than the warmth in northern Eurasia. As the weeks drag on, the hale clarity of my normal self is receding. Perhaps this is just what I am now: weaker, wan, soggy-brained. An amazing and terrible thing about being human is how quickly we adapt to circumstances unthinkable just years, or months, or weeks in the past. The marine ecologist Daniel Pauly calls this the problem of \u201cshifting baselines\u201d: assuming that observations this year or this decade represent life at its most flourishing. A whaler fresh to the Bering Strait in 1850 saw thousands of bowheads; 50 years later, a new sailor might have assumed that the species was naturally scarce. A miner who came to Shakhtyorsky in 1980 would never breathe air free of coal dust. In April I assumed I could wake each morning and work \u2019til evening; now I route my days around my body\u2019s weather. People born in Siberia early this century have watched summers warm dramatically. Their children may never know it otherwise; unless carbon emissions halt, this year\u2019s average temperature in Siberia will likely be the norm at the century\u2019s end. Read: This is your life on climate change The danger of acceptance is in how ill it leaves bodies and the places they live. I am not well, at 99.8 degrees, or 99.2, or 100.1, even if those are the temperatures I experience more days than not. The swaths of Siberia choking in smoke are not well, nor are their people. But the very slowness, the week-in, week-out constancy of climate change or enduring infection, is lulling. It is tedious to tell people I am still sick. Sustaining alarm at a thousand people dying in a day is more difficult in August than it was in April. Siberia is too hot, still, but it has not exceeded the record of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit set in July. A 98-degree afternoon in Verkhoyansk is now not an event; it is just a day. The phenomenal becomes mere background. As summer tips toward autumn\u2014an autumn in which there will be too little sea ice and too much virus\u2014I do not want to forget the possibilities of my April self, or of Siberia without fire, or of whales by the tens of thousands. The need to build a society that cares for all, that does not let some hide in the safety of distance, has never been more acute. The habits of wealth need reconditioning to account for the real costs of consumption. These are forward-looking projects. My experience of this virus makes me think, however, that we should not forget a longer view, one able to see how the conditions of 2020 are not inevitable. The line of heat that connects my body and Siberia has existed for only a few centuries. It is not inevitable. Thinking past it, as this summer of our many discontents moves into fall, requires a kind of split imagination: to conjure moments of past flourishing, and a future where we might flourish again.","headline":"The Empty Space Where Normal Once Lived","article_name":615844.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2020\/08\/covid-19-and-climate-change-have-same-root-cause\/615844\/","date_published":"2020-08-28 14:35:35","article_length":12084,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:47.833460","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2020\/08\/covid-19-and-climate-change-have-same-root-cause\/615844\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Introducing Atlantic Planet I\u2019ve been covering climate change for The Atlantic for five years, or nearly a sixth of the time I\u2019ve been alive. That\u2019s long enough to watch the world change around me. I covered America\u2019s adoption of the Paris Agreement and our plan to depart it; in 2017, I warned that Democrats were shockingly unprepared to pass climate policy, then I watched the party unite around a new agenda . Today, The Atlantic is launching Planet , a new section devoted to climate change, along with The Weekly Planet , a new newsletter. We\u2019ve made them because we recognize\u2014as you might too\u2014that climate change is the backdrop of our lives and one of the moral crises of the century, a globe-spanning force reshaping how we work, how we play, how we shop, and how we vote. We hope to be your guide to living through climate change, a source of expert information and thoughtful analysis that\u2019s less angel-on-your-shoulder and more friend-at-your-side. Sign up for The Weekly Planet Here\u2019s what you can expect from Planet in the days and months to come: First: We will cover climate change in the present tense\u2014not as a distant threat, but as a force that is already reconfiguring business, culture, society, and life on Earth. This outlook doesn\u2019t reflect our prediction about where the world is heading; we think a detached assessment of the facts allows for no other conclusion. Second: We will recognize that the economy is made of real stuff\u2014purring servers, fields of alfalfa, wind-spun turbines, muscle and bone. So we\u2019ll also recognize that solving climate change and zeroing out carbon pollution requires getting elbow-deep in reality. A gallon of gasoline isn\u2019t a price by the side of the road; it\u2019s a physical reserve of fossilized sunlight, the refined residue of what was once 25 metric tons of ancient sea life. To leave fossil fuels behind, we must find a new source of energy to replace that prehistoric sun. Finally: We will understand that climate change is too serious to be taken seriously all the time. When Justin Bieber plays a laid-off oil-rig worker in a music video, it isn\u2019t just an entertainment story; it\u2019s a climate story. When one in four childless adults says that climate change shaped their reproductive decisions, it is of course a climate story, but it\u2019s also a sex story. And when the government of Tulsa, Oklahoma, repaints its giant downtown statue of an oil driller to look like Elon Musk, and then doesn\u2019t even get the Tesla factory it was angling for, it is very funny, in addition to being a scandalously pathetic use of tax dollars. Planet might be new, but its approach to climate coverage has long been at home at The Atlantic. Our writers have covered aspiring mammoth cloners and would-be geo-engineers . Nearly 40 years ago, Tracy Kidder wrote in our pages that scientists were studying difficult questions raised by \u201cthe greenhouse effect.\u201d And in our first issue, in 1857, our founders wrote that the magazine would be of \u201cno party or clique.\u201d That famous line has appeared in our table of contents, off and on, for the past century and a half. Read: The heat gap But another sentence followed it. The founders did not reject partisanship because they wished to avoid taking sides, or out of some faith in the journalistic \u201cview from nowhere.\u201d Instead, their dislike for clannishness flowed from their concern for nuance and a higher kind of truth. The Atlantic , the founders wrote, should \u201cdeal frankly\u201d with people and parties\u2014and it should always \u201ckeep in view that moral element which transcends all persons and parties, and which alone makes the basis of a true and lasting national prosperity.\u201d For the past few years, I\u2019ve had those words taped to my desk on an index card. They paint a marvelous picture\u2014of an invisible substance that molds each of us, permeates all our politics, hums with morality, and somehow implicates our abundance. It\u2019s just a metaphor, of course. And yet\u2014in one of those gasps of historical foresight\u2014the image suggests what we now call the climate.","headline":"A New Way of Thinking About Climate Change","article_name":616706.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/10\/introducing-atlantic-planet\/616706\/","date_published":"2020-10-15 12:22:26","article_length":4042,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:49.287810","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/10\/introducing-atlantic-planet\/616706\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Events of 2011 show that no matter how solid the science, some people will never accept that humans are causing global warming. One version of the myth of King Midas holds that he was not greedy. Instead, he loved his daughter so much that he longed to leave her a stable future. When given the chance, he asked for the golden touch as a way to create an endowment. But when they embraced, she turned to gold as well. In trying to protect his beloved daughter, Midas destroyed her. Some climate change deniers have the same admirable motive as Midas. The actions required to solve climate, they fear, will preclude us from capturing the wealth that can benefit or save many children today. Even the left argues that a rising economic tide lifts all boats, despite the fact that continued growth probably dooms the planet to runaway warming.\u00a0 Environmentalists fear that no action on climate condemns us to an even more costly fate that threatens every child, forever. Finding a fix, then, seems close to impossible. What we learned in 2011--a banner year for human understanding of climate change and its impact on our lives--helps explain why. In October, climate-change skeptic Dr. Richard Muller released the results of a two-year study at the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project that was funded in part by the Koch brothers, leading climate deniers. Muller's report, in his own words, found that \"global warming is real.\" In fact, Muller found warming to be \"on the high end\" of what others had found. The results were reported in the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page . 2011 also gave a taste of what climatologists have long predicted: that a warmer world will experience more severe weather events, both droughts and storms. PBS reported on \"mind-boggling extreme weather\" resulting from warming, what Dr. Jeff Masters, Director of Meteorology at the Weather Underground, Inc. calls \"steroids for the atmosphere.\" This summer, droughts in the Southwest matched those of the dust bowl and a tornado outbreak blew away the record 1974 season. USA Today reported how natural disasters were straining FEMA's budget. In the last week of 2011, Vermont fixed the last of the roads destroyed by flooding from Hurricane Irene. At the same time, still more peer-reviewed science came out showing that the anthropogenic warming signal is unmistakable. Grant Foster and Stefan Rahmstorf's paper in Environmental Research Letters stripped out the known non-human influences on climate (El Ni\u00f1o, volcanic aerosols and solar variability, among others) and found human-induced warming to be clear and consistent. Meanwhile, a new paper by Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows , from the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester and published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society argued that society is at substantial risk of exceeding warming of 2\u00b0C, the threshold widely seen to be the difference between something to which we could possibly adapt and disaster. Last, and least noted, has been the inability of climate deniers to produce peer-reviewed science showing that warming is not human caused. Their anecdotal claims are easily debunked: the sun is at a minimum, despite record global temperatures. Cosmic-ray activity hasn't coincided with modern warming. Volcanoes emit far less CO 2 than humans. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas that is exacerbated by CO 2 induced warming. The earth has warmed before, of course, but always with a well understood cause, just like we have today. One might imagine the economic damage of 2011's storms would get deniers thinking. Can we continue to rebuild roads and bridges, sump out towns and drench fires, or, might ought we do something about it? And since cutting CO 2 emissions will cool the planet, is that not a good place to start? Well, no. In 2011, the result of the head-smacking obviousness of the science, as Naomi Klein pointed out in The Nation , is that opposition has become even more strident, in large part because deniers are no fools. Fully dealing with climate change, Klein observed, would require \"that we break every rule in the free-market playbook and that we do so with great urgency.\" The climate message didn't fail, Klein argued: It simply got through too clearly. At the same time that the right became more rigid, Leslie Kaufman of the New York Times reported on the radicalization of the environmental movement in response to lack of policy action. She quoted Roger Ballentine, a climate adviser to the Clinton White House: \"The failure to address climate is catastrophic, and young people are justifiably outraged. What we have now is an antagonized grassroots calling for a radicalized approach.\" Such an approach did develop, most notably in the form of 12,000 protesters who surrounded the White House and blocked the Keystone XL pipeline that would bring the most carbon-intensive fuel--tar sands oil--into the US from Canada. In 2011, scientific certainty didn't clear up anything at all, it just energized the left and the right, in opposite directions, confirming historian Naomi Oreskes's notion that climate-change denial has never been about the science, it was always about ideology. So we start 2012 with an unprecedented understanding of climate science and the consequences of warming, and at the same time seemingly irreconcilable differences on what to do, a Gordian Knot of a problem; complex and intractable, ingeniously self-tightening. Solutions will require the boldness, innovation, and rule breaking of Alexander the Great, who famously used a sword to cut that knot. But uniquely today, we'll need the political right and left to hold the blade without killing each other first. Some feel the only path to this future is enough of a climate signal--Manhattan under water--to make action obvious. Others see bipartisan solutions percolating even today: eliminating the payroll tax and replacing it with a carbon fee, for example, or eliminating subsidies for big oil and using that money for clean energy development, meet goals both left and right. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to understand its cause. Who, for example, tied the legendary Gordian Knot, a good metaphor for the puzzle we face today? It turns out it was a man known by some to be kind and fair, but whose vision of affluence led to disaster. He was a king. And his name was Midas.

{"id":null,"body":"Why it\u2019s so difficult to talk about the new bombshell climate paper There has never before been a scientific study quite like the one released this week by James Hansen, a climate scientist and the former director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The paper, published Tuesday in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , reports that the near-term effects of climate change could be much more catastrophic than previously anticipated. It warns that, by 2100, the planet\u2019s natural system could change so dramatically that enormous \u201csuperstorms,\u201d sometimes powerful enough to hurl ocean boulders hundreds of feet into the air, will form in the Atlantic Ocean. Seas could also rise so quickly that they will inundate coastal cities\u2014including New York, Washington, and San Francisco\u2014rendering them unlivable before the end of the century. Hansen\u2019s paper isn\u2019t the first to spell out a scenario for climate doom. What makes it so harrowing, though, is that it says all these consequences would follow the global average temperature rising a relatively small amount: only two degrees Celsius. That isn\u2019t an arbitrary target. The nations of the world have repeatedly agreed to keep climate change specifically below two degrees Celsius, but, without as yet uninvented technology, it will be scientifically unlikely . If these terrifying conclusions sound familiar, it\u2019s because they were first in the news last summer, when Hansen and his 18 co-authors\u2014all climatologists, geologists, or academic scientists in their own right\u2014released the paper online before it was peer reviewed. They said that the paper\u2019s findings were too urgent, and the United Nations climate negotiations that December too imminent, to wait for the complete publication process. \u201cGiven the inertia of the climate and energy systems, and the grave threat posed by continued high emissions, the matter is urgent and calls for emergency cooperation among nations,\u201d they wrote, in the paper\u2019s conclusion. As such, the paper went through an unusually public review process. The New Yorker , Rolling Stone , and The New York Times  all covered the study soon after its release . As other climatologists began to examine its findings, their criticisms made the Times and other newspapers again and again. This was not always a clean process, or a process where reporters could be sure they were publishing scientifically vetted information. Andrew Revkin, the Times writer who followed the public peer-review process from the beginning, has argued since last summer that the study\u2019s unusual method of well-publicized publication could lead to \u201cwhiplash, at best, and confusion and disengagement at worst.\u201d As Revkin noted Tuesday , the peer-review process was not for naught: The final paper was altered, sometimes significantly, from its July 2015 draft. For example, while last year\u2019s version of the paper claimed absolute certainty in its title \u2014 Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2\u00b0 C global warming is highly dangerous \u2014this year\u2019s final version scales that language back: Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2\u00b0 C global warming could be dangerous Now the paper has at last been peer reviewed and published. The Times  and the Post both covered its release on Tuesday, the latter with the headline: \u201c We had all better hope these scientists are wrong about the planet\u2019s future .\u201d And indeed, we had better. Hansen and his team\u2019s predictions are grave. They are out in public again, describing the potential consequences of their findings. Hansen himself posted a video explaining the science of the paper this week. If you\u2019re interested in climate change and the planet, it\u2019s worth watching: He brings together his scientific conclusions with what he believes are the right political actions. At the heart of the findings is his argument that cold meltwater from Greenland is weakening an important internal current in the Atlantic Ocean, called AMOC , that keeps weather across the entire planet temperate. Once this current is shut down, then the Atlantic near the Arctic will stay cold and heat will build up in the southern latitudes, creating the potential for extreme weather of mythical proportions. \u201cI believe we are already watching the beginning of this cooling, southeast of Greenland,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cIn that case, extra cooling and extra warming along the United States East Coast are not natural fluctuations. The warm water is the reason that [Hurricane] Sandy retained hurricane-force winds up to the New York City area.\u201d \u201cHave we passed a point of no return? I doubt it, but it\u2019s conceivable,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly, it may be too late to avoid sea-level rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities.\u201d The haste that Hansen is calling for here feels like a major change in how experts talk about climate to the public\u2014a change perhaps as significant as Al Gore\u2019s An Inconvenient Truth, 10 years old this May. It\u2019s in line with how the Syrian civil war has been increasingly tied to the consequences of climate change ; or the ways that public figures\u2014including Miami\u2019s Republican mayor \u2014speak about global warming as a thing happening now instead of in the future. Hansen is trying to wage a public campaign on behalf of science, using scientific events as news pegs. I think that is indispensable, noble work. It\u2019s the work that Hansen left NASA to do . But as a public consumer of science, it\u2019s important to recognize that this study represents just one scientific finding. Now that Hansen\u2019s findings have been published, they will be tested and vetted and re-checked. Notably, they do not carry the imprimatur of, say, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which releases consensus reports about the best available science. In fact, that is part of the point: Hansen and his team believe they\u2019ve found mechanisms that more popular climate models, including those used by UN teams, don\u2019t take into account. As such, there is a public responsibility to communicate them clearly. If some of Hansen\u2019s most ambitious arguments prove wrong, it will not invalidate the entire global-warming mechanism. It will not make the need to reduce fossil-fuel use any less dire. It will just mean that the near-term timeline looks somewhat different. So it was odd to see Slate \u2019s in-house meteorologist, Eric Holthaus, describe Hansen\u2019s findings as pat, in a piece headlined \u201c James Hansen\u2019s Bombshell Climate Warning Is Now Part of the Scientific Canon \u201d: The world Hansen and his colleagues describe reads like a sci-fi plot synopsis\u2014and it\u2019s now officially part of the scientific canon (though peer review doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that a paper is infallible). If Hansen and his colleagues are correct, this paper is likely one of the most important scientific contributions in history\u2014and a stark warning to world governments to speed up the transition to carbon-free energy. Hansen\u2019s paper does read like science fiction\u2014in fact, more than one journalist has compared it to The Day After Tomorrow. But to describe it as \u201cofficially part of the scientific canon\u201d is so overstated as to tend toward meaninglessness. Hansen\u2019s paper is scary, ambitious, fascinating, wide-ranging, well-sourced, and very newsworthy\u2014but it\u2019s just another peer-reviewed scientific paper. The peer review and publication process catches many errors, but it does not guarantee anything close to infallibility. (Consider the \u201creplication crisis\u201d now ripping through academic psychology : a controversy entirely about all the errors allowed to seep through peer review.) Right now, Hansen\u2019s paper is exactly \u201cofficially\u201d as much a part of \u201cthe scientific canon\u201d as this paper on \u201cfeminist glaciology\u201d or this more serious one on murderous prairie dogs . This is not to downplay Hansen\u2019s findings\u2014their seriousness, their veracity, or their urgency. It\u2019s not to diminish the climate emergency, either. Talking about something so worrisome, with margins of error so large, on deadline, in public, is hard. I am not guiltless of sensationalizing climate news. Late last year, I cited a science-fiction writer and climate activist while covering a series of unusually warm storms over the Arctic. I implicitly framed him as someone with a claim to scientific expertise that he didn\u2019t have. But this is a new era in climate communications, one in which scientists will try to assert the necessity of action as much as politicians or activists. It is critical that, while giving researchers their prized place in the public sphere, we do not overstate or sensationalize their findings. As journalists, as people speaking in public, and as concerned and vulnerable participants in the Earth system, we owe it to each other to get this right.","headline":"Don't Sensationalize the New Bombshell Climate Paper","article_name":474987.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/03\/the-struggle-of-clear-climate-communication\/474987\/","date_published":"2016-03-23 15:46:36","article_length":8936,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:50.601197","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/03\/the-struggle-of-clear-climate-communication\/474987\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In the 1880s, Vancouver\u2019s seafood joints served lots of salmon. These days they serve squid. This post was originally published by Hakai . Vancouver, British Columbia, is nothing short of a seafood paradise. Situated at the mouth of the formerly salmon-rich Fraser River, the city overlooks Vancouver Island to the west, and beyond that, the open Pacific Ocean. Long before it had a skyline or a deepwater port, this was a bountiful fishing ground for the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh peoples, who still depend on its waters for cultural sustenance. Today, tourists come from all over the world to taste local favorites, such as salmon and halibut, fresh from the water. But beneath these waves, things are changing. Climate change is an intensifying reality for the marine species that live near Vancouver and for the people who depend on them. In a new study , a team from the University of British Columbia (UBC) shows one unexpected way that climate effects are already manifesting in our daily lives. To find it, they looked not at thermometers or ice cores, but at restaurant menus. \u201cWith a menu, you have a physical and digital record that you can compare over time,\u201d explains William Cheung, a fisheries biologist at UBC and one of the study\u2019s authors. Cheung has spent his career studying climate change and its effects on the world\u2019s oceans. He has contributed to several of the landmark reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but along with John-Paul Ng, an undergraduate student at UBC, he wanted to find a different way to both study and communicate those changes. \u201cMany people, especially in Vancouver, go out to restaurants and enjoy seafood, so we wanted to see whether climate change has affected the seafood that the restaurants serve,\u201d Cheung says. Read: Full-bodied with notes of band-aid and medicine The team gathered menus from hundreds of restaurants around the city, as well as from restaurants farther afield in Anchorage, Alaska, and Los Angeles, California. Current menus were easy to find, but digging into the history of Vancouver\u2019s seafood proved a bit trickier. Doing so required help from local museums, historical societies, and even city hall\u2014which the researchers were surprised to learn has records of restaurant menus going back more than a century\u2014to compile their unusual data set. In all, they managed to source menus dating back to the 1880s. Using their records, the scientists created an index called the Mean Temperature of Restaurant Seafood (MTRS), which reflects the water temperature at which the species on the menu like to live. Predictably, they found that the MTRS of Los Angeles was higher than that of Anchorage, with Vancouver falling in the middle. But by analyzing how the MTRS for Vancouver has changed over time, they found a significant trend of warmer-water species becoming more common on restaurant menus. In the 1880s, the MTRS for Vancouver was roughly 10.7 degrees Celsius. Now it is 13.8 degrees Celsius. One restaurant that became an important data point in the study was the historic Fairmont Hotel Vancouver and its restaurant Notch8, a 10-minute walk from the harbor\u2019s edge in the city\u2019s financial district. The researchers were able to find examples of the hotel\u2019s menus from the 1950s, \u201960s, \u201980s, \u201990s, and today. David Baarschers is Fairmont Hotel Vancouver\u2019s executive chef. Born and raised in Vancouver, he owes a lot of his passion for food to growing up surrounded by the rich variety of British Columbia seafood. \u201cIn high school, I had a friend whose dad had a fishing boat,\u201d says Baarschers. \u201cWhenever they came back from the salmon season, they always had a huge amount of prawn. We\u2019d be on their boat cooking them up in a pot of water. The first time I ever sucked the head of a prawn was just eye-opening. To learn that there was just so much you can do with food. It was mind-blowing.\u201d Though a chef does consider peoples\u2019 dietary preferences, a menu is also a reflection of what\u2019s swimming nearby. Baarschers says that when he and the restaurant staff are deciding what seafood to order, they have to strike a balance between availability and customer taste. \u201cWe usually have conversations with our suppliers,\u201d Baarschers explains. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s coming into season? What are you going to be able to supply us in the amount that allows us to put this on our menu?\u201d As warming intensifies, the species in high enough abundance to make it to menus are continuing to change. As Cheung and Ng\u2019s work predicts, local cool-water species such as sockeye salmon will continue to decline on Vancouver menus. (In 2019, British Columbia saw its lowest salmon catch in 70 years.) In their place, southerly species are moving in. One of the most notable of these new arrivals isn\u2019t a fish, but Humboldt squid, which have begun appearing in both fishers\u2019 nets and in restaurants across the city. From a chef\u2019s perspective, Baarschers sees the changes as a mixed bag. New kinds of seafood are exciting to work with, but they come at the cost of beloved favorites. \u201cYou get to know and love certain items, and when they decline and you no longer see the same fish around, it is a bit sad because you just have such fond memories,\u201d he says. The changes could also affect Vancouver\u2019s massive tourist industry, as customers have come to expect certain species on their plates. \u201cEveryone waits for halibut season to come,\u201d Baarschers says. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have halibut on the menu, people are asking why.\u201d","headline":"You Can Spot Climate Change in Old Restaurant Menus","article_name":661465.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/07\/climate-change-vancouver-seafood-restaurant-menus\/661465\/","date_published":"2022-07-02 12:00:00","article_length":5517,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:51.415500","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/07\/climate-change-vancouver-seafood-restaurant-menus\/661465\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A falcon war in Greenland\u2019s frigid north is a preview of habitat contests to come. NUUK, Greenland\u2014Far up the coast of this ice-dominated island\u2014north of the Arctic Circle; north of the glacier that spawned the Titanic -sinking iceberg; and north of the northernmost American military base \u2014two birds of prey are locked in a vicious battle for food and territory. Kurt Burnham has spent the past decade watching the fight take shape. He studies falcons at the High Arctic Institute, in Orion, Illinois, and he has traveled to Greenland most of the summers of his life. For many of those trips, he helped survey peregrine falcons that use western Greenland as a summer nesting ground. But about a decade ago, he began tracking something new. As climate change tempered the Arctic\u2019s frigid summers, peregrines were expanding their range north\u2014farther north, he found, than there were ever records of them traveling before. Peregrine pairs began returning, summer after summer, to nest on the island\u2019s northernmost cliffs. They were not alone there. Another bird of prey, the gyrfalcon, has nested on the same cliffs for millennia. Though it is specially adapted for high-Arctic life, and larger than the peregrine, this gentler and more conflict-averse bird is not prepared to compete with peregrines. Now, the peregrines regularly attack and overwhelm the gyrs. The fight previews battles to come on a fast-warming planet. Global warming can sometimes sound like a passive phenomenon\u2014as if wild animals just wake up one day to discover that the air is hotter and all their food is gone. But Greenland\u2019s peregrine-gyr war suggests that the upheavals to come will be bloody ones. Climate change is not only triggering a kind of slow ecological impoverishment, but also bringing very real, very fast invasions. Burnham is not optimistic about the contest between peregrines and gyrfalcons. \u201cOver the next 10 to 15 years,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll probably see one of them go extinct in the area.\u201d There are few greater environmental success stories than that of the peregrine falcon. Once widespread across North America, peregrine populations were devastated by the widespread introduction of the pesticide DDT in the 1950s. The chemical dispersed through the ecosystem and built up in the bodies of apex predators like peregrine falcons and bald eagles. It weakened female peregrines\u2019 ability to create strong egg shells: When they were able to lay eggs at all, they sometimes crushed them under their own weight. Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 book, Silent Spring, brought mass public attention to the crisis and helped spark the modern environmental movement. The U.S. government banned the chemical in 1972. The quest to save peregrines began around the same time\u2014and Burnham basically grew up inside it. In 1970, Tom Cade, a professor at Cornell University, founded the Peregrine Fund specifically to help conserve the endangered birds. Cade recruited one of his students, William Burnham\u2014Kurt\u2019s father\u2014to accompany him on a trip to Greenland. Burnham stuck around, as did his soon-to-be wife, Pat Burnham. In May 1975, the month that Kurt was born, the first falcons were hatching from the Peregrine Fund\u2019s catch-and-breed program. William Burnham ultimately led the Peregrine Fund and the World Center for Birds of Prey for more than two decades. While the Peregrine Fund worked on catch-and-breed programs in North America, the Burnhams\u2019 trips to Greenland were limited to observation. Kurt or his father returned to western Greenland every year between 1972 and 1999, counting the peregrine and gyrfalcon nests they saw there. They watched a remarkable recovery. When the elder Burnham and his colleagues first visited western Greenland, in 1972, they found eight peregrine nests and considered the local population healthy. (At that time there were zero peregrine nests in the eastern United States.) In 1999, the year that peregrines were removed from the endangered species list, the Burnhams found more than 170 nests across the island. Now, thanks to warmer summers, the bird\u2019s profile in Greenland is changing again. In 2016, Burnham\u2019s team estimated there were at least 11 pairs of peregrines north of the American air base in Thule. One pair lives more than 150 miles north of the base, and only about 800 miles from the North Pole. Burnham has noticed the change while doing fieldwork in the high Arctic, too. \u201cA warm day meant 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the early \u201990s. Now a warm day means it\u2019s in the low 60s,\u201d he told me. This extra warmth has extended the breeding window for peregrines, letting them survive in Greenland later in the year. That by itself is crucial. As its name suggests, a peregrine \u2014 \u201cone from abroad\u201d\u2014is a migratory bird. Every spring, peregrines fly from their winter nests in the tropics to summer nests in the north. Their range seems to expand on both sides at once. \u201cThe further north a bird gets, the further south it goes,\u201d Burnham says. This means that the peregrines north of Thule have incredible, almost incomprehensibly lengthy migrations. Burnham estimated that a peregrine from northern Greenland migrates more than 8,000 miles south, to Costa Rica, Panama, or Venezuela. Meanwhile, a peregrine falcon who summers in Washington, D.C., might only winter in the Caribbean or the Texas Hill Country. Greenland-bound peregrines also wait until later in the year to set out, delaying their northerly flight until late May or early June. By that time, the Texas peregrines haven\u2019t only made it to Washington; they\u2019ve also laid their eggs and hatched their chicks. If peregrines are the nomadic generalists of avian world, then gyrfalcons are the specialists. With a warm feather layer, gyrfalcons have evolved over the last hundred thousand years to thrive in the high Arctic. Some Greenlandic gyrfalcons may spend the entire year north of the Arctic Circle. They may alight on icebergs, riding them into the open ocean for weeks at a time, leaving them only to stretch their wings or hunt for seabirds. Gyrfalcons don\u2019t build their own nests. Instead, they appropriate other birds\u2019 nests in the early spring\u2014moving into a nest built by a raven, for instance, in the previous year. Gyrfalcons will then return to that borrowed nest year after year. Eventually, the original sticks and mud that constituted the nest are entirely obscured by centuries of guano. \u201cYou see them three feet wide and three feet thick, with no sticks. The guano is just like concrete,\u201d says Burnham. Recently, researchers cored gyrfalcon nests, reading the layers like tree rings. Some of the nests were more than 2,500 years old. Gyrfalcons are raising their young today in nests that are older than the Roman Empire. Except that the peregrines are starting to evict them. Like gyrs, they also move into nests built by other birds, and, as they explore the north, they are finding gyrfalcon homes quite comfortable indeed. And unlike gyrfalcons\u2014large but gentle creatures who will often just fly away if challenged\u2014peregrines are aggressive, defending not only their new nest but also the hunting ground around it. \u201cIt\u2019s an F-16 against a Cessna. In one year, we found a gyrfalcon chick that had just learned to fly, on the ground with a broken wing,\u201d says Burnham. \u201cIt was probably a result of a peregrine striking the gyrfalcon nest.\u201d Global warming may be helping peregrines move north right now, but not all of its changes have been positive for the birds. During the summer, it now rains regularly in Thule\u2014the only precipitation used to be dry, frigid snowflakes\u2014and, across Greenland, both snow and rain seem to be clumping into large storm systems. Instead of seeing three months of rain fall over the course of three non-consecutive weeks, an entire season\u2019s worth of rain will now fall in three hours. All that water, all at once, can pool in peregrine nests, chilling or even drowning the chicks. \u201cFor small, little baby birds, covered in down, the one thing you don\u2019t want is a bunch of rain. It used to be a lot of dry snow that came down, now it\u2019s rain,\u201d Burnham says. Over time, he thinks these large rainstorms could disturb the bird\u2019s delicate demographics. Peregrines generally lay four eggs in a year, and while all four will usually hatch, one or two chicks will die in the nest. If that chick mortality rate rises over time, it could start to curtail the falcon\u2019s population\u2014and its northward expansion. \u201cNo matter how warm it gets, the falcons may not be able to produce enough young to move the population further north,\u201d Burnham told me. Maybe peregrines are just like us: Right now, they\u2019re enjoying all the good parts of global warming. The suffering will come later.","headline":"The Battle Over 2,500-Year-Old Shelters Made of Poop","article_name":534510.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/07\/falcon-battle-over-nests-of-bird-poop\/534510\/","date_published":"2017-07-24 08:30:00","article_length":8699,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:51.726416","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/07\/falcon-battle-over-nests-of-bird-poop\/534510\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"This morning George Will offered another in his series of reassuring columns about the \"overstated\" threat of climate change.\u00a0 Today's version: \"When New York Times columnist Tom Friedman called upon 'young Americans' to 'get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon,' another columnist, Mark Steyn, responded : 'If you're 29, there has been no global warming for your entire adult life. If you're graduating high school, there has been no global warming since you entered first grade.' \"Which could explain why the Mall does not reverberate with youthful clamors about carbon. And why, regarding climate change, the U.S. government, rushing to impose unilateral cap-and-trade burdens on the sagging U.S. economy, looks increasingly like someone who bought a closetful of platform shoes and bell-bottom slacks just as disco was dying.\" Will presented the lack of youthful clamor as a sign of wholesome common sense. If you would like another way to think about the evidence, this one provided not by a columnist but by a physicist at UC Berkeley who has won a MacArthur grant, I recommend Richard A. Muller 's book Physics for Future Presidents . I happened to read most of it on a long plane flight yesterday, so I was all set for Will's column today. So you can be ready before his next one appears, I recommend ordering the book now. Muller says that the evidence behind the hockey-stick chart is wrong. (Read it yourself to see why.) \"In fact, much of what the public 'knows' about global warming is based on distortion, exaggeration, or cherry picking,\" he says, adding: The real purpose of his book is to set out as clearly as possible the way scientists approach the inevitably-conflicting evidence on big public policy issues like climate change (or the real risks of terrorism, or dealing with nuclear waste). Before the Iraq war, it would have been useful for intelligence officials to set out the way they balance their version of inevitably-conflicting and always-incomplete facts. Muller sets out the way climate scientists weigh the evidence pro and con concerning climate change and the probabilities for each explanation. By the end of the process he has forcefully re-established the principle that real scientists view propositions as most convincing when all the doubts, caveats, and contrary bits of evidence are admitted -- whereas politicians and the public want to hear an all-or-nothing verdict with no hems or haws. Consistent with this approach, it is all the more powerful when Muller concludes that there really are reasons to worry about man-made climate change. He also provides guidelines about sensible and fanciful ways to deal with the problem. I am not equipped to judge this argument on purely scientific grounds; but the book is addressed to lay readers and is convincing in what it says about the process of scientific reasoning. If this latest George Will opus serves to drive readers to Muller's book, it will have done some good.","headline":"Compare-and-contrast reading on climate change","article_name":21955.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2009\/07\/compare-and-contrast-reading-on-climate-change\/21955\/","date_published":"2009-07-24 03:12:54","article_length":2999,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:52.542069","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2009\/07\/compare-and-contrast-reading-on-climate-change\/21955\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It's all a matter of how the issue is framed and what values activists appeal to. Both last month's Senate Climate Talkathon and Tom Steyer\u2019s $100 million dollar pledge to back environment-friendly candidates indicate the same thing: Democrats are getting serious about global warming again. But even when Democrats have managed to close ranks behind previous legislative efforts like Waxman-Markey, Republicans have stymied them. Can the left forge a coalition to tackle the problem? The environment was once a bipartisan issue. The 1970 Clean Air Act, the 1972 Clean Water Act, and the 1973 Endangered Species Act were all passed with bipartisan support, as was legislation strengthening those acts in the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, the environment has become increasingly divisive. Data from the Pew Research Center show that the decrease in support for environmental protection is not only very recent but also one-sided: Despite that decline, Republican support for environmental causes is stronger than it might appear. Two Ph.D. students at the University of California Santa Barbara, Phillip Ehret and Aaron Sparks, found that a quarter of individuals self-identifying as \u201cvery conservative\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d support environmental regulations, even if they risk harming the economy. A Yale Study finds that 85 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans favor \u201cregulating CO2 as a pollutant\" and majorities from both parties favor investing in renewable energy. If Republican voters are concerned about the environment, haven\u2019t we seen an action? One explanation is that the framing of environmental issues is often anathema to conservatives. Matthew Feinberg and Robb Willer\u2019s important paper on the subject, \u201c The Moral Roots of Environmental Attitudes ,\u201d finds that liberals view environmental issues as moral concerns informed by a harm principle, while conservatives view environmental issues through the lens of purity, and particularly for religious people, stewardship. In 1971\u2019s Octogesima Adveniens , Pope Paul VI laid out a religious case for protecting the environment, using the language of responsibility, duty to future generations, and purity\u2014in other words, the conservative framing under Feinberg and Willer\u2019s standards: Man is suddenly becoming aware that by an ill-considered exploitation of nature he risks destroying it and becoming in his turn the victim of this degradation \u2026 thus creating an environment for tomorrow which may well be intolerable .... The Christian must turn to these new perceptions in order to take on responsibility, together with the rest of men, for a destiny which from now on is shared by all. In his 2006 \u201cLetter to a Southern Baptist Pastor,\u201d E.O. Wilson showed how to use the religious framing in defense of the environment: You have the power to help solve a great problem about which I care deeply. I hope you have the same concern. I suggest that we set aside our differences in order to save the Creation. The defense of living nature is a universal value. It doesn\u2019t rise from, nor does it promote, any religious or ideological dogma. Rather, it serves without discrimination the interests of all humanity. Pastor, we need your help. The Creation\u2014living nature\u2014is in deep trouble. The environmental movement has stumbled because it has not framed the issue as Wilson and Paul VI did. A 2012 study by Matthew C. Nisbet, Ezra M. Markowitz, and John E. Kotcher found that climate campaigns overwhelming frame the issue in terms of harm and care, fairness, and oppression of marginalized groups. These frames fall into what Feinberg and Willer would consider left-wing frames, alienating conservatives. Adopting a more conservative framing wouldn\u2019t lead to liberals winning more elections. More likely, moderate Republican and centrist thought leaders could make green policy a bipartisan initiative of the sort that was common during the Eisenhower, Nixon, and Bush Sr. days. There are already right-leaning pro-environment groups, like Atlanta\u2019s Green Tea Coalition and Ducks Unlimited. That\u2019s unlikely to be enough to bridge the divide. Because people are more likely to respond to arguments made by someone within their community than outside of it, progress depends on more Republican voices. But Republican thought leaders and policymakers have abandoned the environment in droves. ThinkProgress  calculates that 56 percent of Republicans in the current congress deny anthropogenic global warming. Among the general public , 26 percent of adults don't believe global warming is real (although only 11 percent of Democrats do, versus 46 percent of Republicans and an astonishing 70 percent of Tea Partiers). Deborah Guber, a professor at University of Vermont, argues that there has been a concerted effort among right-leaning elites to downplay the environmental issue. \u201cPartisan conflicts are not inherent in the subject of climate change,\u201d she writes. \u201cParty sorting seems to occur only as citizens acquire information and become familiar with elite cues.\u201d This helps explain the lack of political movement, despite evidence that conservative voters are concerned about the degradation of the environment. Guber notes the infamous 2003 Frank Luntz memo \u00a0arguing that the environment was the issue on which Republicans were most vulnerable. \u201cThe scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science,\u201d Luntz wrote. \u201cA compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth.\u201d Funders took Luntz\u2019s idea and ran with it\u2014with impressive success. A Drexel University study released in December bolsters the idea of a concerted denial campaign led by elites. The survey found that the climate-denial movement consists of 91 organizations supported by 140 primarily conservative foundations. \u201cThe Republicans and (at least a large part of) the business community are against doing anything about climate change, because doing something about it would mean government intervention in the economy, which is ideologically bad but also having tangible and real economic costs on certain segments of the business world,\u201d Benjamin Radcliff, a professor of politics at Notre Dame, told me. Regulating greenhouse gases would hurt some big businesses. If IPCC estimates are correct, some 80 percent of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain unused . That presents a risk for companies like Koch Industries and Exxon Mobil\u2014companies whose donations give them an outsize influence on the political process . Recently, Exxon said it is \"highly unlikely\u201d that governments would implement policies to significantly reduce emissions. (Just to be sure, the company has donated millions to climate denial groups.) Tom Steyer\u2019s example aside, Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page find \u201cthat economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.\u201d And elites are less likely to be concerned about climate change than other citizens. Benjamin I. Page, Larry M. Bartels, and Jason Seawright have found that the issue ranks below \u201cthe loss of traditional values,\u201d budget deficits, and inflation among policy priorities for the wealthy. While the wealthy in their study generally favored reducing spending on the environment (the difference between \u201cexpanded\u201d and \u201ccut back\u201d was -8) the public strongly favored increasing spending (+29). Internationally, the environment isn\u2019t so polarized. Right-leaning politicians like David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy have embraced the environment, and Angela Merkel won reelection in part by promising to phase out nuclear energy in favor of renewables. And within the U.S., some Democratic governors in red states have had success pursuing environmental issues. In Wyoming, the most conservative state in the country, Dave Freudenthal\u2019s administration focused on a long-term strategy for resource extraction that included, among other things, preserving the state\u2019s forests and regulating hydraulic fracking . The result: a reelection margin of 20 percent and a reputation as one of the most popular governors in the country , including 66 percent approval among Republicans. But at the national level in the United States, environmental progress has been stymied by elites with a vested interest in fostering denial and the economic means to do so. This is not an easily surmountable challenge, but the polling reveals that underlying support offers hope for moving climate-change policy forward; and unlike hot-button issues like abortion or gay rights, the policy solutions are well agreed-upon. Yet the environmental movement has not helped itself by framing the issue in terms that appeal mostly to the converted. Activists will find more success if they focus on promoting sanctity and responsibility, showing how protecting the environment is economically beneficial and leaving a legacy for future generations.","headline":"How to Tap Latent Conservative Support for Climate-Change Policy","article_name":360911.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/04\/republicans-framing-climate-change\/360911\/","date_published":"2014-04-18 19:39:06","article_length":9112,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:52.935845","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/04\/republicans-framing-climate-change\/360911\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Best fringe benefit of curbing emissions? A stronger economy. Thanks to the folks at the Climate Desk for bringing this conversation together, and to Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus for their introduction. So much has been written about the inability of policymakers to produce breakthroughs in Copenhagen and Congress that one might think that the only way to address climate change is to pass massively complex bills and treaties. Of course, there are many pathways to cut carbon, and clean-energy advocates in the US have made real progress even as recent legislative efforts have stalled. Knowing there won't be a climate bill anytime soon doesn't mean we have to start all over again. Before I address the huge global challenge that we all know we need to solve, let me pose an important human one. After reading this exchange of essays, please ask the next person you meet these questions: -- \"Does anyone in your family use an asthma inhaler?\" -- \"Is anyone in your family having trouble finding a job?\" -- \"When was last time your family had a discussion about carbon sequestration or cap-and-trade?\" Within those answers is perhaps the most important key to reducing emissions: Politicians and clean-energy advocates must stop talking about policy and start showing people how clean-energy solutions that are available right now will make their lives better. Replacing coal-fired power plants with clean energy is a good example of how attacking climate change at a local level can deliver powerful results. The Sierra Club and a diverse coalition of grassroots organizations have already prevented 139 proposed coal plants from being built. Collectively, these grassroots victories have prevented more than 500 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The coalition is increasingly focused on replacing the nation's oldest and dirtiest coal plants with clean-energy solutions. The approach uses public health laws like the Clean Air Act to force utilities to clean up coal-burning facilities. Then, at the local level, community leaders and energy advocates show how replacing coal with clean energy is actually cheaper, will stimulate job growth, and improve air and water quality. The strong investments in energy innovation that Shellenberger and Nordhaus call for will accelerate this trend, but we're already having an impact even without them: Utilities have identified 10,000 megawatts of dirty coal-fired power slated for closure in just the last six months alone. Earlier this week, Arizona Public Service Company announced it would close three more coal plants, adding another 560 megawatts of dirty coal energy soon to come offline. At least one-third of existing coal plant generation could be retired and replaced with clean energy within this decade. Reaching that goal--state by state and community by community--won't require any new legislation. But it will require popular support. The people living in those communities will rightly demand to see how rather than taking something away, we're delivering something better: clean-energy jobs, healthier communities, energy security, safer drinking water, and cleaner air (not to mention giving ourselves a fighting chance against climate change). Consider Delaware. A few years ago, community groups there defeated a proposal for a new coal plant and then took aim at the state's existing fleet. As part of negotiations to phase out these plants, the company that proposed the plant, NRG Energy, agreed to provide specialized training for current employees so they could transition to work at the planned offshore wind farm or in other clean-energy jobs. This shows we can cut emissions, create jobs, and take care of workers at the same time. The link between politics, economy, and ecology was highlighted on Nov. 2 in California with the defeat of Proposition 23, a ballot initiative bankrolled by out-of-state oil companies that would have rolled back the state's landmark climate bill until unemployment dropped below 5.5 percent for a year. Because we could point to existing green jobs and to industries that the proposition would kill, voters overwhelmingly rejected it. And that's in a state with the third-highest unemployment in the nation. As we address one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced, it's important to remember that fighting climate change isn't just an obligation, it's an opportunity. In Delaware, California, and across the country, voters and policymakers are realizing that we should invest in energy savings and clean energy not in spite of the economic downturn, but because of it.

{"id":null,"body":"On an Alaskan island, one of nature\u2019s greatest spectacles is shutting down, as brown bears abandon fish in favor of a surprising alternative. In the summer of 2014, William Deacy and Jonathan Armstrong returned to Kodiak Island, Alaska\u2014a place where the world\u2019s biggest grizzly bears gather to gorge themselves. Every year, hordes of sockeye salmon swim up from the ocean and fill the island\u2019s streams in a spawning frenzy. Every year, the bears are waiting for them. And every year, Deacy and Armstrong had gone to wait for the bears. But in 2014, the bears were gone. For years, Deacy and Armstrong, both ecologists from Oregon State University, had spent time at one particular stream on the island\u2014three meters across, and only six inches deep. In July and August, its shallow waters turn red with around 60,000 sockeye salmon. \u201cThey\u2019re bank to bank,\u201d says Deacy. \u201c You\u2019d have a hard time walking through the stream without catching one.\u201d The bears certainly have no problem. They kill around 70 percent of the spawning fish, and they focus on the most energy-rich organs. They\u2019ll bite the humps off the backs of the males, and they\u2019ll tear females open to get at their nutritious eggs. The signs of this massacre are evident. The tall grass on the stream\u2019s banks gets so thoroughly flattened by the lumbering bears that it resembles a putting green. Gulls, scavenging from the cadavers, are so bloated that they can barely fly\u2014and are liable to careen into human heads. And bits of shredded, half-eaten salmon float downstream. \u201cIt\u2019s usually terrifying to walk up the streams because you get a sense of carnage just around the next corner,\u201d Armstrong says. But in 2014: nothing. The grass was tall. The gulls were svelte. And the salmon were mostly untouched. Foxes, eagles, and wolves took their fair share, but without the bears, these lesser predators made the tiniest of dents in the salmon population. Most of the fish died naturally. \u201cThere\u2019d be piles of dead salmon, just molding,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cThe bacteria were eating them instead of the bears.\u201d So where had the bears gone? Fortunately, at the beginning of the year, the team had collared around 15 of the animals to track their movements. As the data rolled in, the team noticed that the bears were up in the hillsides, far away from the streams. In particular, they were sticking to land that was covered in red elderberry bushes. And Bill Leacock, a team member from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, noticed that all the bear droppings that summer were full of elderberry skins. Bear scat is a horrendous mess when the animals gorge on salmon, but this stuff was very different in color and consistency. In most years, red elderberries only ripen from late August to early September, at the end of the salmon season. The two food sources don\u2019t overlap, so the bears eat them in sequence, gorging on salmon before bingeing on berries. But, by looking at historical data, Deacy and Armstrong found that this natural timetable has changed. In Alaska, spring temperatures have increased and elderberries have been ripening earlier. In 2014, the berries ripened especially early, bringing them in sync with the spawning salmon. And it seems that whenever both items are on the menu simultaneously, the bears always choose berries. Which makes no sense. Pound for pound, salmon contains twice as much energy as elderberries. If bears are looking to gain as much weight as possible, in anticipation of the coming winter, why would they pick the less calorific food? \u201cAll our conventional wisdom made it hard to believe that they were switching to these berries,\u201d says Deacy. He solved the mystery by talking to Charles Robbins, who runs the Bear Center at Washington State University. Robbins suggested that it\u2019s not the total number of calories in these foods that matters, but the levels of different nutrients. In an earlier study , in which he offered captive bears a varied diet, he\u2019d found that the animals mix and match their foods so they get around 17 percent of their energy from protein. That\u2019s the level that allows them to gain weight most quickly. If they overload on protein, they actually lose weight. Salmon are far too rich in protein\u2014it accounts for about 84 percent of the energy in their flesh. But elderberries, by astonishing coincidence, comprise around 13 percent protein\u2014far more than your typical berry, but almost exactly the optimal amount for a grizzly bear. By focusing on that single food, the bears can gain weight as fast as possible. On average, red elderberries are ripening two and a half days earlier every decade. If that continues, they will regularly overlap with the salmon by 2070, and the unusual events that Deacy and Armstrong saw in 2014 will become the new normal. Scientists have assumed that generalists like bears \u201cwill fare better under climate change because they have more dietary options,\u201d says Stephanie Carlson , an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley. That might not be the case. The bears, Carlson says, are used to \u201criding different resources waves,\u201d bouncing from one high-quality foraging option to the next. If the berries ripen earlier, that might be a good thing, but once they\u2019re done, the bears will have missed out on the earlier salmon pulse. Then again, some of Kodiak\u2019s salmon arrive much later than the main spawning horde. These fish stick to lakes and rivers instead of shallow streams, so they\u2019re harder to catch. But bears could wait until they die and scavenge their corpses. \u201cWe\u2019re speculating, but we think the bears are going to be fine,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cThere are a lot of backups on Kodiak Island.\u201d That might not be the case in the continental United States, where salmon runs are dominated by hatchery-raised fish that all tend to spawn at the same time. So far, no one knows if bears in other states are also abandoning salmon in favor of other time-shifted foods. But \u201cwe\u2019re particularly worried about proposals for large mining operations and other human activities that would reduce the ability of bears to move across the landscape and make use of these backup resources,\u201d says Armstrong. Misty MacDuffee , from the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, also notes that a bear\u2019s life isn\u2019t just about finding food and gaining weight. \u201cMany lines of evidence suggest that bears need the fat from salmon for successful hibernation, and delivery or nourishment of cubs inside the den,\u201d she says. If they\u2019re forgoing this fat for the easy carbs in the berries, are they inadvertently screwing themselves over? And what about the other inhabitants of Kodiak Island? By killing salmon, bears make their flesh available to smaller fish and gulls. By dragging salmon corpses to river banks, bears move huge amounts of nutrients from the sea to the land, fertilising the soil and feeding small scavengers. In these forests, everything from trees to weasels depends on the bears\u2019 annual slaughter of salmon. What happens if that slaughter ends? Many scientists have shown that climate change is rescheduling nature. Warming temperatures are forcing birds to migrate sooner, insects to emerge earlier, and plants to bud and bloom before their time. These changes are disrupting many of the dances between species, forcing long-established partners to move to different rhythms. Flowers, for example, might bloom too early to catch a wave of pollinating insects. But most examples of these \u201c phenological shifts \u201d involve asynchrony between two partners. The case of the Kodiak bears represents \u201can under-recognized phenomenon\u2014that of increasing synchrony of [natural] events due to climate change,\u201d says Nicole Rafferty , from the University of California, Riverside. \u201cAnd the consequences of this shift in foraging behavior could be large with knock-on effects for the ecosystem as a whole.\u201d \u201cSpecies that never lived together can now interact because we\u2019re removing the barrier of time,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cWe\u2019ll see these new combinations that we never thought about, and we\u2019ll get strong responses that no one could have ever predicted.\u201d","headline":"How Climate Change Canceled the Grizzly Salmon Run ","article_name":537483.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/08\/how-climate-change-cancelled-the-grizzly-salmon-run\/537483\/","date_published":"2017-08-21 19:00:00","article_length":8101,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:54.216825","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/08\/how-climate-change-cancelled-the-grizzly-salmon-run\/537483\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The giant mammals are extremely vulnerable to changes in the ecosystem, making their health a good barometer for the state of the environment. They stood on the top bridge of the cruise ship National Geographic Explorer , peering through binoculars at the vast icy Weddell Sea. It was a summer afternoon in February in Antarctica, the air a balmy 32-or-so degrees Fahrenheit, and John Durban and Holly Fearnbach, biologists with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, had spotted killer whales in the distance. The only question was, were these the Type B2\u2019s, with their gorgeous gray-and-white coloring and their culinary fondness for Gentoo penguins\u2014one of only three kinds of killer whales found in the Antarctic Peninsula? Or another type of killer whale unique to these cold deep waters? From miles away it was hard to tell. The rest of us spectators on the ship, far from our native habitats of Texas, England, and Kenya, gazed out at the ice floes and the foggy horizon splashed with blue, wondering too. The scientists were on board thanks to a grant from the Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic (LEX-NG) Fund. The fund aspires to protect the ocean\u2019s last pristine areas through research, conservation, education, and community-development projects in the company\u2019s far-flung destinations. For Durban and Fearnbach, who are based in sunny La Jolla, California, the fund has buoyed their research in Antarctica. While they also study orca and humpback whale populations in the Pacific Northwest, the North Atlantic and Alaska, on these trips they\u2019ve been able to observe killer whales in perhaps the most inaccessible place on the planet. Since 2011, the scientists have made several voyages a year to the frozen continent on the Explorer , using the ice-cutting, refurbished Norwegian ferry to follow the whales. On the trip in early February, the scientists were joined by 148 passengers and a flock of naturalists. For those paying hefty sums to see Antarctica, the 10-day voyage was like a floating science classroom. In the lounge, naturalists lectured on such pertinent topics as \u201cKnow Your Penguins,\u201d \u201cWhat Does Ice Tell Us About Climate Change?\u201d and a Belgian expedition\u2019s epic discovery of the Gerlache Strait. Durban and Fearnbach gave several talks about their work in Antarctica, and how the health of killer whales is a barometer of the continent\u2019s rapidly changing environment. Their research has been especially revelatory. Until as little as 20 years ago, scientists used to believe that Antarctic killer whales were all alike. But Durban, his colleague Bob Pitman and others took small skin samples of whales, analyzed their DNA, and ended up discovering that there are five distinct types, each with its own prey preferences, hunting techniques, and habitats. Durban and his colleagues are proposing that they may be separate species. This means that each type of killer whale will adapt to climate change in different ways\u2014some likely better than others\u2014largely depending on their food supply. The enormous Type A\u2019s, which are a striking black and white, feed on minke whales and perhaps elephant seals. The B2\u2019s, which are the smallest and most plentiful, typically frequent the Gerlache Strait, munching on gentoo and chinstrap penguins and probably fish. The B1s, which are a dazzling gray and white, dine on seals. When they hunt, the clever whales band together and literally make waves to wash seals off ice floes. \u201cThey are my favorite animals,\u201d said Durban during their talk. It\u2019s not exactly easy to spot killer whales in the Antarctic seas, where the horizon can be an endless expanse of whites and grays and mesmerizing teal-blue ice sculptures. The creatures are mostly underwater, and race through the seas at a brisk 55 miles per hour. When Durban and Fearnbach do spy them, or get a tip from the sharp-eyed crew on the bridge that whales are in sight, the scientists chase after them in a Zodiac\u2014a small, black rubber motorboat\u2014taking photographs and collecting data. The photos help them identify individual whales and keep close track of their health from year to year. They can also pinpoint where in the vast Antarctic waters the whales are most likely to be, and how stable the various populations are. Although they already know a lot, they want to learn more about what the insatiable animals eat. That will tell them if the warming environment is threatening their food sources. There\u2019s abundant enthusiasm for their research on the ship. Passengers and naturalists have contributed thousands of photographs of killer whales to the scientists. Counting their own photographs snapped from the Zodiac and from the Explorer\u2019s decks and bow, they\u2019ve amassed nearly 80,000 images of the little-observed animals. In the past six years, they\u2019ve gained tremendous insights into the enigmatic cetaceans. Using tiny satellite tags affixed to whales that relay their movements, Durban and Fearnbach were the first to document Antarctic whales making a speedy, 5,000-mile trip to the warmer waters of the subtropics and back, apparently to shed their algae-encrusted skin. They recorded the deepest dives\u2014more than 2,000 feet\u2014of any killer whales in the world. They\u2019ve seen feeding behaviors few scientists have: a killer whale dangling an elephant seal in its mouth, another type of killer whale pursuing pretty Ad\u00e9lie penguins. In early February, the researchers had already been out for two weeks traversing the Southern Ocean and Weddell Sea, where Ernest Shackleton\u2019s ship Endurance famously got trapped in ice in 1915, trying to fathom more about the role of killer whales in the continent\u2019s rapidly warming environment.\u00a0 With news of the ever-widening crack in the nearby Larsen C ice shelf , their quest seemed especially relevant. Larsen C, a mass of ice the size of Vermont and New Hampshire, is melting because of warming from climate change. Because killer whales need sea ice to survive, this means their habitat is changing in profound ways. Durban and Fearnbach were eager to answer some vital questions. How healthy were the Antarctic whales? What were they feeding on? How much prey were they eating? Were the researchers seeing animals they\u2019d photographed in previous years? Or had some whales vanished, perhaps died? These questions matter because killer whales are easily affected by changes in their environment, and heavily shape it, too. Killer whales live as long as humans do, but produce very few calves; each one\u2019s survival is critical. As the continent\u2019s top predator, they\u2019re especially vulnerable to changes in the food chain, like contaminants, or overfishing of krill, a pink, shrimp-like crustacean that humpback whales and other species devour. \u201cIn order for them to be healthy, the ecosystem needs to be healthy,\u201d said Durban. They also eat a ton, so they exert a huge influence on Antarctica\u2019s spectacular array of marine life, including Weddell seals, minke whales, and several species of penguins. As the climate changes, the researchers are trying to understand how killer whales are affecting prey populations. That afternoon when they spied the roaming whales, they dashed inside and approached Captain Oliver Kruess. Did they have time to go out in a Zodiac and take photographs? The ship was on a strict schedule, set to be at Mikkelson Harbor, which was hours away on the east side of the Peninsula, by morning. There was some negotiating among the scientists, the captain, and the ship\u2019s expedition leader, Lucho Verdesoto Yumiseba, who was in charge of the daily itinerary. The researchers were told they had 45 minutes. Kruess, who saw the whales go, gave them some handy navigation advice. \u201cIt was a great example of the support we get on the ship,\u201d said Durban. \u201cWe almost didn\u2019t have time.\u201d They scrambled into a Zodiac with their colleague, Leigh Hickmott, and shot out from the starboard side toward the whales. A gaggle of passengers in orange hooded parkas lined the decks and bow in the freezing air, taking photos. Soon after they launched, they made a thrilling discovery. The seven whales were not B2\u2019s, but the even more elusive Type B1\u2019s. During two expeditions in the previous weeks, they had not seen them once. \u201cThey are probably the hardest killer whales to find in the world,\u201d said Durban. \u201cThey live in the pack ice, so it\u2019s hard to go where they live. They can do 150 miles a day.\u201d While the Zodiac idled, they launched an unmanned hexacopter into the sky. \u00a0The high-tech drone, which is outfitted with a tiny camera, resembled a toy. Fearnbach, her head under a \u201clucky\u201d towel that\u2019s been with them all over the world, looked at a computer monitor, guiding Durban as he flew the hexacopter 100 feet above the whales, taking pictures. The drone carries an altimeter to record height, so they can scale photographs with startling precision to measure the whales. \u201cWe can tell a change in their fatness down to the level of a centimeter,\u201d Durban said. \u201cFor a large whale that might weigh dozens of tons, that\u2019s amazing resolution.\u201d In 2014, they were the first to use an unmanned drone in photogrammetry\u2014the art of measuring animals from aerial images\u2014on any kind of whale. Researchers have long used photographs to identify whales using natural markings; scars on their dorsal fins, the colors of their saddle patches. But the drone has considerably upped their game, enabling them to track individuals\u2019 body condition and growth over time, and get better population estimates. With a grant from the LEX-NG Fund, they first flew the hexacopter in Antarctica in early 2016. Over their three voyages, they\u2019ve taken more than 4,600 aerial images. \u201cWe used to do this kind of work but from a helicopter or a fixed-wing aircraft,\u201d said Durban. \u201cWe\u2019d be several hundreds of feet up so the pictures weren\u2019t as good. It has increased the quality of what we do.\u201d The hexacopter, which is about as light as a toaster and adaptable enough to fly in remote areas, also allows them to collect more data without disturbing the whales. The highly social animals don\u2019t seem to notice it\u2019s there. From that fresh perspective, they\u2019ve seen some startling behaviors in Antarctic waters. Grandmothers giving food to their grandchildren. Sick whales unable to dive, lingering at the surface. Whales swimming close enough to touch. On their first day out the week before, they were floating in the Weddell Sea when they spied something they\u2019d never seen. A group of 25 killer whales\u2014Type B2\u2019s\u2014were rubbing their bellies on icebergs to clean their skin. Because of the freezing waters, Type B whales develop diatoms, a kind of algae that turns their skin yellow. \u201cIt was remarkable,\u201d said Fearnbach. One night, as passengers chatted and sipped cocktails in the lounge, Durban and Fearnbach did a slide presentation. The two met studying killer whales in Alaska in 2005, when she joined his research team. They\u2019re both now 40 and married. He\u2019s tall and barrel-chested with a short reddish beard, while she\u2019s petite with long light-brown hair. As they spoke, the $20,000 hexacopter\u2014nicknamed \u201cChimo\u201d for a white killer whale captured in 1960s\u2014sat propped prominently on a table. \u201cI can guarantee you haven\u2019t seen killer whales like you saw today,\u201d said Durban, showing an aerial photo of the mercurial B1s. Remarkably, little is known about Antarctic killer whales, although they are more plentiful here than anywhere in the world. Over many cruises in the early 1980s, Japanese ship surveys estimated the population at 25,000. But that\u2019s hardly precise. Their research vessels, with good reason, failed to count whales in the treacherous pack ice. Durban and Fearnbach hope to improve the accuracy of the count, by getting abundance estimates in smaller areas in the Antarctic Peninsula. Each hexacopter flight brings new information. Killer whales usually travel in pods of 50, and remain with their family groups their entire lives. By tracking them over time, the scientists hope to discover how climate change is affecting their health. How adaptable is each species to the shifting ice conditions? Some females they\u2019d seen one afternoon were skinny and sick, a worrisome sign. In the lounge, Durban showed a photo of a B1 female and her calf. \u201cOne of the shocking things for us\u2014this whale is very very thin,\u201d he said of the mother. \u201cIt\u2019s skin and bones. It doesn\u2019t have much blubber.\u201d Later, Durban said, \u201cNormally that type of whale is very fat. Immediately when we got in the boat, they were behaving like they were looking for food. They weren\u2019t as energetic as normal. That one female was in terrible shape and couldn\u2019t dive with the rest of the group.\u201d Females care for and feed males and their offspring first, so mothers are typically the last to eat. It\u2019s possible the one female was ill, and couldn\u2019t travel to find more food. Or it could signal a problem in the food supply. On previous trips in Antarctica that season, they\u2019d seen other females in poor condition. \u201cTo me the bottom line is we\u2019ve got to do more of this,\u201d said Durban. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at how widespread that is in the bigger population. Not just one group. We can\u2019t take it for granted they\u2019re healthy. We know we\u2019ve got an ecosystem that has significant changes.\u201d With science funding threatened\u2014including programs to mitigate climate change\u2014Durban isn\u2019t sure how their research will fare. The White House wants to slash 17 percent from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s budget, the agency for which he works. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a great position,\u201d he said. In past few years they\u2019ve had to get creative. \u201cWe\u2019ve become very good at collaborating, seeking diverse funding sources. That\u2019s a model we\u2019re going to have to continue.\u201d As far as the world\u2019s largest predator goes, they have a ton of questions. It\u2019s still unclear what the primary prey species is for Type B2 killer whales. Their previous research has shown the animals frequently dive as deep as 700 meters, deeper even than gifted swimmers like penguins. But what are they eating down there? If the Antarctic Peninsula continues to warm and the ice continues to melt, how will killer whales survive these changes? Already, one of their food sources\u2014Ad\u00e9lie penguins\u2014 has declined in several areas around the peninsula. At Palmer Station, one of three U.S. scientific bases in Antarctica, the Ad\u00e9lie population has been decimated. On the last day of the expedition, the scientists headed out in the glittering waters and ice towers just outside Paradise Bay, and disappeared. Hours later, they appeared in the gray early evening off the bow near a pod of Type B2\u2019s. A sea of dark fins knifed through the black water, eliciting gasps, as passengers on the bridge counted them aloud. Later, securely back onboard, Durban and Fearnbach announced the final tally. There were 40 in the pod, a reassuringly healthy number.

Usually, a story like this starts with a quick roundup of alarming statistics and a reminder of all the latest climate disasters: heat domes, floods, hurricanes, etc. I\u2019m going to skip that part. Most of us get it already. We understand with our rational minds that the climate is changing, and we feel that it is changing in the deepest pit of our gut, where dread and fury live. A poll conducted by Yale and George Mason University researchers in September found that 70 percent of Americans are worried about climate change, and 47 percent describe themselves as \u201cangry\u201d about it. I\u2019m in both of those groups. In my 15 years as an environmental journalist, I\u2019ve always been able to ground myself on a bedrock optimism that humanity will get its act together. Lately, though, as the pandemic has dragged toward its third year, the West has continued to burn, drought has parched my part of the world, and climate action has stalled at the federal level even with Democrats in control, that has changed. I am burned out. For some people, this might manifest as fatigue, or disengagement. For me, it\u2019s anger. On a near-daily basis, I can feel my blood sizzling in my veins. Living in the era of climate change makes us feel lots of things: guilt for our own part in heating the planet, grief for what we have lost and will lose, fear about the future\u2014and anger at selfish decisions made by the powerful people who got us to this moment. How do those who think about climate change every day keep getting up every morning? Taking care of their mind and body is a priority for all of the people I spoke with for this story, but so was something else: using their anger. \u201cThere\u2019s always either a slow burn of anger and, like, a raging fire of sadness, or vice versa,\u201d Mary Heglar, an essayist and a co-host of the podcast Hot Take , told me. \u201cWhen I\u2019m deep in despair, I\u2019m doing all the self-care \u2026 but when I\u2019m deep in anger, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to get active.\u201d When she\u2019s sad, like many seasoned climate thinkers, she tries to show compassion to herself. But when she\u2019s angry, she channels that fire toward her writing and podcasts, which share vital information about what is really responsible for the mess we find ourselves in. (Hint: It is not your daily commute or even your annual vacation. It is fossil-fuel companies and the politicians who have served them.) \u201cYou got to be petty!\u201d she said, even if that means replying to inane, greenwashing tweets from fossil-fuel companies. \u201cThere is such a thing as righteous anger, because that is not about you and your personal ego; it really is the anger you\u2019re feeling on the behalf of the vulnerable,\u201d Dekila Chungyalpa, the director of the Loka Initiative at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. The initiative is a home for faith leaders who want to engage with climate change. Chungyalpa herself learned about transforming anger into love from her upbringing as a Tibetan Buddhist, as well as from Black women leaders such as the late bell hooks . \u201cThat kind of anger can galvanize and create change,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the trick is to figure out how to direct it in a way that is productive.\u201d If you ruminate on your anger without doing anything with it, it can make you snappish and irritable with those you love; it can boil inside you. It needs an outlet, and what better outlet than activism and advocacy? That means showing up and doing the work: joining a climate-focused organization; donating time and money, if you can spare them; or pushing for climate action at your workplace, church, or child\u2019s school. Doing collective work can also help with guilt\u2014because you are actually doing something about the issue. Leslie Davenport, a psychologist and the author of Emotional Resiliency in the Era of Climate Change , would put this in the category of \u201cexternal strategies\u201d for staying mentally healthy. Note that these are all collective actions, which not only are more effective at stopping climate change than reducing our own emissions, but also place us in community with others who share these complex feelings. You don\u2019t have to jump in the deep end of hard-core activism and protest, Davenport told me. No matter what your current skills are, there\u2019s a way to use them to support climate justice. \u201cDo what you are good at,\u201d Heglar agreed. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do the work, care for people who can.\u201d And collective work can actually change things. The fact that the current worst-case scenario is only a \u201c demi-Armageddon \u201d is absolutely because of widespread social movements demanding action on climate change. Anger can be directed outward in the form of action, but it can still singe the source. People engaged in climate work also need \u201cinternal strategies\u201d for dealing with anger and other intense emotions\u2014what Davenport describes as \u201cmore sophisticated forms of self-care\u201d that can calm our nervous system. They include keeping ourselves physically healthy and well rested, and taking time out with tools such as meditation, exercise, and outdoor activity. For Chungyalpa, who this year is teaching a course on coping with eco-anxiety and climate grief, spending time outdoors in the very ecosystems she is most worried about is also grounding and healing. \u201cThe source of the greatest suffering is the source of your greatest strength,\u201d she said. For Sarah Myhre, a paleoclimatologist who trains early-career scientists to be climate leaders, making prints on the subject of climate change has proved deeply therapeutic\u2014it allows her a contemplative space to feel her feelings but also an opportunity to create a physical object that externalizes those feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it is sitting inside me anymore,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt feels lighter.\u201d Some (including me) may also need therapy or medication to cope with their rage\u2014even if that rage is rational and justified. Employing such internal strategies makes sense, but the fact that we need them makes me furious all over again. We shouldn\u2019t all have to be investing time in complex coping techniques to keep ourselves from exploding with rage or going numb with despair. Advice on burnout often stresses that you can\u2019t fix it with self-care\u2014that you have to fix your working conditions. But what if the conditions causing burnout are a global pattern of fossil-fuel-based capitalism? Davenport has said that climate change, an ever-present crisis, causes \u201cambient anxiety\u201d that raises our background levels of tension and worry. But the pandemic is also causing ambient anxiety. For people of color, racism does the same, every day. For Indigenous people, colonialism exists as a constant present-tense stressor as well. Poverty creates an immense burden of ambient anxiety. Many activists are thus working under \u201cambient\u201d stress levels that no amount of coping techniques can neutralize. The paradox of working toward a just, truly sustainable society is that you have to do it in an unjust, toxic one that makes both the fight and just living needlessly hard. Anger can fuel action, but we can\u2019t live on rage alone. I asked everyone I interviewed for this story to tell me about a moment of happiness or joy they had experienced recently. Myhre talked about the physical pleasure of skiing. For Chungyalpa, it was watching some dogs \u201cjust gamboling in the snow.\u201d For Davenport, it was spending time with her grandchildren. For Heglar, it was walking the streets of New Orleans shortly after moving there this year. \u201cI was so giddy and euphoric to be here,\u201d she said. In all of these cases, joy was felt not as a sense of contentment with the overall state of things, because the overall state of things is messed up. But even in crisis, joy presents itself as sparkling moments, experienced as what Davenport calls \u201ca visceral quality of aliveness.\u201d Allowing ourselves to be energized by these moments without guilt is important. No one is going to fix climate change by being bummed about it 24 hours a day. That\u2019s not how it works. We should accept joy when it comes and enjoy it without a particle of guilt. But if we don\u2019t feel a lot of overall hope right now, that\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need optimism or hope to keep showing up for climate work. We can do it out of pure spite if we need to until our optimism returns. Even as I work on my own burnout, I plan to stay mad.","headline":"The Utility of White-Hot Rage","article_name":621358.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/01\/why-im-staying-angry-about-climate-change\/621358\/","date_published":"2022-01-25 12:00:00","article_length":8463,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:55.467985","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/01\/why-im-staying-angry-about-climate-change\/621358\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The system of government gets in the country\u2019s way. The federal government released a devastating report last week documenting the immense economic and human cost that the U.S. will incur as a result of climate change. It warns that the damage to roads alone will add up to $21 billion by the end of the century. In certain parts of the Midwest, farms will produce 75 percent less corn than today, while ocean acidification could result in $230 billion in financial losses. More people will die from extreme temperatures and mosquito-borne diseases. Wildfire seasons will become more frequent and more destructive. Tens of millions of people living near rising oceans will be forced to resettle. The findings put the country on notice, once again, that doing nothing is a recipe for disaster. Yet odds are that the federal government will, in fact, do nothing. It\u2019s tempting to blame inaction on current political conditions, like having a climate change denier in the White House or intense partisan polarization in Washington. But the unfortunate reality is that American politicians have never been good at dealing with big, long-term problems. Lawmakers have tended to act only when they had no other choice. Read: A disaster of our own making It took a brutal Civil War to end slavery. Bankers avoided regulation until the financial system totally collapsed in the early 1930s. Americans saw southern police brutality on their television sets before civil-rights legislation could get through Congress. Widespread dissatisfaction with the health-care system has resulted in only a patchwork solution (the Affordable Care Act). Mass shootings have still not yielded effective gun control. Why does America so often play catch-up? The problem, I submit, is America\u2019s system of government. The separation of powers, which ensures that no single part of the government can ever achieve unified control of the policymaking process, has been a blessing and a curse. It prevents tyranny but creates veto points for politicians who, for whatever reason, wish to stop federal solutions to long-term challenges. Opponents driven by the desire to defend the status quo can always find different bases in the government from which to pursue their agenda and block forward-looking legislation. Even when there is substantial majority support for tackling big problems, such as gun violence and climate change today, political minorities who disagree with their neighbors can count on the system to help them. There are a lot more people in California (where climate legislation is popular) than West Virginia (where the coal industry still dominates government), but both states send two representatives to the U.S. Senate. Smaller, rural states\u2014whose residents may be less likely to endorse regulation of industry\u2014 are disproportionately powerful in the Electoral College. Not only is the American government separated and fragmented, but private interest groups hold tremendous sway. Through lobbying and campaign contributions, outside actors like the Koch brothers can make it painful for politicians to support beneficial, even popular policies\u2014including climate change regulation\u2014 that would hurt their private interests. When President Carter pushed for a bold energy conservation program in the late 1970s, he ran directly into fossil fuel industry representatives who had little appetite for what he was selling. Read: Gadgets for the climate hellscape American anti-intellectualism stands in the way of change, too. The historian Richard Hofstadter famously accused Americans of harboring \u201cresentment of the life of the mind, and those who are considered to represent it.\u201d The cultural suspicion of expertise has only become worse since 1963, when Hofstadter published Anti-Intellectualism in American Life ; politicians now, including the president, feel no shame at all about dismissing expert opinion. Perhaps as influential as anti-intellectualism is anti-statism: the resistance to strong government, and accompanying confidence in the private marketplace, which hampers lawmakers\u2019 ability to mobilize support for the large-scale regulations or programs needed to tackle big challenges. One last obstacle is American Exceptionalism \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is immune from the same kinds of problems that face other comparable countries. There is a misplaced sense of confidence that the scariest predictions just won\u2019t come to pass here; the U.S. will always find a way to avoid the disasters other nations face. Somehow America\u2019s scientists and business leaders will figure a way out. The belief in American Exceptionalism also pushes many American leaders to resist the kind of international agreements\u2014such as the Kyoto Pact on Global Warming and the Paris Climate Agreement\u2014that are the path to real progress. Those who feel that America is different and superior than the rest of the world are reluctant to concede that it can\u2019t do whatever it wants, on its own. Read: The souring of American exceptionalism None of these features of American politics will disappear; they are deeply rooted in the country\u2019s Constitution and its history. Freshman Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can call for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d\u2014but she will encounter the same intense resistance that President Obama encountered when he lobbied for the same, and with the power of the presidency behind him. The way out is through grassroots activism. Civil-rights legislation seemed impossible until it wasn\u2019t. Health care legislation seemed impossible until it wasn\u2019t. Activists keep up pressure on media organizations to cover climate change, and on wavering politicians to rethink their opposition to desperately needed reforms and regulations. Of course the problem with climate change is that there is such a thing as too late. If lawmakers don\u2019t act until the environment degrades perceptibly, then they\u2019ve passed the point of no return.","headline":"Why the U.S. Can\u2019t Solve Big Problems","article_name":576802.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2018\/11\/us-bad-big-problems-like-climate-change\/576802\/","date_published":"2018-11-28 14:34:24","article_length":5943,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:56.009958","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2018\/11\/us-bad-big-problems-like-climate-change\/576802\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"District attorney in Massachusetts dismisses charges against activists, citing threat of global warming. When two environmental activists used a lobster boat to block a shipment of coal to a power plant, they planned to cite the urgency of climate change to justify their actions if the case went to trial. As it turns out, a Massachusetts county was one step ahead of them. Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter announced Monday that he had reached a deal to dismiss or downgrade the charges against the two activists because of the need to address climate pollution. \"Climate change is one of the gravest crisis [sic] our planet has ever faced,\" Sutter said in a statement. \"In my humble opinion, the political leadership on this issue has been sorely lacking. I am heartened that we were able to forge an agreement that both parties were pleased with and that appeared to satisfy the police and those here in sympathy with the individuals who were charged.\" Ken Ward and Jay O'Hara had faced four charges following their May 2013 blockade, during which they anchored a lobster boat in the path of a freighter delivering 40,000 tons of coal to the Brayton Point power plant in Massachusetts, delaying the shipment for a day. Ward and O'Hara\u2014who bedecked their boat with a banner reading \"#coalisstupid\" and another with the logo of the green group 350.org\u2014said the blockade was meant to show that bold action was needed to combat climate change. The two also prepared a novel defense for their trial: They didn't dispute the facts of their blockade, but instead sought to \"prove the necessity of their doing so,\" according to their website . They were set to argue that the \"urgency and necessity of dramatic steps to curb carbon pollution to mitigate the global climate crisis\" justified their actions. It's unclear how far the \"necessity\" defense would have taken them. In a piece for The Boston Globe , Harvard law student Joseph Hamilton pointed to historic examples of the defense, including the San Francisco mayor who in 1920 was found not liable for destroying several homes to combat a raging fire. Activists on issues from nuclear power to abortion had mounted the defense to mixed results in recent decades. Massachusetts courts require that defendants prove \"clear and imminent danger,\" that the actions \"would be effective in directly reducing or eliminating the danger,\" and that there was \"no legal alternative which would have been effective\" to combat the danger. Ward and O'Hara said that their case would have explained why \"legal avenues are inadequate to address this threat\" and told \"a story which emboldens and energizes the climate movement.\" The trial, however, is off after the county reached a deal to drop or downgrade the charges, although Ward and O'Hara will be required to pay restitution to the town of Somerset, where the coal plant is based. In a statement, Ward said that Sutter had \"in effect accepted our necessity defense,\" calling it a victory for the environmental movement. \"Protest works, indeed protest may be the only thing that can save us,\" he added. Sutter, who unsuccessfully sought a congressional seat in 2012, used the deal to position himself as tough on climate, saying that the district attorney's office would \"take a leadership role on this issue.\" According to a transcript, he also spoke to supporters outside the courtroom brandishing a copy of Rolling Stone with an article by Bill McKibben on climate change. (McKibben, a Middlebury College professor and environmental activist, had been scheduled to testify at the trial.) Sutter said that he would join environmentalists at the People's Climate March this month in New York City coinciding with a United Nations climate summit.","headline":"Verdict: Charges Dropped on Account of Climate Change","article_name":452754.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/verdict-charges-dropped-on-account-of-climate-change\/452754\/","date_published":"2014-09-08 16:19:24","article_length":3750,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:56.958256","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/verdict-charges-dropped-on-account-of-climate-change\/452754\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Since 1972, the giant island\u2019s ice sheet has lost 11 quadrillion pounds of water. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the world\u2019s second-largest reservoir of fresh water sitting on the world\u2019s largest island. It is almost mind-bogglingly huge. If Greenland were suddenly transported to the central United States, it would be a very bad day for about 65 million people, who would be crushed instantly. But for the sake of science journalism, imagine that Greenland\u2019s southernmost tip displaced Brownsville, Texas\u2014the state\u2019s southernmost city\u2014so that its icy glaciers kissed mainland Mexico and the Gulf thereof. Even then, Greenland would stretch all the way north, clear across the United States, its northern tenth crossing the Canadian border into Ontario and Manitoba. Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and Iowa City would all be goners. So too would San Antonio, Memphis, and Minneapolis. Its easternmost peaks would slam St. Louis and play in Peoria; its northwestern glaciers would rout Rapid City, South Dakota, and meander into Montana. At its center point, near Des Moines, roughly two miles of ice would rise from the surface. Suffice it to say: The Greenland Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to refill the Great Lakes 115 times over, is very large. And it is also falling apart. A new study finds that the Greenland Ice Sheet added a quarter inch of water to global sea levels in just the past eight years. The research, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , covers nearly 20 years previously not included in our detailed understanding of the troubled Greenland Ice Sheet. It finds that climate change has already bled trillions of tons of ice from the island reservoir, with more loss than expected coming from its unstable northern half. \u201cThe glaciers are still being pushed out of balance,\u201d Eric Rignot , a senior scientist at NASA and an author of the paper, told me. \u201cEven though the ice sheet has [sometimes] been extremely cold and had low surface melt in the last year, the glaciers are still speeding up, and the ice sheet is still losing mass.\u201d The paper casts the transformation of the Greenland Ice Sheet as one of the profound geological shifts of our time. Scientists measure the mass of ice sheets in \u201c gigatons \u201d \u2014 each unit equal to 1 billion metric tons, or roughly the same amount of water that New York or Los Angeles uses in a year. Greenland, according to the study, has lost 4,976 gigatons of water since 1972. That\u2019s enough water to fill 16 trillion bathtubs or 1.3 quadrillion gallon jugs. That much water weighs about 11 quadrillion pounds. (A quadrillion is 1 with 15 zeros after it .) More worryingly, the paper finds that Greenland lost about half of that ice\u2014roughly 2,200 gigatons\u2014in the years between 2010 and 2018. The ice sheet has also failed to gain mass in any year since 1998. This melting isn\u2019t happening at a steady pace, in other words. Greenland\u2019s demise seems to be accelerating. Think of Greenland as a huge inland ice sea, surrounded by faster-moving ice rivers (which are glaciers) that empty the sea and carry ice to the ocean. The paper finds that those rivers are speeding up, carrying ice out of the island\u2019s core nearly twice as fast now as they did in the 1990s or 2000s. Read: Ancient Rome\u2019s collapse is written into Arctic ice That\u2019s an alarming result, because it means glaciers might now be shrinking Greenland from the bottom faster than hot weather can melt it from the top. And researchers believe that bottom-melting glaciers are less stable and more prone to rapid collapse. \u201cIf there\u2019s a risk of rapid sea-level rise in the future, it will be associated with glaciers speeding up, and not anything happening at the surface,\u201d Rignot said. The paper\u2019s findings are stirring in part because they go much further back in time. \u201cA lot of the publications [about Greenland\u2019s mass] start in 2000 or 2002, some go back to 1992, but this is the first time we go back another 20 years,\u201d Rignot said. Historically, most studies of Greenland combine data from radar flybys, GPS beacons, and laser or gravity-sensing satellites . But there\u2019s not enough data from before 1992 to be useful, so that\u2019s when estimates usually stop. Rignot and his colleagues helped hit upon a new resource. The U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Landsat satellites have circled the planet nonstop since 1972 , imaging every speck of land on Earth every 16 days. This archive\u2014which is a kind of Earth-science version of taking a photo of yourself every day for years \u2014includes hundreds of images of Greenland. Rignot and his team taught a computer how to read those pictures of its icy surface, zooming in especially on the dozens of glaciers that connect the interior ice sheet to the sea. \u201cIt\u2019s looking at two different pictures of a glacier, before and after. [In each frame,] the rocks don\u2019t move but the glacier moves, so it can compare and cross-correlate image points,\u201d Rignot said. \u201cThen the algorithm searches around the window for where the pixel might have gone.\u201d Read: Studying Greenland\u2019s ice to understand climate change The team ultimately used this technique to calculate the speed of Greenland\u2019s glaciers from 1972 to 1992. Then they combined that data with modern observations of the ice sheet to estimate its historical mass. (They used a similar method to estimate Antarctica\u2019s ice loss in a paper published earlier this year .) Rignot and his colleagues relied on another new resource too: OMG! As in, literally, the project is named OMG, short for Oceans Melting Greenland. OMG is a five-year NASA mission , started in 2016, to study how warmer oceans are eroding Greenland\u2019s waterfront glaciers. Rignot helps lead it. \u201cThanks to OMG, we\u2019ve been able to construct a [bedrock] model of Greenland that is pretty good under the ice, and is very, very good underneath the ocean,\u201d he said. Brad Lipovsky , a glaciologist at Harvard who was not connected to the research, said in an email that the results \u201cseem plausible at first glance,\u201d but that scientists would need to carefully check some of the team\u2019s methodology. The overall story of Greenland, he said, is that the ice sheet\u2019s flow is slowly accelerating. This \u201cmakes sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it takes the slowly flowing ice sheet a lot longer to respond than the rapidly evolving atmosphere.\u201d Rignot believes that the new study should make glaciologists look anew at the speed with which Greenland could collapse. The ice sheet\u2019s bleeding-out could eventually raise global sea levels by as much as 25 feet . So the key question, Rignot said, is \u201cHow fast can you make these entities fall apart?\u201d The answer will matter to all of us. The surface of Greenland doesn\u2019t have to move through magic to other parts of the world\u2014already, today, its deluge is on its way.","headline":"Greenland Is Falling Apart","article_name":587431.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/how-much-ice-has-greenland-lost-climate-change\/587431\/","date_published":"2019-04-23 11:00:00","article_length":6804,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:57.170537","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/04\/how-much-ice-has-greenland-lost-climate-change\/587431\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"By completely rewiring the network of animal viruses, climate change is creating a new age  of infectious dangers. For the world\u2019s viruses, this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. An estimated 40,000 viruses lurk in the bodies of mammals, of which a quarter could conceivably infect humans. Most do not, because they have few chances to leap into our bodies. But those chances are growing. Earth\u2019s changing climate is forcing animals to relocate to new habitats, in a bid to track their preferred environmental conditions. Species that have never coexisted will become neighbors, creating thousands of infectious meet-cutes in which viruses can spill over into unfamiliar hosts\u2014and, eventually, into us. Many scientists have argued that climate change will make pandemics more likely, but a groundbreaking new analysis shows that this worrying future is already here, and will be difficult to address. The planetary network of viruses and wildlife \u201cis rewiring itself right now,\u201d Colin Carlson, a global-change biologist at Georgetown University, told me. And \u201cwhile we thought we understood the rules of the game, again and again, reality sat us down and taught us: That\u2019s not how biology works.\u201d In 2019, Carlson and his colleague Greg Albery began creating a massive simulation that maps the past, present, and future ranges of 3,100 mammal species, and predicts the likelihood of viral spillovers if those ranges overlap. The simulation strained a lot of computing power; \u201cevery time we turn it on, an angel dies,\u201d Carlson told me. And the results, which have finally been published today, are disturbing. Even under the most optimistic climate scenarios, the coming decades will see roughly 300,000 first encounters between species that normally don\u2019t interact, leading to about 15,000 spillovers wherein viruses enter naive hosts. \u201cIt\u2019s a little harrowing,\u201d says Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The study suggests that the alarming pace at which new or reemergent viruses have caused outbreaks in recent decades \u201cis not some abnormal situation,\u201d Menachery told me, \u201cbut what we should be expecting, maybe even with an acceleration.\u201d Carlson and Albery drolly nicknamed their study \u201cIceberg,\u201d denoting a huge and mostly hidden threat that we unwittingly collide with. Indeed, their simulation revealed that mammalian viruses have already been dramatically reshuffled, to a degree that likely can\u2019t be undone even if all carbon emissions cease tomorrow. The Anthropocene, an era defined by humanity\u2019s power over Earth, is also an era defined by viruses\u2019 power over us\u2014a Pandemicene. \u201cThe moment to stop climate change from increasing viral transmission was 15 years ago,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world that\u2019s 1.2 degrees warmer [than preindustrial levels], and there is no backpedaling. We have to prepare for more pandemics because of it.\u201d The Iceberg study suggests that new spillovers will follow surprising rules. For example, the team assumed that these events would be concentrated in the Arctic because warming temperatures nudge animals toward higher, cooler latitudes . But if two species move northward in parallel, nothing changes. The real drama occurs, for instance, when animals seek higher, cooler altitudes , and when those living on opposite sides of a mountain meet in the middle. This means that spillovers will be concentrated not in the poles, but in the mountainous and species-rich parts of tropical Africa and southeast Asia. Southeast Asia will also be especially spillover-prone because it\u2019s home to a wide range of bats. Flight gives bats flexibility, allowing them to react to changing climates more quickly than other mammals, and to carry their viruses farther. And bats in Southeast Asia are highly diverse, and tend to have small ranges that don\u2019t overlap. \u201cYou shake that like a snowglobe and you get a lot of first encounters,\u201d Carlson said. Such events will also be problematic elsewhere in the world. In Africa, bats are probably the natural reservoirs for Ebola. Thirteen species could potentially carry the virus, and as global warming forces them to disperse, they\u2019ll encounter almost 3,700 new mammal species, leading to almost 100 spillovers. So far, the biggest Ebola outbreaks have occurred in West Africa, but Carlson said that within decades, the disease could easily become a bigger problem for the continent\u2019s eastern side too. \u201cAnd that\u2019s emblematic of everything,\u201d he told me: Every animal-borne disease will likely change in similarly dramatic ways. These reshufflings are bad news for bats and other animals, which will have to cope with unfamiliar infections on top of the hardships of climate change. Even one newly introduced disease can reshape an ecosystem, and many  such  wildlife  epidemics have occurred in recent decades. \u201cFor species in poor health, showing up in new habitats and being bombarded by disease is probably not good for their conservation,\u201d Carlson said. And spillovers that initially occur between other mammals could someday affect us: The original SARS virus hopped from bats to humans via civets, and HIV reached us from monkeys via chimpanzees and gorillas. For an animal virus to jump into humans, geography, biological compatibility, and other factors must line up in just the right way. Each event is unlikely: Imagine playing Russian roulette using a gun with a million chambers. But as the climate changes, we\u2019re loading more of those chambers with bullets, and pulling the trigger more frequently. Carlson can\u2019t say whether climate-induced viral reshuffling directly led to the current pandemic, but they certainly make such events more likely. The Iceberg simulation also showed that such events will be disproportionately common in areas that are likely to be settled by humans or used as cropland. \u201cSpecies are going to move to spaces that are a little uphill and environmentally stable\u2014and that\u2019s where we have built cities,\u201d Carlson told me. This unhappy coincidence means that the places where their viruses will explore new hosts \u201cjust happen to be our backyards.\u201d Several case studies suggest that the Iceberg\u2019s predictions are just the tip of the \u2026 well, you know. For example, melting sea ice recently allowed a virus that normally infects North Atlantic seals to jump into the Pacific Northwest\u2019s sea otters. But Iceberg, ironically, didn\u2019t consider either melting ice or marine mammals. It didn\u2019t consider birds, which harbor their own coterie of viruses, including several dangerous influenza strains. It didn\u2019t consider potential pathogens other than viruses, such as fungi or bacteria. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re overstating the problem,\u201d Raina Plowright, a spillover expert at Montana State University, told me. The effects of climate change are compounded by habitat loss and other destructive forces in unpredictable ways, she said, which could force species to move and mingle even more radically than Iceberg simulated. This is already happening. At first, Carlson and Albery assumed that the changes they simulated would occur in the later half of this century. But instead, their simulation suggested that we could be living through the peak era of spillovers right now . The problem will worsen as the world warms, but it\u2019s plenty warm already\u2014so most of the predicted viral reshufflings are either happening or about to. And to Carlson\u2019s surprise and dismay, that remains true even if we successfully curb greenhouse-gas emissions henceforth. There are many good reasons to slow the pace of climate change, but the Pandemicene, having been unleashed, cannot be rebottled. The revelations are \u201cso large and heavy to behold that even as we were writing them, we didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Carlson said. But despite every attempt that he and Albery made to naysay their own work, the simulation kept spitting out the same results. They confirm that three of our greatest existential threats\u2014climate change, pandemics, and the sixth mass extinction of wildlife\u2014are really intertwined parts of the same mega-problem. To tackle it, \u201cwe need atmospheric scientists talking to ecologists talking to microbiologists talking to demographers,\u201d Rachel Baker, whose research at Princeton focuses on climate and disease, told me. The study \u201cis not uplifting,\u201d but being informed is useful, Sadie Ryan, a medical geographer at the University of Florida, told me. Efforts to surveil wild animals for worrying viruses can now be targeted to hot spots where those creatures will be, instead of simply their current whereabouts, Ryan said. Artificial intelligence makes identifying the most concerning pathogens easier. Vaccines can be prepared ahead of time, and more quickly than before. But pandemics are inherently unpredictable, and no amount of prevention will fully negate their risk. The world must be ready to meet the viruses that slip through the net. That means fortifying public health and health-care systems, strengthening social safety nets, and addressing all the weaknesses of the pre-COVID normal that made the world so vulnerable to the current pandemic and will leave it susceptible to the next . The world, in its desire to move past COVID, is already forgetting the lessons of the recent past, and perhaps assuming that a generation-defining crisis will occur only once a generation. \u201cBut no, all of this could happen again tomorrow,\u201d Carlson said. And \u201cif this many viruses are undergoing host jumps this much,\u201d multiple pandemics could strike together . Carlson sounded rattled when I spoke with him, his anxiety about his findings cloaked by gallows humor. He told me that the Iceberg study was both the hardest and the most meaningful thing he\u2019s ever done. He and Albery worked on the project from the small apartment they shared during the early pandemic. They kept the bar napkin on which they first drafted the title of their eventual paper on their fridge. The study\u2019s grim results have been a huge burden to bear, but they and their team bore it together. Today, their paper has been published, the world will know, and Carlson will testify before Congress about the need to prepare for spillovers. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe\u2019ll start the project of fixing it.\u201d","headline":"We Created the \u2018Pandemicene\u2019","article_name":629699.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/how-climate-change-impacts-pandemics\/629699\/","date_published":"2022-04-28 09:00:00","article_length":10224,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:58.015489","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/how-climate-change-impacts-pandemics\/629699\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Just because the two powers have every reason to cooperate on the issue doesn\u2019t mean they will. The latest round of international negotiations on climate change, which concluded on Sunday, achieved a significant breakthrough by creating a fund to compensate poor countries for damage caused by global warming. But the two weeks of intense haggling at COP27, this year\u2019s United Nations climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, may focus the attention of the climate-activist community on the United States and China more than ever. The summit left unresolved some of the thorniest issues, including how exactly the new fund will work, and many experts believe that the progress necessary to repair a warming world will be extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, without close collaboration between these two great powers. Lately, that cooperation has fallen victim to souring U.S.-China relations. Beijing suspended bilateral dialogue with Washington on climate in August, and talks were not resumed until midway through COP27 in a meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali last week. Some fears may now be soothed. But the episode confirms the precariousness of the U.S.-China relationship\u2014and, even more, the dangers of relying on continued goodwill between the two countries to solve global problems. In the past, breakthroughs in cooperation of the world\u2019s two largest economies (and greenhouse-gas emitters) have invigorated international efforts to tackle the climate challenge. A pact to reduce emissions that the pair reached in 2014 paved the way for the historic Paris Agreement a year later. Without renewed impetus, some experts worry, the UN-backed process could drift and founder. Read: Who\u2019s really at the wheel of Tesla in China? \u201cThis is a new challenge that we need to deal with,\u201d Li Shuo, a senior global-policy adviser for Greenpeace in Beijing, told me: \u201cHow do we adjust to the fact that the two biggest powers in the world will, like it or not, compete or even confront each other \u2026 but at the same time, there are issues that require their alignment, or at least their engagement \u2026 For a long time, we didn\u2019t have to deal with this dichotomy.\u201d After watching the events at COP27, \u201cI believe even more firmly that U.S.-China engagement is key for climate progress,\u201d Li added. \u201cWithout that, the multilateral process will be paralyzed.\u201d The conundrum is also a huge test for U.S. foreign policy and strikes directly at its greatest contradiction: Washington must protect U.S. national interests from an adversarial China and yet collaborate with Beijing on matters of crucial importance to the country and the world. Much depends on the attitude in Beijing. China\u2019s leaders find themselves in the same fix\u2014compelled to push back against American global power even as they remain dependent on that power to achieve their own national goals. In that sense, tackling the climate crisis will be a test of China\u2019s new role in the world, and what its leaders wish that role to be. President Joe Biden has tried to insulate climate from issues of greater contention in the U.S.-China relationship, such as human rights, technology, and Taiwan . And he\u2019s had some success. A year ago, Washington and Beijing surprised the climate-activist community by presenting a joint pledge to accelerate their efforts on climate, giving the previous UN summit\u2014held in Glasgow, Scotland\u2014a major boost. Recently, though, China\u2019s leaders have tied their continued collaboration on climate more tightly to concessions from Washington on other sensitive issues, most of all on Taiwan. Beijing called off high-level climate talks with Washington in August in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to the island , which the Communist government believed undermined the idea of \u201cone China.\u201d (Beijing considers Taiwan a part of China.) The U.S. government \u201cis very selective,\u201d Yang Fuqiang, a senior adviser at the Institute of Energy at China\u2019s Peking University, told me. \u201cYou think, \u2018On this issue I would like to work with you, but on that issue I don\u2019t like to work with you.\u2019 The Chinese government says, \u2018If you have this kind of attitude, forget it\u2019 \u2026 We think we have to work together in an integrated, friendly approach.\u201d Read: The Paris agreement is working \u2026 for now Some climate advocates in Washington have worried for some time that the planet would be sacrificed to superpower competition. Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, had climate change in mind when he warned last year that it was \u201cdistressing and dangerous\u201d that a \u201cconsensus is emerging in Washington that views the U.S.-Chinese relationship as a zero-sum economic and military struggle.\u201d This, he foresaw , would \u201ccreate a political environment in which the cooperation that the world desperately needs will be increasingly difficult.\u201d John Kerry, Biden\u2019s special envoy on climate, has persistently stressed the importance of China to U.S. climate policy. Climate \u201cis the one area that should not be subject to interruption because of other issues that do affect us,\u201d he said in the aftermath of Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit. This perspective reflects a questionable assumption: that China\u2019s policies are mainly a response to U.S. policies. Yet on many, perhaps most, issues, Chinese leaders have their own agenda, grounded in domestic priorities and strategic calculations, which are largely distinct from its relations with Washington. Climate could well be one of them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the Chinese themselves think they need to cooperate with the U.S. to manage climate risk,\u201d Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate and Security at the Council on Strategic Risks, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that when it comes to climate policy, the U.S. position is really going to drive Chinese behavior.\u201d Beijing has set a domestic target for the country to attain carbon neutrality before 2060, and there are good reasons to believe the leadership takes meeting this goal very seriously. Self-interest is at work. China has an atrocious urban air-pollution problem, which, though improved in recent years, could benefit from reduced use of fossil fuels. Economically, Beijing has long seen new green technologies as a pillar of China\u2019s future, and the government has actively supported the development of solar panels, electric vehicles, and other eco-friendly sectors. Employing such technologies at home also eases China\u2019s heavy dependence on imported oil, helping President Xi attain his goal of eliminating the country\u2019s vulnerabilities to the outside world through his vaunted aim of achieving greater \u201cself-sufficiency.\u201d And the Chinese have already suffered badly from the effects of a warming environment: An epic drought this year dried up rivers and strained the economy of southwestern China. Beijing thus has a strong interest in minimizing the damage to a densely populated, resource-strained nation. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that China\u2019s domestic climate policy is robust and is going to continue,\u201d Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on China\u2019s environmental policy at Villanova University, told me. Chinese leaders \u201care people with a long view. They want to be in power for a long time, they want to have a prosperous and successful country for a long time, so they are very aware of the threat that climate change brings.\u201d Internationally, Beijing\u2019s commitment is a bit murkier. China has already played a significant part in advancing international climate negotiations, and the Communist Party would have a seemingly self-evident interest in taking a lead. With U.S. policy subject to unpredictable changes of administration, climate could be an easy way for Beijing to expand its global influence and \u201csoft power\u201d at America\u2019s expense. China\u2019s leadership has already won global kudos for such promises as Xi\u2019s 2021 pledge to stop building coal-fired power plants outside China. Traditionally, though, China\u2019s leaders tend to be uncomfortable with international entanglements that tie their hands at home, and this discomfort may extend to climate. Joanna Lewis, the director of the science, technology, and international-affairs program at Georgetown University, describes China as a \u201creluctant leader on climate change.\u201d As the world\u2019s largest emitter, she told me, China doesn\u2019t \u201creally want to be in the global spotlight when it comes to greenhouse-gas mitigation.\u201d Bill Spindle: The world has no choice but to care about India\u2019s heat wave Indeed, China\u2019s record on global climate commitments is mixed. At last year\u2019s COP26 meeting, Beijing signed on to a pledge to halt and reverse deforestation but passed on another to reduce methane releases, and worked with India to water down a clause on eliminating emissions from coal for power generation in the final pact. Although China has often championed the interests of poor nations on climate issues, it has also dodged pressure to compensate them for damage done by the impact of rising temperatures.  Li, of Greenpeace, pointed out that Xi may have downgraded China\u2019s global role. In Xi\u2019s report to the 19th Communist Party Congress, in 2017, he said that China was \u201ctaking a driving seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change,\u201d making the country a \u201ctorchbearer in the global endeavor for ecological civilization.\u201d But last month, at the 20th Congress, he said that China would merely \u201cget actively involved\u201d in global climate efforts. \u201cThere has been a lack of initiative\u201d from China, Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, told me. \u201cThere is clearly this ambition for having a more multipolar approach, building a multipolar world order for China to take more of a role in designing and setting the rules in the international order\u2014for which climate is a great opportunity. But somehow, it feels [as though] the initiative to really come up with \u2026 new arrangements, new coalitions under the climate umbrella, hasn\u2019t really been there.\u201d The likely outcome of all of this is that Beijing will pursue its own policy and priorities on climate. In many respects, that course will lead in the right direction\u2014toward reducing emissions at home, where a great part of the fight with a changing climate will be won or lost. That route may also compel Beijing to maintain a dialogue on climate with Washington, even if relations turn even rockier. Perhaps the UN process can act as a platform to keep the two sides engaged. But counting on that would be foolhardy. Washington may need a new climate strategy that is less focused on cooperation with China. Scott Moore, the director of China programs at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of China\u2019s Next Act: How Sustainability and Technology Are Reshaping China\u2019s Rise and the World\u2019s Future , recommends that Washington \u201cstop emphasizing bilateral cooperation and start emphasizing multilateral approaches, which is something the U.S. frankly has never been great at when it comes to China and the climate issue.\u201d He told me that the concept of a Group of Two, or G2, \u201cactually had a lot of resonance in Washington \u2026 the idea that these two big powerful countries could come together and make big things happen. But the reality is that you need [the approach] to be multilateral.\u201d The world may need to move on as well. Obviously, we\u2019d all be better off if the U.S. and China were able to set aside their differences and resolve global problems. But just because the two countries share a common interest on climate, and have every reason to cooperate on it, doesn\u2019t mean they will. That\u2019s true also of other important international issues, such as nonproliferation, global health, and poverty alleviation. In a supposedly multipolar world order, voices beyond Washington and Beijing may need to fill this vacuum, rallying those willing to lead and pressuring the recalcitrant. This may not be the world we want, but it\u2019s the world we\u2019ve got.","headline":"Where U.S.-China Competition Leaves Climate Change","article_name":672170.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2022\/11\/us-china-relations-climate-change\/672170\/","date_published":"2022-11-21 12:00:00","article_length":12002,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:58.649050","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2022\/11\/us-china-relations-climate-change\/672170\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Especially in private, she sounds a lot like \u2026 a teenager. In a very short time, Greta Thunberg\u2014with her searing stare, Pippi Longstocking braids, and hand-painted sign reading SKOLSTREJK F\u00d6R KLIMATET \u2014 has become a global icon. A year ago, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist began striking from school each Friday to protest climate inaction; last Friday, she gave a speech to hundreds of thousands of people in New York, at the Global Climate Strike, which was inspired by her protest. It is always at least a little unfortunate to see a young person become an icon\u2014it robs them of the privacy of growing up. But Thunberg is an especially flummoxing figure. She looks younger than her years, yet her speeches take a shaming, authoritative tone that is, at the very least, unusual for a child. \u201cHow dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood,\u201d she told world leaders at the United Nations today . She has also said that money and eternal economic growth are \u201cfairy tales.\u201d So she has inspired both public adoration and malign theorizing (mostly centered around the power of her parents). Last week I had the chance to meet the girl behind the image. She is, thankfully, still a person. And she is even more than that: She\u2019s a teenager. In fact, I think her extreme teenager-ness may be key to her influence. Thunberg and a handful of other young climate activists were receiving the Ambassador of Conscience Award from Amnesty International in Washington, D.C., last Monday. In the past 17 years, Amnesty has given the award to other icons: Nelson Mandela, Colin Kaepernick, and Ai Weiwei. Backstage, grizzled men in their 40s exchanged boisterous handclasps. Interns and assistants buzzed around: anxious, helpful, and attuned to hierarchy. Somewhere Maggie Gyllenhaal was in a dressing room. Yet when I saw Thunberg\u2014in jeans, sneakers, and a pink tank top\u2014she seemed small, quiet, and somewhat overwhelmed. Thunberg has Asperger\u2019s, which she calls her \u201csuperpower,\u201d and which she says allows her to be more direct and straightforward about climate change. Read: Greta Thunberg is right to panic When we got to a room apart from the hubbub, I asked her how she was managing the onslaught of attention. \u201cWhen I am around too many people, I just shut off my brain, in a way to not get too tired, because I cannot take everything in,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be the center of attention; I don\u2019t like that. I have to tell myself it\u2019s for a good cause. I am trying to say something with all this attention, to use my platform to do something good.\u201d Her answers were direct but earnest. She sometimes searched for an English word. Unlike politicians and book-touring authors who have been brain-poisoned by media training, she answered the questions posed. When I asked whether there was a climate fact that caused her particular worry, she frowned and first said she could not think of any one fact in particular. Then she added that she was worried about what she\u2019d heard would be in the upcoming UN Intergovernmental Panel report on sea-level rise. Same, Greta. She is strikingly nonradical, at least in tactics. Unlike other young climate activists\u2014such as members of the Sunrise Movement in the United States, which is led by college students and early 20-somethings\u2014she rejects specific policy proposals such as the Green New Deal, instructing politicians instead to \u201clisten to the science.\u201d She has even declined to endorse a specific platform in the European Union, where her \u201cFridays for Future\u201d movement has taken hold. When I asked how other teenagers should fight climate change, she said, \u201cThey can do everything. There are so many ways to make a difference.\u201d Then she gave, as examples, joining an activist movement and \u201calso to, if you can, vote.\u201d When I wondered aloud whether young people\u2019s rights are underrepresented in the political system, she demurred. \u201cSometimes it feels that way, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problems we care about the most are usually not the ones that are being prioritized the highest. Young people are very concerned about the climate crisis and ecological crisis, and that is very underrepresented.\u201d Photos: Climate-change protests around the world Though perhaps she is moderate in speech, she can be radical in action. Thunberg\u2019s chosen form of protest\u2014a school strike\u2014 is uncommon in the United States , though more popular in Europe. Americans think of school as something that chiefly benefits students, not society; comparing it to a job, where a labor stoppage is a recognized form of protest, is outside our ken. But if you come to see school as part of an intergenerational exchange of welfare\u2014students go to school now, so that in 30 years they can get jobs and pay Social Security taxes\u2014then it aligns well with Thunberg\u2019s overall point, which is that older generations have betrayed young people today by failing to address climate change. This almost economic argument has the virtue of being accurate. And when Thunberg talks about this, especially in private, she sounds a lot like \u2026 a teenager. \u201cWe are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair ,\u201d she said at one point. And this is the way to understand Thunberg that paints her as neither a saint nor a demon but that still captures her appeal. Thunberg epitomizes, in a person, the unique moral position of being a teenager. She can see the world through an \u201cadult\u201d moral lens, and so she knows that the world is a heartbreakingly flawed place. But unlike an actual adult, she bears almost no conscious blame for this dismal state. Thunberg seems to gesture at this when referring to herself as a \u201cchild,\u201d which she does often in speeches. When I spoke with her, I asked whether she felt this dual position: the burden of awareness mixed with the lack of blame. \u201cYes, definitely,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we are so young, our perspective on the world, our perception of the world is so\u2014is so, like, blank. We don\u2019t have that much experience. We don\u2019t say, Oh, we cannot change this because it\u2019s always been this way , which a lot of old people say. We definitely need that new perspective to see the world.\u201d Perhaps that is why adults find her so unnerving. \u201cThis child\u2014and she is a child\u2014has been scared and her parents are letting her be controlled by that fear,\u201d writes the right-wing commentator Erick Erickson , who blames her parents for \u201cdepriving her of a sound education so she can lecture grownups.\u201d Jonathan Tobin, at The Federalist , worries that the shoe is on the other foot: Thunberg has \u201cforced her parents to adopt a vegan diet\u201d and \u201cbullied her mother to give up her career because it involved air travel.\u201d These may seem like exaggerated concerns, but Erickson and Tobin are really just engaging in a great American tradition: In this country, even before we greet you, we ask whether you\u2019re being parented wrong. Other arguments against Thunberg\u2019s rhetoric can and should be made; if she wants to participate as an adult citizen, she should be criticized like one. But in The New York Times , the journalist Christopher Caldwell takes maybe the oddest line of all, claiming that Thunberg\u2019s message is antidemocratic . \u201cDemocracy often calls for waiting and seeing. Patience may be democracy\u2019s cardinal virtue,\u201d he wrote. \u201cClimate change is a serious issue. But to say, \u2018We can\u2019t wait,\u2019 is to invite a problem just as grave.\u201d I want to thank Caldwell, because he reminded me of my own childhood. About 20 years ago, I was at a restaurant with my parents, reading a kid\u2019s science magazine below the table. In a small box at the bottom of the page, it mentioned something called the greenhouse effect, caused by cars and factories. The effect could eventually screw up the entire planet\u2019s environment. My head jolted up. I interrupted my parents\u2019 conversation, which was about something boring, like real-estate prices or which highway to take home. \u201cIs this real?\u201d I asked, pointing at the magazine. Oh yeah, definitely, one of them said. \u201cIs it getting fixed?\u201d I said. No, no, people don\u2019t really know how to fix it. And then I remember feeling something constrict in my chest. It was like the adult feeling of learning that a loved one is in danger, of seeing the comfortable world teeter on its axis. There was a problem with the entire planet, and everyone was just allowing it to go on? In 1999, Caldwell was older than I am now, and the United States had virtually no national climate policy. Since then, I have gone to middle school and high school, graduated from college, moved across the country twice, spent years as a technology reporter, and covered climate change for four years. Since then, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has soared from 364 to 415 parts per million. But since then, the United States still has passed virtually no new national climate policy. Caldwell is right that patience is a democratic virtue. But sloth is a cardinal sin. Perhaps only the young can tell the difference.","headline":"Why Greta Makes Adults Uncomfortable","article_name":598612.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/09\/why-greta-wins\/598612\/","date_published":"2019-09-23 19:30:31","article_length":9064,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:58.993233","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/09\/why-greta-wins\/598612\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Extreme rain, rising sea levels, and more frequent wildfires are all making landslides more likely. It is easy to view the ground as stable, as fixed, as immovable, even when deep down we know that it\u2019s not. Sometimes the earth seems to shudder, as with an earthquake, and sometimes it pops, as with a volcanic eruption . Other times the earth slips, bits of dirt, handfuls of pebbles, beads of water combining and shifting until they coalesce into a cascade that blocks roads, shears homes from their foundations, and claims precious lives. This happened in Ecuador earlier this year, when heavy rains triggered a hillside collapse in Quito, killing at least 24 people. It happened in Montecito, California, in 2018, when a type of landslide called a debris flow killed 23 people. And it happened in the Indian state of Uttarakhand in 2013, when roughly 13 inches of rain caused a slope along the eastern snout of a nearby glacier to fail. That landslide, along with the floods that helped trigger it, killed an estimated 6,000 people. Landslides happen for many reasons, set off by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or human behavior. But \u201cprobably the most common driver we see for landslides worldwide is rainfall,\u201d Ben Leshchinsky, an associate professor in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University, told me. \u201cSay you have lots of rain. What that effectively does is it reduces the strength of the soil. When that soil strength decreases, it can reach a point where it fails, and naturally just slides away.\u201d And climate change is creating more extreme rain events . The 13 inches of rain that triggered the landslide in Uttarakhand was a more than 400 percent increase over the daily norm of 2.5 inches. Rain is why landslide researchers are warning that climate change may make landslides more likely, and that we are not prepared for this growing risk. Read: People deserve to know their houses are going to burn In High Mountain Asia, a landslide-prone region that includes Uttarakhand, climate-related shifts in rainfall will increase landslide risk by as much as 50 percent in certain areas, a 2020 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found. \u201cThese places that were wet and would get the precipitation are now going to get more of it,\u201d Sarah Kapnick, a co-author of the study, said. (Now a senior climate scientist with J.P. Morgan, Kapnick was a research physical scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration when the study was published.) More rain, on its own, might increase landslide risk, but that risk is amplified by the timing of the precipitation\u2014much of which is happening in the summer, when it\u2019s falling as rain, as opposed to earlier in the year, when it would fall as snow. These patterns set the stage not only for more landslides, but for cascading catastrophes. You can \u201cget a rainfall event that triggers a landslide that blocks a lake that causes an outburst flood,\u201d Dalia Kirschbaum, a landslide researcher with NASA and a co-author of the study, told me. An outburst flood is a kind of megaflood, in which water previously held back by either a glacier or glacial deposits of rock and sediment is released. In High Mountain Asia, the large numbers of glaciers and glacial lakes, which form from retreating glaciers, amplify risk, but, according to Leshchinsky, landslides are \u201can issue anywhere there\u2019s basically any kind of relief or pretty steep slopes.\u201d Landslides occur on all seven continents, and in the U.S., they happen in all 50 states. In 2019, the Hooskanaden Landslide in Oregon wiped out a portion of the state\u2019s Highway 101. In 2018, spring was unusually wet across much of the country, so in \u201cplaces like Pittsburgh, the Appalachians in West Virginia, and in Virginia, and North Carolina, there were a lot of landslides,\u201d Jonathan Godt, the coordinator of the landslide-hazards program for the United States Geological Survey, told me. Climate change is heightening other landslide risks too. Longer, more powerful wildfire seasons and rising sea levels both can lead to more landslides. Read: A sicker, poorer, less abundant world Take the 2018 Montecito landslide. Officially, it began early on January 9 when roughly half an inch of rain fell in less than 30 minutes, but the roots of the catastrophe were seeded earlier. In December 2017, the massive Thomas Fire, which at its peak was powerful enough to generate its own weather, burned through trees and other vegetation that could have held the soil back. It likely changed the structure of the soil as well. \u201cWhen the fires burn super, super hot, oils and other chemicals in your vegetation leave almost a kind of plastic-wrap layer on the soil,\u201d Cara Farr, the national coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response program, told me. This phenomenon, called hydrophobicity, keeps the soil from absorbing rain not just at the surface, but deeper. This doesn\u2019t typically pose a problem if the first rainfalls after a wildfire are light: Those drops break up that plasticlike layer, allowing the rain to penetrate the earth. But \u201cif you get a heavy rainstorm after a fire, that\u2019ll drive an increased flooding,\u201d Farr said\u2014and an increased risk of the type of landslide loosed in Montecito. Heavy rains can essentially separate the upper layers of the soil from the hydrophobic layer below. These debris-flow slides are fast-moving, Fausto Guzzetti, who heads the Office of Technical and Scientific Activities for Risk Prediction and Prevention at the Italian National Department of Civil Protection, told me. They start off with as little as a few cubic feet of dirt and other debris. As that mixture of dirt and debris starts to move downhill, it transforms into thick waves of rocks, boulders, and still more debris, traveling up to 35 miles an hour and covering distances of more than 50 miles in some cases. \u201cYou cannot outrun them,\u201d Guzzetti said. Debris flows made up of coarser materials\u2014big rocks and boulders\u2014turn into wrecking balls that can knock cars out of parking spaces and\u00a0 homes off foundations. Debris flows made up of finer material are just as dangerous: They go everywhere, \u201cinto buildings and vehicles and drowning everything in there, including people,\u201d Guzzetti said. After a wildfire, \u201csites are susceptible to debris flows [for] anywhere from three to five years,\u201d Drew Coe, the watershed-protection-program manager at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told me. \u201cIf [in] your first year after the wildfire you don\u2019t get enough rainfall, or if you don\u2019t get an intense enough rainfall, you may not get the debris flow until the second year.\u201d Drought years also mean that the plants that could help anchor the soils don\u2019t grow. And any new fire resets the clock. Places that abut the sea, as Oregon does, are susceptible to yet another risk. Oregon in particular has a lot of landslides\u2014more than any other state\u2014partly because, geologically speaking, it\u2019s a young state, with young rocks that aren\u2019t as cemented or as strong as older rocks. \u201cAnd what that leads to is more landslides,\u201d Bill Burns, an engineering geologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, told me. Oregon also has a landslide \u201ctoe\u201d problem. The term landslide actually has two meanings. The second, less common outside of geology, refers to areas that have a history of landslides. Those past landslides reshape the slope, making it more susceptible to landslides in the future. One feature, called the toe, which marks the end point of a landslide\u2019s moving material, has researchers concerned. Over time, the toe can act as a sort of cork, helping stabilize the rest of the slope. But in places such as the Arizona Landslide in coastal southern Oregon, the toe is exposed to the ocean. And the fear is that, as sea-level rise increases, these exposed toes \u201cbecome increasingly susceptible to increased total erosion through combination of sea level and storms,\u201d Jonathan Allan, a coastal geomorphologist at the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, told me. Rising seas might grind the toe down, making it more likely to fail, and reduce the area\u2019s stability, making future landslides more likely. Rain, wildfire, and sea levels can on their own increase the risk of landslides, but all of these factors can compound. A wildfire could break out on an ocean-facing slide in a region that is also experiencing increased precipitation. And landslides simply aren\u2019t as well understood as other natural phenomena, which is why researchers are now scrambling to better study them. \u201cWe did not have until very recently ways of mapping landslides,\u201d said Guzzetti, noting that the lack of landslide data stands in marked contrast to the global network of seismometers for monitoring earthquakes and floods. Landslides can be relatively small, too, so absent a fatality or property damage, many go unremarked. This is why, in addition to investing in satellite imaging, NASA, for example, has launched Landslide Reporter , which is designed to crowdsource landslide data. If you see a landslide, say something. One more factor, divorced from climate, is making these dangers all the more pressing to address: \u201cwhere people are building,\" Leshchinsky said. He noted that the greatest risk tends to be in developing countries where standards and enforcement on buildings in landslide zones may be sparse. But \u201cthe fact that people are starting to push further and further into what they call the wildland\u2013urban interface puts more people possibly\u2014I don\u2019t want to fearmonger\u2014into these areas that may or may not be stable,\u201d places where the ground might literally slip from beneath their feet.","headline":"A Recipe for Climate Disaster","article_name":629404.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/climate-change-heavy-rain-landslides-flood\/629404\/","date_published":"2022-03-29 12:14:41","article_length":9713,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:57:59.344241","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/climate-change-heavy-rain-landslides-flood\/629404\/","source":"atlantic"}

This article was published online on February 3, 2021. Updated at 1:53 p.m. ET on February 11, 2021. We live on a wild planet, a wobbly, erupting, ocean-sloshed orb that careens around a giant thermonuclear explosion in the void. Big rocks whiz by overhead, and here on the Earth\u2019s surface, whole continents crash together, rip apart, and occasionally turn inside out, killing nearly everything. Our planet is fickle. When the unseen tug of celestial bodies points Earth toward a new North Star, for instance, the shift in sunlight can dry up the Sahara, or fill it with hippopotamuses. Of more immediate interest today, a variation in the composition of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere of as little as 0.1 percent has meant the difference between sweltering Arctic rainforests and a half mile of ice atop Boston. That negligible wisp of the air is carbon dioxide. Since about the time of the American Civil War, CO 2 \u2019s crucial role in warming the planet has been well understood. And not just based on mathematical models: The planet has run many experiments with different levels of atmospheric CO 2 . At some points in the Earth\u2019s history, lots of CO 2 has vented from the crust and leaped from the seas, and the planet has gotten warm. At others, lots of CO 2 has been hidden away in the rocks and in the ocean\u2019s depths, and the planet has gotten cold. The sea level, meanwhile, has tried to keep up\u2014rising and falling over the ages, with coastlines racing out across the continental shelf, only to be drawn back in again. During the entire half-billion-year Phanerozoic eon of animal life, CO 2 has been the primary driver of the Earth\u2019s climate . And sometimes, when the planet has issued a truly titanic slug of CO 2 into the atmosphere, things have gone horribly wrong. Today, atmospheric CO 2 sits at 410 parts per million, a higher level than at any point in more than 3 million years. And humans are injecting more CO 2 into the atmosphere at one of the fastest rates ever. When hucksters tell you that the climate is always changing, they\u2019re right, but that\u2019s not the good news they think it is. \u201cThe climate system is an angry beast,\u201d the late Columbia climate scientist Wally Broecker was fond of saying, \u201cand we are poking it with sticks.\u201d The beast has only just begun to snarl. All of recorded human history\u2014at only a few thousand years, a mere eyeblink in geologic time\u2014has played out in perhaps the most stable climate window of the past 650,000 years. We have been shielded from the climate\u2019s violence by our short civilizational memory, and our remarkably good fortune. But humanity\u2019s ongoing chemistry experiment on our planet could push the climate well beyond those slim historical parameters, into a state it hasn\u2019t seen in tens of millions of years, a world for which Homo sapiens did not evolve. When there\u2019s been as much carbon dioxide in the air as there already is today\u2014not to mention how much there\u2019s likely to be in 50 or 100 years\u2014the world has been much, much warmer, with seas 70 feet higher than they are today. Why? The planet today is not yet in equilibrium with the warped atmosphere that industrial civilization has so recently created. If CO 2 stays at its current levels, much less steadily increases, it will take centuries\u2014even millennia\u2014for the planet to fully find its new footing. The transition will be punishing in the near term and the long term, and when it\u2019s over, Earth will look far different from the one that nursed humanity. This is the grim lesson of paleoclimatology: The planet seems to respond far more aggressively to small provocations than it\u2019s been projected to by many of our models. To truly appreciate the coming changes to our planet, we need to plumb the history of climate change. So let us take a trip back into deep time, a journey that will begin with the familiar climate of recorded history and end in the feverish, high-CO 2 greenhouse of the early age of mammals, 50 million years ago. It is a sobering journey, one that warns of catastrophic surprises that may be in store. Read: Scientists have uncovered a disturbing climate change precedent The first couple of steps back in time won\u2019t take us to a warmer world\u2014but they will illuminate just what sort of ill-tempered planet we\u2019re dealing with. As we pull back even slightly from the span of recorded history\u2014our tiny sliver of geologic time\u2014we\u2019ll notice almost at once that the entire record of human civilization is perched at the edge of a climate cliff. Below is a punishing ice age. As it turns out, we live on an ice-age planet, one marked by the swelling and disintegration of massive polar ice sheets in response to tiny changes in sunlight and CO 2 levels. Our current warmer period is merely one peak in a mountain range, with each summit an interglacial springtime like today, and each valley floor a deep freeze. It takes some doing to escape this cycle, but with CO 2 as it is now, we won\u2019t be returning to an ice age for the foreseeable future. And to reach analogues for the kind of warming we\u2019ll likely see in the coming decades and centuries, we will need to move beyond the past 3 million years of ice ages entirely, and make drastic jumps back into the alien Earths of tens of millions of years ago. Our future may come to resemble these strange lost worlds. Before we move more dramatically backwards in time, let us briefly pause over the history of civilization, and then some. Ten thousand years ago, the big mammals had just vanished, at human hands , in Eurasia and the Americas. Steppes once filled with mammoths and camels and wetlands stocked with giant beavers were suddenly, stunningly vacant. The coastlines that civilization presumes to be eternal were still far beyond today\u2019s horizon. But the seas were rising. The doomed vestiges of mile-thick ice sheets that had cloaked a third of North American land were retreating to the far corners of Canada, chased there by tundra and taiga. The roughly 13 quintillion gallons of meltwater these ice sheets would hemorrhage, in a matter of millennia, raised the sea level hundreds of feet, leaving coral reefs that had been bathed in sunlight under shallow waves now drowned in the deep. By 9,000 years ago, humans in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mexico, and the Andes had independently developed agriculture and\u2014after 200,000 years of wandering\u2014had begun to stay put. Sedentary settlements started to blossom. Humans, with a surfeit of calories, began to divide their labor, and artisans plied new arts. The Earth\u2019s oldest cities, such as Jericho, were bustling. It\u2019s easy to forget that the Earth\u2014cozy, pastoral, familiar\u2014is nevertheless a celestial body, and astronomy still has a vote in earthly affairs. Every 20,000 years or so the planet swivels about its axis, and 10,000 years ago, at civilization\u2019s first light, the Earth\u2019s top half was aimed toward the sun during the closest part of its orbit\u2014an arrangement today enjoyed by the Southern Hemisphere. The resulting Northern-summer warmth turned the Sahara green. Lakes, hosting hippos, crocodiles, turtles, and buffalo, speckled North Africa, Arabia, and everywhere in between. Lake Chad, which today finds itself overtaxed and shrinking toward oblivion, was \u201cMega-Chad,\u201d a 115,000-square-mile freshwater sea that sprawled across the continent. Beneath the Mediterranean today, hundreds of dark mud layers alternate with whiter muck, a barcode that marks the Sahara\u2019s rhythmic switching from lush green to continent-spanning desert. Imprinted on top of this cycle were the last gasps of an ice age that had gripped the planet for the previous 100,000 years. The Earth was still thawing, and amid the final approach of the rising tides, enormous plains and forests like Doggerland\u2014a lowland that had joined mainland Europe to the British Isles\u2014were abandoned by nomadic humans and offered to the surging seas. Vast islands like Georges Bank, 75 miles off Massachusetts\u2014which once held mastodons and giant ground sloths\u2014saw their menagerie overtaken. Scallop draggers still pull up their tusks and teeth today, far offshore. By 5,000 years ago, as humanity was emerging from its unlettered millennia, the ice had stopped melting and oceans that had been surging for 15,000 years finally settled on modern shorelines. Sunlight had waned in the Northern summer, and rains drifted south toward the equator again. The green Sahara began to die, as it had many times before. Hunter-fisher-gatherers who for thousands of years had littered the verdant interior of North Africa with fishhooks and harpoon points abandoned the now-arid wastelands, and gathered along the Nile. The age of pharaohs began. By geologic standards, the climate has been remarkably stable ever since , until the sudden warming of the past few decades. That\u2019s unsettling, because history tells us that even local, trivial climate misadventures during this otherwise peaceful span can help bring societies to ruin. In fact, 3,200 years ago, an entire network of civilizations\u2014a veritable globalized economy\u2014fell apart when minor climate chaos struck. \u201cThere is famine in [our] house; we will all die of hunger. If you do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger. You will not see a living soul from your land.\u201d This letter was sent between associates at a commercial firm in Syria with outposts spread across the region, as cities from the Levant to the Euphrates fell. Across the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia, dynasties that had ruled for centuries were all collapsing. The mortuary-temple walls of Ramses III\u2014the last great pharaoh of Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom period\u2014speak of waves of mass migration, over land and sea, and warfare with mysterious invaders from afar. Within decades the entire Bronze Age world had collapsed. Historians have advanced many culprits for the breakdown, including earthquakes and rebellions. But like our own teetering world\u2014one strained by souring trade relations, with fractious populaces led by unsteady, unscrupulous leaders and now stricken by plague\u2014the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean were ill-prepared to accommodate the deteriorating climate. While one must resist environmental determinism, it is nevertheless telling that when the region mildly cooled and a centuries-long drought struck around 1200 B.C., this network of ancient civilizations fell to pieces. Even Megiddo, the biblical site of Armageddon, was destroyed. This same story is told elsewhere, over and over, throughout the extremely mild stretch of time that is written history. The Roman empire\u2019s imperial power was vouchsafed by centuries of warm weather, but its end saw a return to an arid cold\u2014perhaps conjured by distant pressure systems over Iceland and the Azores. In A.D. 536, known as the worst year to be alive , one of Iceland\u2019s volcanoes exploded, and darkness descended over the Northern Hemisphere, bringing summer snow to China and starvation to Ireland. In Central America several centuries later, when the reliable band of tropical rainfall that rings the Earth left the Mayan lowlands and headed south , the megalithic civilization above it withered. In North America, a megadrought about 800 years ago made ancestral Puebloans abandon cliffside villages like Mesa Verde, as Nebraska was swept by giant sand dunes and California burned . In the 15th century, a 30-year drought bookended by equally unhelpful deluges brought the Khmer at Angkor low. The \u201chydraulic empire\u201d had been fed and maintained by an elaborate irrigation system of canals and reservoirs. But when these canals ran dry for decades, then clogged with rains , invaders easily toppled the empire in 1431, and the Khmer forfeited their temples to the jungle. Hopscotching through these human disasters to the present day, we pass perhaps the most familiar historical climate event of all: the Little Ice Age. Lasting roughly from 1500 to 1850, the chill made ice rinks of Dutch canals, and swelled up Swiss mountain glaciers. Tent cities sprung up on a frozen Thames, and George Washington endured his winter of cold and privation at Valley Forge in 1777 (which wasn\u2019t even particularly harsh for the times). The Little Ice Age might have been a regional event, perhaps the product of an exceptional run of sunlight-dimming volcanism. In 1816, its annus horribilis, the so-called year without a summer\u2014which brought snows to New England in August\u2014global temperatures dropped perhaps a mere half a degree Celsius. While it is perennially plumbed by historians for insights into future climate change, it is not even remotely on the same scale of disruption as that which might lie in our future. As Europe emerged from its chill, coal from 300-million-year-old jungles was being fed into English furnaces. Although the Earth was now in the same configuration that, in the previous few million years, had invited a return to deep, unthinkable ice ages, for some reason the next ice age never took . Instead the planet embarked on an almost unprecedented global chemistry experiment. Halfway through the 20th century, the climate began behaving very strangely. Read: The strange future Hurricane Harvey portends So this is the climate of written history, a seemingly eventful stretch that has really been the random noise and variability of a climate essentially at peace. Indeed, if you were to find yourself in an industrial civilization somewhere else in the universe, you would almost certainly notice such similarly strange and improbably pleasant millennia behind you. This kind of climate stability seems to be a prerequisite for organized society. It is, in other words, as good as it gets. As we jump back 20,000 years\u2014to yesterday, geologically\u2014the world ceases being recognizable. Whereas all of recorded history played out in a climate hovering well within a band of 1 degree Celsius, we now see what a difference 5 to 6 degrees can make\u2014a scale of change similar to the one that humans may engineer in only the next century or so, though in this case, the world is 5 to 6 degrees colder, not warmer. An Antarctica\u2019s worth of ice now rests atop North America. Similar sheets smother northern Europe, and as a result, the sea level is now 400 feet lower. The midwestern United States is carpeted in stands of stunted spruce of the sort that would today look at home in northern Quebec. The Rockies are carved up, not by wildflower-dappled mountain valleys, but by overflowing rivers of ice and rock. California is a land of dire wolves. Where the Pacific Northwest edges up against the American Antarctica, it is a harsh and treeless place. Nevada and Utah fill up with cold rains. During World War II, at Topaz, the desolate Japanese American internment camp in Utah, prisoners combed the flats of the Sevier Desert for unlikely seashells, fashioning miraculous little brooches from tiny mussel and snail shells to while away their exile. The desert seashells were roughly 20,000 years old, from the vanished depths of the giant Pleistocene-era Lake Bonneville\u2014the product of a jet stream diverted south by the ice sheet. This was once a Utahan Lake Superior, more than 1,000 feet deep in places. It was joined by endless other verdant lakes scattered across today\u2019s bleak Basin and Range region. Elsewhere, the retreat of the seas made most of Indonesia a peninsula of mainland Asia. Vast savannas and swamps linked Australia and New Guinea, and of course Russia shared a tundra handshake with Alaska. There were reindeer in Spain, and glaciers in Morocco . And everywhere loess, loess, and more loess. This was the age of dust. Ice is a rock that flows. Send it in massive sterilizing slabs across the continents, and it will quarry mountainsides, pulverize bedrock, and obliterate everything in its path. At the height of the last ice age, along the crumbling margins of the continental ice sheets, the rocky, dusty spoils of all this destruction spilled out onto the tundra. Dry winds carried this silt around the world in enormous dust storms, piling it up in seas of loess that buried the central U.S., China, and Eastern Europe under featureless drifts. In Austria, not far from the site of the voluptuous Venus of Willendorf figurine, carved some 30,000 years ago, are the remains of a campground of the same age\u2014tents, hearths, burnt garbage pits, hoards of ivory jewelry\u2014all abandoned in the face of these violent, smothering haboobs. Ice cores from both Antarctica and Greenland record a local environment that was 10 times dustier than today. All of this dust seeded the seas with iron , a vital nutrient for carbon-hogging plankton, which bloomed around Antarctica and pulled gigatons of CO 2 out of the air and deep into the ocean, freezing the planet further. Read: When a killer climate catastrophe struck the world\u2019s oceans This parched Pleistocene world would have appeared duller from space, hosting as it did a quarter less plant life. CO 2 in the atmosphere registered only a paltry 180 ppm, less than half of what it is today. In fact, CO 2 was so low, it might have been unable to drop any further. Photosynthesis starts to shut down at such trifling levels, a negative-feedback effect that might have left more CO 2 \u2014unused by plants\u2014in the air above, acting as a brake on the deep freeze. This was the strange world of the Ice Age, one that, geologically speaking, is still remarkably recent. It\u2019s so recent, in fact, that today, most of Canada and Scandinavia is still bouncing back up from the now-vanished ice sheets that had weighed those lands down. In 2021, we find ourselves in an unusual situation: We live on a world with massive ice sheets, one of which covers one of the seven continents and is more than a mile deep. For most of the planet\u2019s past, it has had virtually no ice whatsoever. The periods of extreme cold\u2014like the ultra-ancient, phantasmagoric nightmares of Snowball Earth, when the oceans might have been smothered by ice sheets all the way to the tropics\u2014are outliers. There were a few other surprising pulses of frost here and there, but they merely punctuate the balmy stretches of the fossil record. For almost all of the Earth\u2019s history, the planet was a much warmer place than it is today, with much higher CO 2 levels. This is not a climate-denying talking point; it\u2019s a physical fact, and acknowledging it does nothing to take away from the potential catastrophe of future warming. After all, we humans, along with everything else alive today, evolved to live in our familiar low-CO 2 world\u2014a process that took a long time. How long, exactly? Fifty million years ago, as our tiny mammalian ancestors were still sweating through the jungly, high-CO 2 greenhouse climate they had inherited from the dinosaurs, India was nearing the end of an extended journey. Long estranged from Africa and the august, bygone supercontinent of Gondwana, the subcontinent raced northeast across the proto\u2013Indian Ocean and smashed into Asia in slow motion. The collision not only quieted CO 2 -spewing volcanoes along Asian subduction zones; it also thrust the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau toward the stars, to be continually weathered and eroded away . As it turns out, weathering rocks\u2014that is, breaking them down with CO 2 -rich rainwater\u2014is one of the planet\u2019s most effective long-term mechanisms for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, one that modern geoengineers are frantically trying to reproduce in a lab, for obvious reasons. Adding to this colossal Himalayan CO 2 sink, the more recent buckling, tectonic mess that lifted Indonesia and its neighbors from the sea over the past 20 million years or so also exhumed vast tracts of highly weatherable ocean crust, exposing it all to the withering assault of tropical rainstorms. Today this corroding rock accounts for roughly 10 percent of the planet\u2019s carbon sink . Over tens of millions of years, then, the stately march of plate tectonics\u2014the balance of volcanic CO 2 and rock weathering\u2014seems to have driven long-term climate change, in our case toward a colder, lower-CO 2 world. As we\u2019ll see, humans now threaten to undo this entire epic, geologic-scale climate evolution of the Cenozoic era\u2014and in only a few decades. When Earth\u2019s blanket of CO 2 was finally thin enough , the planet\u2019s regular wobbles were at long last sufficient to trigger deep glaciations. The ice ages began. But the climate was not stable during this period. The ice advanced and retreated, and while the descent into the wild episodes of the Pleistocene epoch could be leisurely\u2014the depths of planetary winter taking tens of thousands of years to arrive\u2014the leap out of the cold tended to be sudden and violent. This is where positive feedback loops come in: When the last ice age ended, it ended fast. Coral reefs marking the ancient sea level\u2014but today lying deep off the coasts of Tahiti and Indonesia\u2014reveal that about 14,500 years ago, the seas suddenly jumped 50 feet or so in only a few centuries, as meltwater from the late, great North American ice sheet raged down the Mississippi. When a 300-foot-deep lake of glacial meltwater spanning at least 80,000 square miles of central Canada catastrophically drained into the ocean, it shut down the churn of the North Atlantic and arrested the seaborne flow of heat northward. As a result, tundra advanced to retake much of Europe for 1,000 years. But when ocean circulation kicked back into gear, and the dense, salty seawater began to sink again, the system rebooted, and currents carried the equator\u2019s heat toward the Arctic once more. Temperatures in Greenland suddenly leaped 10 degrees Celsius in perhaps a decade, fires spread, and revanchist forests reclaimed Europe for good. In Idaho, ice dams that had held back giant lakes of glacial meltwater about six times the volume of Lake Erie collapsed as the world warmed, and each released 10 times the flow of all the rivers on Earth into eastern Washington. The floods carried 30-foot boulders on biblical waves, through what were suddenly the world\u2019s wildest rapids. They left behind a labyrinth of bedrock-scoured canyons that still covers the entire southeastern corner of the state like a scar. When the Earth\u2019s climate changes, this is what it can look like on the ground. As the ice sheets of the Northern Hemisphere finally lost their grip, darker land around the melting margins became exposed to the sun for the first time in 100,000 years, accelerating the ice\u2019s retreat. Permafrost melted, and methane bubbled up from thawing bogs. Colder, more CO 2 -soluble oceans warmed, and gave up the carbon they\u2019d stolen in the Ice Age, warming the Earth even more. Relieved of their glacial burden, volcanoes in Iceland, Europe, and California awoke , adding even more CO 2 to the atmosphere. Soon the Sahara would green again, Jericho would be born, and humans would start writing things down. They would do so with the assumption that the world they saw was the way it had always been. \u201cWe were born only yesterday and know nothing,\u201d one of them would write. \u201cAnd our days on earth are but a shadow.\u201d As we leap back in time again, we emerge before the final Pleistocene glaciation. We\u2019ve gone tremendously far back, 129,000 years, though in some ways we\u2019ve only returned to our own world. This was the most recent interglacial period, the last of many breaks between the ice ages, and the last time the planet was roughly as warm as it is today. Once more, the seas have risen hundreds of feet, but something is awry. As the Earth\u2019s wobble and orbit conspired to melt more ice than the poles have shed so far today, the planet absorbed more sunlight. As a result, global temperatures were little more than 1 degree warmer than today\u2019s Anthropocene chart-toppers\u2014or maybe even the same . But sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is now. (A full third of Florida was sunk beneath the waves.) This is \u201csobering,\u201d as one paper put it. Modelers have tried and mostly failed to square how a world about as warm as today\u2019s could produce seas so strangely high. Provisional, if nightmarish, explanations like the runaway, catastrophic collapse of monstrous ice cliffs more than 300 feet tall in Antarctica, which may or may not be set into motion in our own time, are fiercely debated in conference halls and geoscience departments. Very soon, we may well have warmed the planet enough to trigger similarly dramatic sea-level rise, even if it takes centuries to play out. This is what the Exxon scientist James Black meant in 1977 when he warned higher-ups of the coming \u201csuper-interglacial\u201d that would be brought about\u2014as a matter of simple atmospheric physics\u2014from burning fossil fuels. But our trajectory as a civilization is headed well beyond the warmth of the last interglacial, or any other interglacial period of the Pleistocene, for that matter. So it\u2019s time to keep moving. We must take our first truly heroic leap into geologic time, millions of years into the past. We\u2019re more than 3 million years in the past now, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is at 400 parts per million, a level the planet will not again see until September 2016. This world is 3 to 4 degrees Celsius warmer than ours, and the sea level is up to 80 feet higher. Stunted beech trees and bogs line the foothills of the Transantarctic Mountains not far from the South Pole\u2014the last members of a venerable line of once-majestic forests that had existed since long before the age of the dinosaurs. What we\u2019ve glossed over in our journey back to this ancient present: the entire evolutionary history of Homo sapiens , three Yellowstone super-eruptions, thousands of megafloods, the last of the giant terror birds, a mass extinction of whales, and the glacial creation and destruction of innumerable islands and moraines. As we make our way backwards in time to the Pliocene, the glaciations get briefer, and the ice sheets themselves become thinner and more temperamental. About 2.6 million years ago they all but disappear in North America, as CO 2 levels continue their slow climb . When we arrive in the middle of the Pliocene, just over 3 million years ago, CO 2 levels are high enough that we\u2019ve escaped the cycle of ice ages and warm interglacials altogether. Lucy the Australopithecus roams a heavily forested East Africa. We are now outside the evolutionary envelope of our modern world, sculpted as it was by the temperamental northern ice sheets and deep freezes of the Pleistocene. But as to atmospheric carbon dioxide, 3 million years is how far back we have to go to arrive at an analogue for 2021. Despite the similarities between our world and that of the Pliocene, the differences are notable. In the Canadian High Arctic\u2014where today tundra spreads to the horizon\u2014evergreen forests come right to the edge of an ice-free Arctic Ocean. Though the world as a whole is only a few degrees warmer, the Arctic, as always, gets the brunt of the extra heat. This is called \u201cpolar amplification,\u201d and it\u2019s why maps of modern warming are crowned by a disturbing fog of maroon. Models struggle to reproduce the extreme level of warming in the Pliocene Arctic. It\u2019s a full 10 to 15 degrees Celsius warmer in the long twilight of northern Canada, and the pine and birch woodlands of these Arctic shores are filled with gigantic forest-dwelling camels . Occasionally this boreal world erupts in wildfire, a phenomenon echoed by the blazes that today sweep ever farther north. Elsewhere, West Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet may have disappeared entirely, and Greenland\u2019s, if it exists at all, is shriveled and pathetic. A common projection for our own warming world is that, while the wet places will get wetter, the dry places will get drier. But the Pliocene seems to defy this saw for reasons not yet fully understood. It\u2019s a strangely wet world , especially the subtropics, where\u2014in the Sahara, the Outback, the Atacama, the American Southwest, and Namibia\u2014lakes, savannas, and woodlands replace deserts. This ancient wetness might come down to inadequacies in how we model clouds , which are under no obligation to behave in physical reality as they do in simplified lines of computer code. Hurricanes were almost certainly more consistently punishing 3 million years ago, just as our storms of the future will be. And a more sluggish circulation of the atmosphere might have lulled the trade winds, turning El Ni\u00f1o into \u201cEl Padre.\u201d Perhaps this is what brought rains\u2014and lakes\u2014to the Mojave at this time. Our modern coastlines would have been so far underwater that you\u2019d have to take great pains to avoid getting the bends if you tried scuba diving down to them. Today, traveling east through Virginia, or North or South Carolina, or Georgia, midway through your drive you\u2019ll pass over a gentle 100-foot drop. This is the Orangeburg Scarp, a bluff\u2014hundreds of miles long\u2014that divides the broad, flat coastal plain of the American Southeast. It comprises the eroded and smoothed-out rumors of once-magnificent sea cliffs. Here, waves of the Pliocene high seas chewed away at the middle of the Carolinas\u2014an East Coast Big Sur. This ancient shoreline is visible from space by the change in soil color that divides the states, and is visible on much closer inspection as well: To the east of this strange drop-off, giant megalodon-shark teeth and whale bones litter the Carolina Low Country. Though warped over the ages by the secret workings of the mantle far below, these subtle banks 90 miles inland nevertheless mark the highest shoreline of the Pliocene, when the seas were dozens of feet higher than they are today. But even within this warm Pliocene period, the sea level leaped and fell by as much as 60 feet every 20,000 years, to the rhythm of the Earth\u2019s sway in space. This is because, under this higher-CO 2 regime, the unstable ice sheet in Antarctica took on the volatile temperament that, 1 million years later, would come to characterize North America\u2019s ice sheet, toying with the ancient coastline as if it were a marionette. So this is the Pliocene, the world of the distant present. While today\u2019s projections of future warming tend to end in 2100, the Pliocene illuminates just what sort of long-term changes might inevitably be set in motion by the atmosphere we\u2019ve already engineered. As the great ice sheets melt, the permafrost awakens, and darker forested land encroaches on the world\u2019s tundra, positive feedbacks may eventually launch our planet into a different state altogether, one that might resemble this bygone world. Nevertheless, human civilization is unlikely to keep atmospheric CO 2 at a Pliocene level\u2014so more ancient and extreme analogues must be retrieved. We\u2019re now deeper in the past, and the planet appears truly exotic. The Amazon is running backwards, and gathers in great pools at the foot of the Andes. A seaway stretches from Western Europe to Kazakhstan and spills into the Indian Ocean. California\u2019s Central Valley is open ocean. What today is the northwestern U.S. is especially unrecognizable. Today the airy, columnated canyons of the Columbia River on the Oregon-Washington border swarm with tiny kiteboarders zipping through gorges of basalt. But 16 million years ago, this was a black, unbreathable place, flowing with rivers of incandescent rock. The Columbia River basalts\u2014old lava flows that spread across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, in some places more than two miles thick\u2014were the creation of a class of extremely rare and world-changing volcanic eruptions known as large igneous provinces, or LIPs. Some LIPs in Earth\u2019s history span millions of square miles, erupt for millions of years, inject tens of thousands of gigatons of CO 2 into the air, and are responsible for most of the worst mass extinctions in the history of the planet . They live up to their name\u2014they are large. But these mid-Miocene eruptions were still rather small as far as LIPs go, and so the planet was spared mass death. Nevertheless, the billowing volcanoes raised atmospheric CO 2 up to about 500 ppm, a level that today represents something close to the most ambitious and optimistic scenario possible for limiting our future carbon emissions. In the Miocene, this volcanic CO 2 warmed up the world to at least 4 degrees Celsius and perhaps as much as 8 degrees above modern temperatures. As a result, there were turtles and parrots in Siberia. Canada\u2019s Devon Island, in the high Arctic, is today a desolate wasteland, the largest uninhabited island in the world\u2014and one used by NASA to simulate life on Mars. In the Miocene, its flora resembled Lower Michigan\u2019s. The sweeping grasslands distinctive to our cooler, drier, low-CO 2 world had yet to take over the planet, and so forests were everywhere\u2014in the middle of Australia and Central Asia and Patagonia. All of this vegetation was one of the reasons it was so warm. Forests and shrubs made this planet darker than our own world\u2014one still painted pallid hues in many places by bare land and ice\u2014and allowed it to absorb more heat. This change in the planet\u2019s color is just one of the many long-term feedback loops awaiting us after the ice melts. Long after our initial pulse of CO 2 , they will make our future world warmer and more alien still. As for fauna, we\u2019re now so distantly marooned in time from our own world that most of the creatures that inhabited this leafy planet range from the flatly unfamiliar to the uncannily so. There were big cats that weren\u2019t cats, and rhino-size \u201chell pigs\u201d that weren\u2019t pigs. There were sloths that lived in the ocean and walruses that weren\u2019t related to today\u2019s walruses. Earth\u2019s largest-ever meat-eating land mammals, African juggernauts like Megistotherium and Simbakubwa, not closely related to any living mammals today, tore early elephants apart with bladed mouths. And with CO 2 at 500  ppm, the sea level was about 150 feet higher than today. Approaching Antarctica in the middle Miocene by sea, the waters would be warmer than today, and virtually unvisited by ice. To get to the ice sheet, you\u2019d have to hike far past lakes and forests of conifers that lined the coast. Trudging past the trees and finally over endless tundra, you would come at last to the edge of a much smaller ice sheet whose best days were still ahead of it. An axiom about this land-based Antarctic ice sheet in paleoclimatology is that it\u2019s incredibly stubborn. That is, once you have an ice sheet atop the heart of Antarctica, feedback loops kick in to make it exceedingly hard to get rid of. Barring true climatic madness, a land-based Antarctic ice sheet is essentially there to stay. But in the middle Miocene this young Antarctic ice sheet seemed to have a temper. It might have been \u201csurprisingly dynamic,\u201d as one paper cheerfully puts it. As CO 2 increased from just below today\u2019s levels up to about 500  ppm, Miocene Antarctica shed what today would amount to 30 to 80 percent of the modern ice sheet. In the Miocene, Antarctica seemed exquisitely tuned to small changes in atmospheric CO 2 , in ways that we don\u2019t fully understand and that we\u2019re not incorporating into our models of the future. There will undoubtedly be surprises awaiting us in our high-CO 2 future, just as there were for life that existed in the Miocene. In fact, the Antarctic ice sheet may be more vulnerable today to rapid retreat and disintegration than at any time in its entire 34-million-year history . In the 16 million years since this mid-Miocene heat, the volcanic hot spot responsible for the Columbia River basalts has wandered under Yellowstone. Today it powers a much tamer kind of volcano. It could cover a few states in a few inches of ash and disrupt global agriculture for years, but it couldn\u2019t launch the planet into a new climate for hundreds of thousands of years, or kill most life on the surface. Unfortunately, there is such a supervolcano active on Earth today: industrial civilization. With CO 2 likely to soar past 500  ppm from future emissions, even the sweat-soaked, Siberian-parrot-populated world of the middle Miocene might not tell us everything we need to know about our future climate. It\u2019s time to go back to a global greenhouse climate that ranks among the warmest climate regimes complex life has ever endured. In our final leap backwards, CO 2 at last reaches levels that humans might reproduce in the next 100 years or so. What follows is something like a worst-case scenario for future carbon emissions. But these worst-case projections have continued to prove stubbornly accurate in the 21st century so far , and they remain a possible path for our future. We\u2019re now about to take our largest leap, by far, into the geologic past. We hurdle over 40 million years of history, past volcanic eruptions thousands of times bigger than that of Mount St. Helens, past an asteroid impact that punched out a gigantic crater where the Chesapeake Bay sits today. The Himalayas slump; India unhitches from Asia; and the further back we go, the higher the CO 2 level rises and the warmer the Earth gets. The Antarctic ice sheet, in its death throes, vanishes altogether, and the polar continent instead gives way to monkey puzzle trees and marsupials. We have arrived, finally at the end of our journey, in the greenhouse world of the early age of mammals. Today the last dry land one steps on in Canada before setting out across the ice-choked seas for the North Pole is Ellesmere Island, at the top of the world. But once upon a time there was a rainforest here. We know this because tree stumps still erode out of the barren hillsides, and they\u2019re more than 50 million years old . They\u2019re all that\u2019s left of an ancient polar jungle now whipped by indifferent Arctic winds. But once upon a time, this island was a swampy cathedral of redwoods, whose canopy naves were filled with flying lemurs, giant salamanders, and hippolike beasts that pierced the waters. At this polar latitude, on some late-fall evening of the early Eocene, the sun tried and failed to lift itself from the horizon. A pink twilight reached deep into the jungle, but soon the sun would set entirely here for more than four months. In this unending Arctic dark, the stillness would be broken by the orphaned calls of tiny early primates, who hopped fearlessly over stilled alligators that would start moving again when the sun returned from beyond the horizon. In this unending night, tapirs hunted for mushrooms and munched on leaf litter that was left over from sunny days past and that in the far future would become coal. We have no modern analogue for a swampy rainforest teeming with reptiles that nevertheless endures months of Arctic twilight and polar night. But for each degree Celsius the planet warms, the atmosphere holds about 6 percent more water vapor , and given that global temperatures at the beginning of the age of mammals were roughly 13 degrees warmer than today, it\u2019s difficult to imagine how uncomfortable this planet would be for Ice Age creatures like ourselves. In fact, much of the planet would be rendered off-limits to us, far too hot and humid for human physiology. Not only was this a sweltering age, but it was also one cruelly punctuated by some of the most profound and sudden CO 2 -driven global-warming events in geologic history\u2014on top of this already feverish baseline. Deep under the North Atlantic, the Eocene epoch kicked off in style 56 million years ago with massive sheets of magma that spread sideways through the crust, igniting vast, diffuse deposits of fossil fuels at the bottom of the ocean. This ignition of the underworld injected something like the carbon equivalent of all currently known fossil-fuel reserves into the seas and atmosphere in less than 20,000 years, warming the planet by another 5 to 9 degrees Celsius. Evidence abounds of violent storms and megafloods during this ancient spasm of climate change\u2014episodic waves of torrential rains unlike any on Earth today. In some places, such storms would have been routine, separated by merciless droughts and long, brutal, cloudless heat waves. Seas near the equator may have been almost as hot as a Jacuzzi\u2014too hot for most complex life. As for the rest of the planet, all of this excess CO 2 acidified the oceans, and the world\u2019s coral reefs collapsed. Ocean chemistry took 200,000 years to recover. The most jarring thing about the early age of mammals, though, isn\u2019t merely the extreme heat. It\u2019s the testimony of the plants. In higher-CO 2 conditions, plants reduce the number of pores on their leaves, and fossil leaves from the jungles of the early Eocene have tellingly fewer pores than today\u2019s. By some estimates, CO 2 50 million years ago was about 600 ppm . Other proxies point to higher CO 2 , just over 1,000 ppm, but even that amount has long bedeviled our computer models of climate change. For years, in fact, models have told us that to reproduce this feverish world, we\u2019d need to ramp up CO 2 to more than 4,000 ppm . This ancient planet is far more extreme than anything being predicted for the end of the century by the United Nations or anyone else. After all, the world that hosted the rainforests of Ellesmere Island was 13 degrees Celsius warmer than our own, while the current global ambition, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, is to limit warming to less than 2, or even 1.5, degrees. Part of what explains this glaring disparity is that most climate projections end at the end of the century. Feedbacks that might get you to Eocene- or Miocene-level warmth play out over much longer timescales than a century. But the other, much scarier insight that Earth\u2019s history is very starkly telling us is that we have been missing something crucial in the models we use to predict the future. Some of the models are starting to catch up. In 2019, one of the most computationally demanding climate models ever run, by researchers at the California Institute of Technology, simulated global temperatures suddenly leaping 12 degrees Celsius by the next century if atmospheric CO 2 reached 1,200  ppm\u2014a very bad, but not impossible, emissions pathway. And later that year, scientists from the University of Michigan and the University of Arizona were similarly able to reproduce the warmth of the Eocene by using a more sophisticated model of how water behaves at the smallest scales. The paleoclimatologist Jessica Tierney thinks the key may be the clouds. Today, the San Francisco fog reliably rolls in, stranding bridge towers high above the marine layer like birthday candles. These clouds are a mainstay of west coasts around the world, reflecting sunlight back to space from coastal California and Peru and Namibia. But under higher-CO 2 conditions and higher temperatures, water droplets in incipient clouds could get bigger and rain down faster. In the Eocene, this might have caused these clouds to fall apart and disappear\u2014inviting more solar energy to reach, and warm, the oceans. That might be why the Eocene was so outrageously hot. This sauna of our early mammalian ancestors represents something close to the worst possible scenario for future warming (although some studies claim that humans, under truly nihilistic emissions scenarios, could make the planet even warmer). The good news is the inertia of the Earth\u2019s climate system is such that we still have time to rapidly reverse course, heading off an encore of this world, or that of the Miocene, or even the Pliocene, in the coming decades. All it will require is instantaneously halting the super-eruption of CO 2 disgorged into the atmosphere that began with the Industrial Revolution. We know how to do this, and we cannot underplay the urgency. The fact is that none of these ancient periods is actually an apt analogue for the future if things go wrong. It took millions of years to produce the climates of the Miocene or the Eocene, and the rate of change right now is almost unprecedented in the history of animal life. Humans are currently injecting CO 2 into the air 10 times faster than even during the most extreme periods within the age of mammals. And you don\u2019t need the planet to get as hot as it was in the early Eocene to catastrophically acidify the oceans. Acidification is all about the rate of CO 2 emissions, and we are off the charts. Ocean acidification could reach the same level it did 56 million years ago by later this century, and then keep going. When he coined the term mass extinction in a 1963 paper, \u201cCrises in the History of Life,\u201d the American paleontologist Norman Newell posited that this was what happened when the environment changed faster than evolution could accommodate. Life has speed limits. And in fact, life today is still trying to catch up with the thaw-out of the last ice age, about 12,000 years ago. Meanwhile, our familiar seasons are growing ever more strange: Flycatchers arrive weeks after their caterpillar prey hatches; orchids bloom when there are no bees willing to pollinate them. The early melting of sea ice has driven polar bears ashore, shifting their diet from seals to goose eggs. And that\u2019s after just 1 degree of warming. Subtropical life may have been happy in a warmer Eocene Arctic, but there\u2019s no reason to think such an intimately adapted ecosystem, evolved on a greenhouse planet over millions of years, could be reestablished in a few centuries or millennia. Drown the Florida Everglades, and its crocodilians wouldn\u2019t have an easy time moving north into their old Miocene stomping grounds in New Jersey, much less migrating all the way to the unspoiled Arctic bayous if humans re-create the world of the Eocene. They will run into the levees and fortifications of drowning Florida exurbs. We are imposing a rate of change on the planet that has almost never happened before in geologic history, while largely preventing life on Earth from adjusting to that change. Taking in the whole sweep of Earth\u2019s history, now we see how unnatural, nightmarish, and profound our current experiment on the planet really is. A small population of our particular species of primate has, in only a few decades, unlocked a massive reservoir of old carbon slumbering in the Earth, gathering since the dawn of life, and set off on a global immolation of Earth\u2019s history to power the modern world. As a result, up to half of the tropical coral reefs on Earth have died, 10 trillion tons of ice have melted, the ocean has grown 30 percent more acidic, and global temperatures have spiked. If we keep going down this path for a geologic nanosecond longer, who knows what will happen? The next few fleeting moments are ours, but they will echo for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of years. This is one of the most important times to be alive in the history of life.

{"id":null,"body":"Polls and studies reveal it\u2019s the long, tiring grind that changes opinions about global warming. We\u2019re facing a week with three environmental news pegs: It\u2019s Earth Day, the March for Science is today, and senior advisors at the White House will soon meet to decide whether the United States will remain in the Paris Agreement. Because of all three, you will probably soon hear about a number of new and old polls about climate change and the American public. If you care about climate change, they will be frustrating. These polls often find that most Americans are worried about climate change. (Six out of 10 Americans are \u201cworried,\u201d according to Yale .) Depending on how firms ask the question, they sometimes even find a majority of Americans are concerned. (Pew finds 45 percent are \u201cworried a great deal\u201d; the same Yale poll found only 20 percent were \u201cvery worried.\u201d) When you start proposing hypothetical policies, the numbers often fall. (Fifty percent of Americans support or strongly support a carbon tax , according to a study from the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College.) But when policies aren\u2019t hypothetical\u2014when they\u2019re the status quo\u2014Americans line up behind them. ( Almost 70 percent support former President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan; roughly the same number want the United States to stay in the Paris Agreement.) If you include a partisan watchword in a question, people start answering through a different frame. They give the answer that matches their affiliation\u2014their societal \u201cteam\u201d\u2014even if they may harbor doubts about it. There is a vast partisan disagreement, for instance, on the question of whether scientists near-unanimously agree that human industrial activity is causing global warming. (They do; nearly every study finds unanimity on this issue among scientists. But only 13 percent of self-identified conservative Republicans think that\u2019s the case, as compared to 55 percent of liberal Democrats.) When you leave partisan politics, however, larger majorities appear. Eighty-nine percent and 83 percent of Americans, respectively, support building more solar and wind plants. When you hear these numbers, they can prompt a certain amount of internal wailing. The Earth is dying. The science is clear. It\u2019s so easy and obvious. So why can\u2019t politicians \u200bunderstand that? The wailing is justified, but also exhausting. The entire story of the issue\u2014from the presentation of the polling data, to the it\u2019s-so-obvious messaging deployed around it, to the frustration vented on social media\u2014seems designed to get people to burn out. And keeping up with all the micro-swings in the polling\u2014 concern about climate change is up two percentage points this year! \u2014can seem equally enervating. Yet there\u2019s little reason to constantly follow the micro-trends in polling, especially the ticks up and down in reported concern. Climate change is a \u201cstuck\u201d issue in American politics. The polling continually points to a larger conclusion: Global warming is a highly partisan issue that most voters do not consider particularly significant to them, personally, even if they are worried about it. A Yale poll from last month put it starkly : More than 50 percent of Americans believe that climate change will \u201charm people in the United States,\u201d but fewer than 40 percent of Americans believe it will \u201charm me, personally.\u201d A lot of people know about climate change, and a lot of people think it is generally bad. But they do not change their votes because of it. Americans may change their vote because of economic fear, or defense policy, or to protect their property or social privileges. But they do not vote because the ice caps are melting. This is the heart of the climate issue. There are a few more complicating factors. At this point, if someone is worried about climate change, they\u2019re probably already a consistent Democrat. Journalists have been talking about global warming for 20 years, though not always adeptly. There are just not that many persuadable independents left on the issue. Climate is an exceptionally hard issue for only one party to \u201cown.\u201d Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014a process that experts call decarbonization\u2014is much more daunting than just implementing the Clean Power Plan. If we want to stave off dangerous climate change, the United States may need to adjust its energy policy, its tax policy, its foreign policy, its transportation policy, and its industrial policy in the coming years and decades. Historically, changing all those elements together, in the face of a difficult but necessary policy outcome, has been a bipartisan affair. On top of this, climate even has a small \u201canti-constituency\u201d of voters. These are men, mostly, who hold down jobs in mining or oil extraction. Some of them are located in populous, electorally strategic states. But decarbonizing might prevent them from supporting a more generous welfare state. I want a world where both parties recognize the urgency of addressing climate change\u2014but, in this one, it is not yet clear \u00a0to me that championing decarbonization helps the Democrats more than it hurts them. What will change this dynamic? The stalemate on climate change is a symptom of a sickly and sclerotic political system, but not the disease itself. If Republican political leaders recognized the reality of climate change, bipartisan majorities on climate change would follow. Dave Roberts has written about this idea at Vox, and a meta-analysis of 74 climate polls between 2002 and 2013 reached the same conclusion . We see this partisan effect on other issues. When President Obama threatened to bomb Syria in 2013, over the use of chemical weapons, only 22 percent of Republicans supported the strikes. When President Trump did the same thing last month, 86 percent of Republicans swung to support him. Republican leaders may still be years away from signing onto the issue, though. Joseph Majkut, a climate scientist at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, has talked about the importance of \u201cgrinding\u201d: making good-faith, well-supported arguments and trusting that public opinion will eventually follow. Social science has found that the amount of climate-change discussion in the news increases public concern about the issue. People also seem most receptive to doing something about it when the economy is good. Extreme weather, like heat waves and unusual hurricanes, does not seem to increase general worry about climate change. Instead, it seems to heighten partisan polarization . Perhaps \u201cgrinding\u201d out public opinion is working faster than we think. A majority of young Republicans, ages 18 to 30, believe that human activity is changing the climate . And a majority of them support a carbon tax or some other kind of federal carbon policy.\u00a0\u00a0These young people may never change their votes on account of climate change, but they may force their party leaders to agree with them. At the same time, climate change as an issue of widespread but low-salience concern means that people tend to be fine with the status quo, when it changes. If the next administration implements a national climate policy, and it does not massively disrupt the economy, then the fat majorities that now support the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan may follow it. I am not exactly optimistic about the issue, but there is no point wallowing in every new and frustrating poll. They tell the same story. We know the shape of climate change as a national-political issue today. It is frustrating, it can inspire feelings of futility. Indeed, no matter what we do, some global warming is coming for us. But we can still stave off the worst of it.","headline":"What Americans Really Think About Climate Change","article_name":523881.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/04\/climate-polling-burnout\/523881\/","date_published":"2017-04-22 08:30:00","article_length":7660,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:00.657176","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/04\/climate-polling-burnout\/523881\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"New Mexico\u2019s Hatch Valley faces its biggest test yet. In the village of Hatch, New Mexico, at a chile shop cloaked in red ristras\u2014the ornamental strings of chiles that adorn many doorways and windows in the state\u2014Jessie Moreno, the young farmer who owns the store, tallies up sales, offers free samples, and cranks an iron basket-topped chile roaster. \u201cThis little festival is like a gold mine for us,\u201d said Moreno, 21, gesturing toward three hissing chile roasters. A smoky, pungent aroma rose from the tumbling specimens of Capsicum annuum and permeated the air. The town\u2019s annual Hatch Chile Festival bolstered sales for two days, attracting about 15,000 chile connoisseurs and hobbyists from as far away as West Virginia, Louisiana, and Florida, in a welcome boost after last year\u2019s pandemic-caused hiatus. Even so, Moreno and other local farmers couldn\u2019t help worrying about the crop\u2019s uncertain future and its profitability. The continued drought and an unprecedented workforce shortage worsened by the coronavirus pandemic have rattled the agribusiness that is central to the state\u2019s identity, says Stephanie Walker, a chile specialist at the Chile Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, one of a handful of research centers in the world dedicated to the plant. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a breaking point now.\u201d Chile peppers, which are originally native to South America, were introduced to the harsh, iron-rich red earth of what\u2019s now New Mexico by Spanish colonizers over four centuries ago. But it wasn\u2019t until 1921 that Fabi\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, a Mexican American horticulturist, developed the long green chile pepper after years of researching and cross-breeding plants from Hispanic-family gardens. It quickly became a customer favorite: Green chile is now smothered on burritos and used as a seasoning for popular snacks such as popcorn and crackers\u2014it\u2019s even mixed with lemonade. When the leafy, pod-bearing plant ripens at the end of summer, it becomes a red chile pepper, which has a sweeter and mellower taste and is also used in a variety of New Mexican dishes. Though long green chiles are also commercially grown in Mexico, Arizona, California, and Colorado, locals and chile enthusiasts believe that the combination of the high-desert climate, sandy loam soil, and water from the Rio Grande gives the chiles grown in the Hatch Valley a distinctive flat and earthy flavor. New Mexico, which proudly calls itself \u201cthe chile capital of the world,\u201d boasts an official state question: \u201cRed or green?\u201d But now, the state is asking a different question: Can its signature crop weather the changing climate? New Mexico\u2019s hottest commodity is delicate. It doesn\u2019t thrive below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and can be killed by even a light frost, but it can also be harmed by high temperatures; it doesn\u2019t fruit above 95 degrees. (Botanically speaking, chiles, like tomatoes, are fruits, not vegetables, because they have internal and edible seeds.) This doesn\u2019t bode well in a climate that\u2019s growing hotter and more unpredictable every year. In just two decades, the Southwest is projected to heat up by more than the global average of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. It will also be increasingly battered by extreme weather events such as spring freezes and heat waves, according to an August report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This year, spring heat waves accelerated snowmelt evaporation in the Rio Grande, leaving both the river and Elephant Butte Reservoir, which it feeds, with a dwindling supply of water for agriculture in the southern part of the state. With the reservoir hovering at about 5 percent of capacity over spring and summer, the Elephant Butte Irrigation District provided surface water to farmers in southern New Mexico for just 27 days this growing season. It was one of the worst curtailments in the irrigation district in over a century, according to J. Phillip King, a water-resource consultant for the district. \u201cThis is an unfortunate, disturbing pattern that is setting in\u2014a multi-decadal drought now superimposed on an increasingly arid climate.\u201d Back at his farm, Moreno stood looking out at the 9.5-acre field he leases. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that all our water is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad used to tell me that before these two decades, he could get water from the river from February \u2019til fall.\u201d But that\u2019s no longer true: To supply his plants this summer, Moreno had to pump groundwater from his 30-foot-deep well. It cost him thousands of dollars to irrigate his chile fields using the pump. And even that last resort might not last for long. Increased pumping is lowering the water table, and the saline concentration in some wells has tripled or quadrupled, damaging the plant\u2019s roots and causing wilt and other diseases. The legality of pumping groundwater is also up in the air. A U.S. Supreme Court lawsuit between New Mexico and Texas over groundwater pumping along the Rio Grande could further cut the amount of groundwater available for chile farmers and reduce the crop\u2019s acreage, according to King, a witness testifying in the case. The case has lasted eight years now, and a ruling is still pending. The uncertainty about climate, water, and water rights is a constant worry for Moreno. The son of two migrant workers who labored in chile fields and processing plants, he is proud to run his own family-owned chile business, which he hopes to eventually pass on to his 1-year-old son. But he wonders if there will be any water available for chiles by then. \u201cI really hate to see the chile in this valley go down,\u201d Moreno said forlornly. Beyond the climate woes, chile farmers are also facing a labor shortage. \u201cNobody wants to work,\u201d Rigo Gutierrez says. He and his wife, Maribel, a farmer and chile laborer, run a seasonal shack two miles from Moreno\u2019s shop. In past harvesting seasons, the couple hired four family friends to pick and roast. This year, they\u2019ve had to do everything themselves. Laborers harvest the fruit almost entirely by hand before the chiles turn red in late October. Starting in July, pickers head into the rows of crops with plastic buckets, grabbing the pods with the right \u201csqueeze\u201d and dashing back to waiting pickup trucks as soon as their buckets are full. The state needs about 3,000 seasonal workers for the $50 million industry, but this year it\u2019s been short about 1,350, says Joram Robbs, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association. \u201cThis year is even worse than last year, when everything was shut down,\u201d Robbs says. He blamed federal pandemic unemployment benefits, which expired at the start of September. As an incentive, in mid-August, industry leaders negotiated with New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to use $5 million of the federal pandemic-relief fund to boost wages among chile pickers and process-plant workers up to $19.50 per hour, almost twice the state\u2019s minimum wage of $10.50 per hour. By early October, according to Robbs, the incentive had eased the hiring shortage for farms and processing plants, though the problem was far from resolved. Some smaller farmers, scientists, and labor-rights activists are ambivalent about the one-time cash infusion, saying the worker shortage is less about the unemployment benefits than it is about historical labor and immigration injustices. According to the Border Agricultural Workers Project, a nonprofit that has organized farmworkers in the borderlands for over 30 years, the average annual chile-picking wage of immigrant laborers has risen by only about $1,000, from $6,000 to $7,000. However, the cost of living in the U.S. has almost doubled from what it was in 1993, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During the pandemic, the job\u2019s backbreaking nature was compounded by the lack of personal protective equipment, sanitation, and hand-washing facilities. It\u2019s \u201cnot that there\u2019s no workers available for the chile harvest,\u201d Carlos Marentes, the director of the Border Agricultural Workers Project, says. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue with their safety, wages and working conditions.\u201d In recent decades, chile fields have given way to less labor-intensive, more profitable crops like pecans and alfalfa, which, ironically, consume a lot more water than chile. As a result, the chile-harvesting acreage in New Mexico has shrunk from an all-time high of 34,000 acres in 1992 to around 8,000. Still, here in the Hatch Valley, farmers like Moreno uphold the tradition of growing a beloved plant. As chiles tossed in the roasters behind him, Moreno told me that the money he makes at the chile festival will bring him one step closer to his dream of owning a 30-acre farm. \u201cMy parents came from nothing and built it up,\u201d he said, referring to the shop he runs and the acres he currently leases. \u201cAnd I am not about to lose it just yet.\u201d This post appears courtesy of High Country News .","headline":"The Chile Capital of the World Is Running Out of Water","article_name":620551.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/10\/climate-change-coming-new-mexicos-chile-peppers\/620551\/","date_published":"2021-10-30 12:00:00","article_length":8850,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:00.992104","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/10\/climate-change-coming-new-mexicos-chile-peppers\/620551\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate change in the next century (and beyond) could be enormously disruptive, spreading disease and sparking wars. It could also be a windfall for some people, businesses, and nations. A guide to how we all might get along in a warming world Coastal cities inundated, farming regions parched, ocean currents disrupted, tropical diseases spreading, glaciers melting\u2014an artificial greenhouse effect could generate countless tribulations. If Earth\u2019s climate changes meaningfully\u2014and the National Academy of Sciences, previously skeptical, said in 2005 that signs of climate change have become significant\u2014there could be broad-based disruption of the global economy unparalleled by any event other than World War II. Economic change means winners as well as losers. Huge sums will be made and lost if the global climate changes. Everyone wonders what warming might do to the environment\u2014but what might it do to the global distribution of money and power? Whether mainly natural or mainly artificial, climate change could bring different regions of the world tremendous benefits as well as drastic problems. The world had been mostly warming for thousands of years before the industrial era began, and that warming has been indisputably favorable to the spread of civilization. The trouble is that the world\u2019s economic geography is today organized according to a climate that has largely prevailed since the Middle Ages\u2014runaway climate change would force big changes in the physical ordering of society. In the past, small climate changes have had substantial impact on agriculture, trade routes, and the types of products and commodities that sell. Larger climate shifts have catalyzed the rise and fall of whole societies. The Mayan Empire, for instance, did not disappear \u201cmysteriously\u201d; it likely fell into decline owing to decades of drought that ruined its agricultural base and deprived its cities of drinking water. On the other side of the coin, Europe\u2019s Medieval Warm Period, which lasted from around 1000 to 1400, was essential to the rise of Spain, France, and England: Those clement centuries allowed the expansion of farm production, population, cities, and universities, which in turn set the stage for the Industrial Revolution. Unless greenhouse-effect theory is completely wrong\u2014and science increasingly supports the idea that it is right\u201421st-century climate change means that sweeping social and economic changes are in the works. To date the greenhouse-effect debate has been largely carried out in abstractions\u2014arguments about the distant past (what do those 100,000-year-old ice cores in Greenland really tell us about ancient temperatures, anyway?) coupled to computer-model conjecture regarding the 22nd century, with the occasional Hollywood disaster movie thrown in. Soon, both abstraction and postapocalyptic fantasy could be pushed aside by the economic and political realities of a warming world. If the global climate continues changing, many people and nations will find themselves in possession of land and resources of rising value, while others will suffer dire losses\u2014and these winners and losers could start appearing faster than you might imagine. Add artificially triggered climate change to the volatility already initiated by globalization, and the next few decades may see previously unthinkable levels of economic upheaval, in which fortunes are won and lost based as much on the physical climate as on the business climate. It may sound odd to ask of global warming, What\u2019s in it for me? But the question is neither crass nor tongue-in-cheek. The ways in which climate change could skew the world\u2019s distribution of wealth should help us appreciate just how profoundly an artificial greenhouse effect might shake our lives. Moreover, some of the lasting effects of climate change are likely to come not so much from the warming itself but from how we react to it: If the world warms appreciably, men and women will not sit by idly, eating bonbons and reading weather reports; there will be instead what economists call \u201cadaptive response,\u201d most likely a great deal of it. Some aspects of this response may inflame tensions between those who are winning and those who are losing. How people, the global economy, and the international power structure adapt to climate change may influence how we live for generations. If the world warms, who will win? Who will lose? And what\u2019s in it for you? Real estate might be expected to appreciate steadily in value during the 21st century, given that both the global population and global prosperity are rising. The supply of land is fixed, and if there\u2019s a fixed supply of something but a growing demand, appreciation should be automatic. That\u2019s unless climate change increases the supply of land by warming currently frosty areas while throwing the amount of desirable land into tremendous flux. My hometown of Buffalo, New York, for example, is today so d\u00e9class\u00e9 that some of its stately Beaux-Arts homes, built during the Gilded Age and overlooking a park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, sell for about the price of one-bedroom condos in Boston or San Francisco. If a warming world makes the area less cold and snowy, Buffalo might become one of the country\u2019s desirable addresses. At the same time, Arizona and Nevada, blazing growth markets today, might become unbearably hot and see their real-estate markets crash. If the oceans rise, Florida\u2019s rapid growth could be, well, swamped by an increase in its perilously high groundwater table. Houston could decline, made insufferable by worsened summertime humidity, while the splendid, rustic Laurentide Mountains region north of Montreal, if warmed up a bit, might transmogrify into the new Poconos. These are just a few of many possible examples. Climate change could upset the applecarts of real-estate values all over the world, with low-latitude properties tanking while high latitudes become the Sun Belt of the mid-21st century. Local changes in housing demand are only small beer. To consider the big picture, examine a Mercator projection of our planet, and observe how the Earth\u2019s landmasses spread from the equator to the poles. Assume global warming is reasonably uniform. (Some computer models suggest that warming will vary widely by region; for the purposes of this article, suffice it to say that all predictions regarding an artificial greenhouse effect are extremely uncertain.) The equatorial and low-latitude areas of the world presumably will become hotter and less desirable as places of habitation, plus less valuable in economic terms; with a few exceptions, these areas are home to developing nations where living standards are already low. So where is the high-latitude landmass that might grow more valuable in a warming world? By accident of geography, except for Antarctica nearly all such land is in the Northern Hemisphere, whose continents are broad west-to-east. Only a relatively small portion of South America, which narrows as one travels south, is high latitude, and none of Africa or Australia is. (Cape Town is roughly the same distance from the equator as Cape Hatteras; Melbourne is about the same distance from the equator as Manhattan.) More specifically, nearly all the added land-value benefits of a warming world might accrue to Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, and Scandinavia. This raises the possibility that an artificial greenhouse effect could harm nations that are already hard pressed and benefit nations that are already affluent. If Alaska turned temperate, it would drive conservationists to distraction, but it would also open for development an area more than twice the size of Texas. Rising world temperatures might throw Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and other low-latitude nations into generations of misery, while causing Canada, Greenland, and Scandinavia to experience a rip-roarin\u2019 economic boom. Many Greenlanders are already cheering the retreat of glaciers, since this melting stands to make their vast island far more valuable. Last July, The Wall Street Journal reported that the growing season in the portion of Greenland open to cultivation is already two weeks longer than it was in the 1970s. And Russia! For generations poets have bemoaned this realm as cursed by enormous, foreboding, harsh Siberia. What if the region in question were instead enormous, temperate, inviting Siberia? Climate change could place Russia in possession of the largest new region of pristine, exploitable land since the sailing ships of Europe first spied the shores of what would be called North America. The snows of Siberia cover soils that have never been depleted by controlled agriculture. What\u2019s more, beneath Siberia\u2019s snow may lie geologic formations that hold vast deposits of fossil fuels, as well as mineral resources. When considering ratification of the Kyoto Protocol to regulate greenhouse gases, the Moscow government dragged its feet, though the treaty was worded to offer the Russians extensive favors. Why might this have happened? Perhaps because Russia might be much better off in a warming world: Warming\u2019s benefits to Russia could exceed those to all other nations combined. Of course, it could be argued that politicians seldom give much thought\u2014one way or the other\u2014to actions whose value will become clear only after they leave office, so perhaps Moscow does not have a grand strategy to warm the world for its own good. But a warmer world may be much to Russia\u2019s liking, whether it comes by strategy or accident. And how long until high-latitude nations realize global warming might be in their interests? In recent years, Canada has increased its greenhouse-gas output more rapidly than most other rich countries. Maybe this is a result of prosperity and oil-field development\u2014or maybe those wily Canadians have a master plan for their huge expanse of currently uninhabitable land. Global warming might do more for the North, however, than just opening up new land. Temperatures are rising on average, but when are they rising? Daytime? Nighttime? Winter? Summer? One fear about artificially triggered climate change has been that global warming would lead to scorching summer-afternoon highs, which would kill crops and brown out the electric power grid. Instead, so far a good share of the warming\u2014especially in North America\u2014has come in the form of nighttime and winter lows that are less low. Higher lows reduce the harshness of winter in northern climes and moderate the demand for energy. And fewer freezes allow extended growing seasons, boosting farm production. In North America, spring comes ever earlier\u2014in recent years, trees have flowered in Washington, D.C., almost a week earlier on average than a generation ago. People may find this creepy, but earlier springs and milder winters can have economic value to agriculture\u2014and lest we forget, all modern societies, including the United States, are grounded in agriculture. If a primary impact of an artificially warmed world is to make land in Canada, Greenland, Russia, Scandinavia, and the United States more valuable, this could have three powerful effects on the 21st-century global situation. First, historically privileged northern societies might not decline geopolitically, as many commentators have predicted. Indeed, the great age of northern power may lie ahead, if Earth\u2019s very climate is on the verge of conferring boons to that part of the world. Should it turn out that headlong fossil-fuel combustion by northern nations has set in motion climate change that strengthens the relative world position of those same nations, future essayists will have a field day. But the prospect is serious. By the middle of the 21st century, a new global balance of power may emerge in which Russia and America are once again the world\u2019s paired superpowers\u2014only this time during a Warming War instead of a Cold War. Second, if northern societies find that climate change makes them more wealthy, the quest for world equity could be dealt a huge setback. Despite the popular misconception, globalized economics have been a positive force for increased equity. As the Indian economist Surjit Bhalla has shown, the developing world produced 29 percent of the globe\u2019s income in 1950; by 2000 that share had risen to 42 percent, while the developing world\u2019s share of population rose at a slower rate. All other things being equal, we might expect continued economic globalization to distribute wealth more widely. But if climate change increases the value of northern land and resources, while leaving nations near the equator hotter and wracked by storms or droughts, all other things would not be equal. That brings us to the third great concern: If climate change causes developing nations to falter, and social conditions within them deteriorate, many millions of jobless or hungry refugees may come to the borders of the favored North, demanding to be let in. If the very Earth itself turns against poor nations, punishing them with heat and storms, how could the United States morally deny the refugees succor? Shifts in the relative values of places and resources have often led to war, and it is all too imaginable that climate change will cause nations to envy each other\u2019s territory. This envy is likely to run both north-south and up-down. North-south? Suppose climate change made Brazil less habitable, while bringing an agreeable mild clime to the vast and fertile Argentinean pampas to Brazil\u2019s south. S\u00e3o Paulo is already one of the world\u2019s largest cities. Would a desperate, overheated Brazil of the year 2037\u2014its population exploding\u2014hesitate to attack Argentina for cool, inviting land? Now consider the up-down prospect: the desire to leave low-lying areas for altitude. Here\u2019s an example: Since its independence, in 1947, Pakistan has kept a hand in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Today Americans view this issue through the lens of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, but from Islamabad\u2019s perspective, the goal has always been to keep Afghanistan available as a place for retreat, should Pakistan lose a war with India. What if the climate warms, rendering much of Pakistan unbearable to its citizens? (Temperatures of 100-plus degrees are already common in the Punjab.) Afghanistan\u2019s high plateaus, dry and rocky as they are, might start looking pleasingly temperate as Pakistan warms, and the Afghans might see yet another army headed their way. A warming climate could cause other landgrabs on a national scale. Today Greenland is a largely self-governing territory of Denmark that the world leaves in peace because no nation covets its shivering expanse. Should the Earth warm, Copenhagen might assert greater jurisdiction over Greenland, or stronger governments might scheme to seize this dwarf continent, which is roughly three times the size of Texas. Today Antarctica is under international administration, and this arrangement is generally accepted because the continent has no value beyond scientific research. If the world warmed for a long time\u2014and it would likely take centuries for the Antarctic ice sheet to melt completely\u2014international jockeying to seize or conquer Antarctica might become intense. Some geologists believe large oil deposits are under the Antarctic crust: In earlier epochs, the austral pole was densely vegetated and had conditions suitable for the formation of fossil fuels. And though I\u2019ve said to this point that Canada would stand to become more valuable in a warming world, actually, Canada and Nunavut would. For centuries, Europeans drove the indigenous peoples of what is now Canada farther and farther north. In 1993, Canada agreed to grant a degree of independence to the primarily Inuit population of Nunavut, and this large, cold region in the country\u2019s northeast has been mainly self-governing since 1999. The Inuit believe they are ensconced in the one place in this hemisphere that the descendants of Europe will never, ever want. This could turn out to be wrong. For investors, finding attractive land to buy and hold for a warming world is fraught with difficulties, particularly when looking abroad. If considering plots on the pampas, for example, should one negotiate with the current Argentinian owners or the future Brazilian ones? Perhaps a safer route would be the contrarian one, focused on the likelihood of falling land values in places people may leave. If strict carbon-dioxide regulations are enacted, corporations will shop for \u201coffsets,\u201d including projects that absorb carbon dioxide from the sky. Growing trees is a potential greenhouse-gas offset, and can be done comparatively cheaply in parts of the developing world, even on land that people may stop wanting. If you jump into the greenhouse-offset business, what you might plant is leucaena, a rapidly growing tree species suited to the tropics that metabolizes carbon dioxide faster than most trees. But you\u2019ll want to own the land in order to control the sale of the credits. Consider a possible sequence of events: First, climate change makes parts of the developing world even less habitable than they are today; then, refugees flee these areas; finally, land can be snapped up at Filene\u2019s Basement prices\u2014and used to grow leucaena trees. If Al Gore\u2019s movie, An Inconvenient Truth , is to be believed, you should start selling coastal real estate now. Gore\u2019s film maintains that an artificial greenhouse effect could raise sea levels 20 feet in the near future, flooding Manhattan, San Francisco, and dozens of other cities; Micronesia would simply disappear below the waves. Gore\u2019s is the doomsday number, but the scientific consensus is worrisome enough: In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences warned that oceans may rise between four inches and three feet by the year 2100. Four inches may not sound like a lot, but it would imperil parts of coastal Florida and the Carolinas, among other places. A three-foot sea-level rise would flood significant portions of Bangladesh, threaten the national survival of the Netherlands, and damage many coastal cities, while submerging pretty much all of the world\u2019s trendy beach destinations to boot. And the Asian Tigers? Shanghai and Hong Kong sit right on the water. Raise the deep a few feet, and these Tiger cities would be abandoned. The global temperature increase of the last century\u2014about one degree Fahrenheit\u2014was modest and did not cause any dangerous sea-level rise. Sea-level worries turn on the possibility that there is some nonlinear aspect of the climate system, a \u201ctipping point\u201d that could cause the rate of global warming to accelerate markedly. One reason global warming has not happened as fast as expected appears to be that the oceans have absorbed much of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity. Studies suggest, however, that the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide may be slowing; as the absorption rate declines, atmospheric buildup will happen faster, and climate change could speed up. At the first sign of an increase in the rate of global warming: Sell, sell, sell your coastal properties. Unload those London and Seattle waterfront holdings. Buy land and real property in Omaha or Ontario. An artificial greenhouse effect may also alter ocean currents in unpredictable ways. Already there is some evidence that the arctic currents are changing, while the major North Atlantic current that moves warm water north from the equator may be losing energy. If the North Atlantic current falters, temperatures could fall in Europe even as the world overall warms. Most of Europe lies to the north of Maine yet is temperate because the North Atlantic current carries huge volumes of warm water to the seas off Scotland; that warm water is Europe\u2019s weathermaker. Geological studies show that the North Atlantic current has stopped in the past. If this current stops again because of artificial climate change, Europe might take on the climate of present-day Newfoundland. As a result, it might depopulate, while the economic value of everything within its icy expanse declines. The European Union makes approximately the same contribution to the global economy as the United States makes: Significantly falling temperatures in Europe could trigger a worldwide recession. While staying ready to sell your holdings in Europe, look for purchase opportunities near the waters of the Arctic Circle. In 2005, a Russian research ship became the first surface vessel ever to reach the North Pole without the aid of an icebreaker. If arctic sea ice melts, shipping traffic will begin transiting the North Pole. Andrew Revkin\u2019s 2006 book, The North Pole Was Here , profiles Pat Broe, who in 1997 bought the isolated far-north port of Churchill, Manitoba, from the Canadian government for $7. Assuming arctic ice continues to melt, the world\u2019s cargo vessels may begin sailing due north to shave thousands of miles off their trips, and the port of Churchill may be bustling. If arctic polar ice disappears and container vessels course the North Pole seas, shipping costs may decline\u2014to the benefit of consumers. Asian manufacturers, especially, should see their costs of shipping to the United States and the European Union fall. At the same time, heavily trafficked southern shipping routes linking East Asia to Europe and to America\u2019s East Coast could see less traffic, and port cities along that route\u2014such as Singapore\u2014might decline. Concurrently, good relations with Nunavut could become of interest to the world\u2019s corporations. Oh, and there may be oil under the arctic waters. Who would own that oil? The United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark already assert legally complex claims to parts of the North Pole seas\u2014including portions that other nations consider open waters not subject to sovereign control. Today it seems absurd to imagine the governments of the world fighting over the North Pole seas, but in the past many causes of battle have seemed absurd before the artillery fire began. Canada is already conducting naval exercises in the arctic waters, and making no secret of this. Then again, perhaps ownership of these waters will go in an entirely different direction. The 21st century is likely to see a movement to create private-property rights in the ocean (ocean property rights are the most promising solution to overfishing of the open seas). Private-property rights in the North Pole seas, should they come into existence, might generate a rush to rival the Sooners\u2019 settlement of Oklahoma in the late 1800s. Whatever happens to our oceans, climate change might also cause economic turmoil by affecting freshwater supplies. Today nearly all primary commodities, including petroleum, appear in ample supply. Freshwater is an exception: China is depleting aquifers at an alarming rate in order to produce enough rice to feed itself, while freshwater is scarce in much of the Middle East and parts of Africa. Freshwater depletion is especially worrisome in Egypt, Libya, and several Persian Gulf states. Greenhouse-effect science is so uncertain that researchers have little idea whether a warming world would experience more or less precipitation. If it turns out that rain and snow decline as the world warms, dwindling supplies of drinking water and freshwater for agriculture may be the next resource emergency. For investors this would suggest a cautious view of the booms in China and Dubai, as both places may soon face freshwater-supply problems. (Cost-effective desalinization continues to elude engineers.) On the other hand, where water rights are available in these areas, grab them. Much of the effect that global warming will have on our water is speculative, so water-related climate change will be a high-risk\/high-reward matter for investors and societies alike. The biggest fear is that artificially triggered climate change will shift rainfall away from today\u2019s productive breadbasket areas and toward what are now deserts or, worse, toward the oceans. (From the human perspective, all ocean rain represents wasted freshwater.) The reason Malthusian catastrophes have not occurred as humanity has grown is that for most of the last half century, farm yields have increased faster than population. But the global agricultural system is perilously poised on the assumption that growing conditions will continue to be good in the breadbasket areas of the United States, India, China, and South America. If rainfall shifts away from those areas, there could be significant human suffering for many, many years, even if, say, Siberian agriculture eventually replaces lost production elsewhere. By reducing farm yield, rainfall changes could also cause skyrocketing prices for commodity crops, something the global economy has rarely observed in the last 30 years. Recent studies show that in the last few decades, precipitation in North America is increasingly the result of a few downpours rather than lots of showers. Downpours cause flooding and property damage, while being of less use to agriculture than frequent soft rains. Because the relationship between artificially triggered climate change and rainfall is conjectural, investors presently have no way to avoid buying land in places that someday might be hit with frequent downpours. But this concern surely raises a red flag about investments in India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, where monsoon rains are already a leading social problem. Water-related investments might be attractive in another way: for hydropower. Zero-emission hydropower might become a premium energy form if greenhouse gases are strictly regulated. Quebec is the Saudi Arabia of roaring water. Already the hydropower complex around James Bay is one of the world\u2019s leading sources of water- generated electricity. For 30 years, environmentalists and some Cree activists opposed plans to construct a grand hydropower complex that essentially would dam all large rivers flowing into the James and Hudson bays. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine Canada completing the reengineering of northern Quebec for hydropower, if demand from New England and the Midwest becomes strong enough. Similarly, there is hydropower potential in the Chilean portions of Patagonia. This is a wild and beautiful region little touched by human activity\u2014and an intriguing place to snap up land for hydropower reservoirs. Last October, the treasury office of the United Kingdom estimated that unless we adapt, global warming could eventually subtract as much as 20 percent of the gross domestic product from the world economy. Needless to say, if that happens, not even the cleverest portfolio will help you. This estimate is worst-case, however, and has many economists skeptical. Optimists think dangerous global warming might be averted at surprisingly low cost (see \u201cSome Convenient Truths,\u201d September 2006). Once regulations create a profit incentive for the invention of greenhouse-gas-reducing technology, an outpouring of innovation is likely. Some of those who formulate greenhouse- gas-control ideas will become rich; everyone will benefit from the environmental safeguards the ideas confer. Enactment of some form of binding greenhouse-gas rules is now essential both to slow the rate of greenhouse-gas accumulation and to create an incentive for inventors, engineers, and businesspeople to devise the ideas that will push society beyond the fossil-fuel age. The New York Times recently groused that George W. Bush\u2019s fiscal 2007 budget includes only $4.2 billion for federal research that might cut greenhouse-gas emissions. This is the wrong concern: Progress would be faster if the federal government spent nothing at all on greenhouse-gas-reduction research\u2014but enacted regulations that gave the private sector a significant profit motive to find solutions that work in actual use, as opposed to on paper in government studies. The market has caused the greenhouse-gas problem, and the market is the best hope of solving it. Offering market incentives for the development of greenhouse-gas controls\u2014indeed, encouraging profit making in greenhouse-gas controls\u2014is the most promising path to avoiding the harm that could befall the dispossessed of developing nations as the global climate changes. Yet if global-warming theory is right, higher global temperatures are already inevitable. Even the most optimistic scenario for reform envisions decades of additional greenhouse-gas accumulation in the atmosphere, and that in turn means a warming world. The warming may be manageable, but it is probably unstoppable in the short term. This suggests that a major investment sector of the near future will be climate-change adaptation. Crops that grow in high temperatures, homes and buildings designed to stay cool during heat waves, vehicles that run on far less fuel, waterfront structures that can resist stronger storms\u2014the list of needed adaptations will be long, and all involve producing, buying, and selling. Environmentalists don\u2019t like talk of adaptation, as it implies making our peace with a warmer world. That peace, though, must be made\u2014and the sooner businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs get to work, the better. Why, ultimately, should nations act to control greenhouse gases, rather than just letting climate turmoil happen and seeing who profits? One reason is that the cost of controls is likely to be much lower than the cost of rebuilding the world. Coastal cities could be abandoned and rebuilt inland, for instance, but improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in order to stave off rising sea levels should be far more cost-effective. Reforms that prevent major economic and social disruption from climate change are likely to be less expensive, across the board, than reacting to the change. The history of antipollution programs shows that it is always cheaper to prevent emissions than to reverse any damage they cause. For the United States, there\u2019s another argument that is particularly keen. The present ordering of the world favors the United States in nearly every respect\u2014political, economic, even natural, considering America\u2019s excellent balance of land and resources. Maybe a warming world would favor the United States more; this is certainly possible. But when the global order already places America at No. 1, why would we want to run the risk of climate change that alters that order? Keeping the world economic system and the global balance of power the way they are seems very strongly in the U.S. national interest\u2014and keeping things the way they are requires prevention of significant climate change. That, in the end, is what\u2019s in it for us.","headline":"Global Warming: Who Loses\u2014and Who Wins?","article_name":305698.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2007\/04\/global-warming-who-loses-and-who-wins\/305698\/","date_published":"2007-04-01 16:00:00","article_length":30665,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:01.335411","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2007\/04\/global-warming-who-loses-and-who-wins\/305698\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new paper questions the growing body of evidence that weather fluctuations can prompt wars, but researchers have doubts about its value. Updated on February 13, 2018 It\u2019s one of the most important questions of the 21st century: Will climate change provide the extra spark that pushes two otherwise peaceful nations into war? In the past half-decade, a growing body of research\u2014spanning economics, political science, and ancient and modern history\u2014has argued that it can and will. Historians have found temperature or rainfall change implicated in the fall of Rome and the many wars of the 17th century . A team of economists at UC Berkeley and Stanford University have gone further,  arguing that an empirical connection between violence and climate change persists across 12,000 years of human history. Meanwhile, high-profile scientists and powerful politicians have endorsed the idea that global warming helped push Syria into civil war. \u201cClimate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world,\u201d Barack Obama said in 2015 , but \u201cdrought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria.\u201d The next year, Bernie Sanders declared that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d If you live on a planet expecting changes to temperature or rainfall in the coming decades\u2014which will come faster and stronger than the many natural climate changes of the past\u2014it\u2019s all a bit worrying. So a paper published Monday in Nature Climate Change  might seem like a nice respite. After undertaking a large-scale analysis of more than 100 papers published on the topic, the article argues that the connections between climate change and war aren\u2019t as strong as they seem\u2014that the entire literature \u201coverstates the links between both phenomena.\u201d Phew , you might think, maybe things aren\u2019t so bad . Except that\u2014to hear scientists who study the issue tell it\u2014the paper does not make its own case as strongly as it may seem at first. \u201cI can\u2019t see what the authors are trying to accomplish with this article,\u201d says Elizabeth Chalecki , a political scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The paper arrives into a field deeply polarized between researchers who endorse a link between climate change and violence and those who reject one. For scholars who approve of the link, the paper doesn\u2019t prove its point or even say much of anything new. And while researchers who rebuff the link are more charitable to the paper, they also do not think it throws the field\u2019s most famous studies into question\u2014because they already questioned the veracity of that work. \u201cSome may read this paper as saying that there\u2019s lots of literature that says climate change causes conflict, and that this literature is based on sampling errors,\u201d says Jan Selby , a professor of international relations at the University of Sussex. \u201cBut even before this paper, there was huge disagreement about what links could be made between climate change and conflict. And irrespective of the question of sampling error, I think the evidence in many of those papers is really weak.\u201d First, though, to the paper itself. The authors attempt a large-scale analysis of the entire field of conflict and climate-change research. To do this, they searched an enormous academic database for certain keywords\u2014like climate , war , weather , and unrest \u2014then pruned the thousands of articles that they found down to a slim 124 that substantively addressed the connection between the two topics. Then, they analyzed the resulting body of papers for the names of certain countries and regions. After running this analysis, the authors conclude that the entire field is biased in two ways: toward countries that are easy for English-speaking researchers to access, like Kenya and Nigeria; and toward countries where conflict has already erupted, like Syria and Sudan. They also say that the literature focuses too much on Africa, ignoring vulnerable countries in Asia and South America. The countries that were mentioned most in the climate-conflict literature included Kenya, Sudan, Egypt, India, Iraq, and Israel and the Palestinian territories. (Though even the two most-mentioned countries, Kenya and Sudan, only appeared in 8.8 percent of all papers.) That list shares very little overlap with a list of countries that should theoretically be the most vulnerable to climate change, which includes Rwanda, Honduras, Haiti, Myanmar, and the tiny Pacific island nation of Kiribati. But it is quite similar to a list of the countries that have suffered the most combat-related deaths in the last quarter-century. \u201cIf we only look at places where violence is, can we learn anything about peaceful adaptation to climate change? And if we only look at those places where there is violence, do we tend to see a link because we are only focusing on the places where there is violence in the first place?\u201d asked Tobias Ide , a coauthor of the paper and a peace and conflict researcher at the Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research. He believes the study throws both the quantitative and qualitative research on the question into doubt. The qualitative research suffers from \u201cthe streetlight effect,\u201d an overreliance on English-speaking former colonies in Africa where it is easier to do research, he says. (The \u201cstreetlight effect\u201d refers to only looking for your keys\u2014or anything else\u2014where it\u2019s easiest to see in the dark.) Quantitative research, he says, is ailed by \u201csampling on the dependent variable\u201d: that is, only studying war in places where there is already war. Ide and many other researchers worry that such research will eventually harm the people that live in the places that are being studied. \u201cIn Sudan, Kenya, Syria, people say climate change is causing conflict, and that it will cause more conflict in the future because of droughts and stuff,\u201d Ide said. \u201cThis scares investors away. People don\u2019t want to invest there anymore because they\u2019re scared these places are biased, or immature, or barbaric.\u201d Ide also fretted that this will encourage Western philanthropists or militaries to unseat local power in these countries, in effect saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it on your own, so we have to move in and manage your resources.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that everyone who focuses on climate change in Syria or Kenya is automatically promoting colonial behavior, but if there\u2019s a connective frame it might well facilitate this kind of thinking,\u201d he told me. Ide demurred when I asked where this kind of climate-science-driven colonialism has already happened. \u201cIf it comes to proving that a certain academic framing had an influence on people\u2019s mind-set, or eventually even actions or policies, that\u2019s really hard to pin down or prove empirically. People don\u2019t just read academic studies\u2014they watch television, they listen to peers,\u201d he said. But he also said that the push to fortify southern Europe and adopt much more regressive immigration policies was driven, in part, by the climate literature. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard from colleagues working on the issue, the idea that climate change is leading to conflict and migration in the Middle East\u2014that is used by some conservatives and lobbyists and politicians in Brussels to inform stricter border controls in the south of the European Union, like not saving [refugees] in the Mediterranean Sea,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s still anecdotal evidence, but it\u2019s there.\u201d His paper fits into a broader pattern of researchers\u2014especially those in Europe\u2014rejecting links between global warming and war. Selby, the Sussex professor, and a number of his colleagues published a blistering article last year attacking the idea that a climate-addled drought in any way pushed Syria into war. It argued that a prewar drought\u2014which supposedly prompted the country\u2019s economic chaos\u2014was not as historically anomalous as claimed; and that the farmers who fled that drought had little involvement in the run-up to the war itself. He called the new article \u201ca decent paper\u201d without \u201cobvious flaws.\u201d \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s probably to some extent because it confirms suspicions that I have anyway,\u201d he said. He told me that there was \u201cno consensus\u201d in the quantitative literature on whether climate change exacerbates conflict. \u201cSome people claim there is a consensus, but they only do so by ignoring a huge amount of literature and standing on what I think are spurious methodological grounds.\u201d He said that conflict-climate scholars should study climate-vulnerable places where there has been no conflict as well as war zones. \u201cIf you go study in Costa Rica or Greenland, for example, then you will find a different correlation. And it will make the case as well.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything novel or particularly unusual in [the new paper],\u201d says Simon Dalby , a professor of politics and climate change at the Balsillie School of International Affairs. \u201cThe focus on Africa\u2014 Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa \u2014has been noted for years by those of us tracking this. And the \u2018street lighting\u2019 point is well taken. Kenya is easier to get into for lots of folks doing the research, who are mostly white-skinned Northerners who speak English,\u201d he says. Dalby takes something of a middle ground on the dispute. Going back to the 1990s, he says, a body of literature has \u201cmade it clear that environmental change might\u2014in some complicated series of circumstances\u2014lead to conflict, but it was the intervening circumstances that really mattered.\u201d Another researcher who has harped on the focus on Africa is Solomon Hsiang , an economist and professor of public policy at UC Berkeley. In 2013, he and his colleagues noted the preponderance of Africa-focused research in a now-famous study that argued there was an empirical link between conflict and climate change. For every change of a standard deviation in temperature or rainfall, he and his colleagues found that the chance of violent conflict between groups rose by 14 percent. \u201cThere is nothing really surprising or new in this study,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cStudying conflict-prone regions isn\u2019t a problem, it\u2019s what you would expect. Nobody is studying Ebola outbreaks by studying why Ebola is not breaking out in caf\u00e9s in Sydney today, we study what happened in West Africa when there was an actual event.\u201d Hsiang also lambasted the article\u2019s method of analyzing the literature as a whole to claim that researchers \u201c[overstate] the links between\u201d conflict and climate change. \u201cThe biggest issue with the study is that they strongly insinuate there is some kind of bias boogeyman in the research field without actually showing that anybody else who came before made an error or demonstrating how their idea could affect findings in the field,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are vague and imprecise about their critique of prior work, without identifying which actual findings they are overturning or replicating anybody\u2019s work. Instead, they simply allude to an aroma of a problem in the research field, which sows doubt without providing actual evidence.\u201d The article itself appears to back off its claims by the end of the paper, saying that its findings are not intended to discredit any one researcher or study. \u201cWe are not saying that the correlations are invalid or invaluable, nor are we accusing any studies or authors who have focused on specific regions,\u201d Ide told me. But the paper nonetheless claims that the conflict-climate link is overstated. Chalecki, the University of Nebraska political scientist, also finds the paper\u2019s focus odd. It makes sense to study places where there is war, she says: \u201cViolence isn\u2019t an inherent condition in domestic politics or international politics. We don\u2019t need to explain peace. It\u2019s conflict, it\u2019s war, that we need to explain.\u201d She also wonders if the \u201cstreetlight effect\u201d that preoccupied the authors was simply a tendency of academia, since authors tend to cite prior work on a topic. Academics focus on war zones because it matters how the war starts, she says. \u201cIn terms of policy-relevant research, I don\u2019t think there is anything in this article that might help a country or region offset climate change,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I\u2019m talking to an undersecretary of defense, or a policy maker, they\u2019re gonna look at this [paper] and say ... what does this even mean?\u201d \u201cI thought it was a weird article,\u201d says Greg Petrow, another political scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, who specializes in quantitative methods. He says the paper\u2014which focuses on sampling bias in the field\u2014suffered from sampling bias itself. \u201cThey\u2019re not really directly assessing what they want to be assessing. They\u2019re trying to assess sampling bias, but they\u2019re looking at the sampling as a dependent variable. They\u2019re actually looking at publication bias as an independent variable,\u201d he says. There are papers that study publication bias, he added, but they don\u2019t cite or refer to them. In an email, Ide pushed back on some of these criticisms, saying that a peaceful \u201ccontrol\u201d population was more useful than a study on Ebola in Sydney coffee shops. \u201cMost studies on cancer, for instance, include a large number of different people not suffering from cancer as control cases in order to avoid premature conclusions, but also to identify the factors which make people resilient to cancer,\u201d he said. \u201c I think the same logic should apply to climate-conflict research.\u201d Above all, he said, his paper showed how much more scholarship on the link can still be done. \u201cI was a bit surprised that even within American studies, there\u2019s not really a focus on Latin America, basically,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can be concerned about Iraq, Syria, or India because of geopolitical relevance\u2014but why not look for [climate-related conflict] in Mexico, or Honduras, or Brazil? Because that would have much sharper consequences for the United States.\u201d These gaps may even have policy implications. \u201cIf I were a decision maker in Washington, D.C., concerned about climate change and conflict, I would like to know whether our knowledge on the issue rests on a solid foundation, and I would be rather concerned to learn that we know a lot about Kenya in this context, but very little about vulnerable countries in the U.S.A.\u2019s neighborhood, such as Mexico and Honduras.\u201d Dalby, the political scientist, tried to take a broader view of the dispute\u2014and of the climatic upheaval that could come later this century. \u201cLooking for these empirical connections is all very well and good,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut if you\u2019re looking for the causes of climate change, it\u2019s us\u2014the overconsuming, fossil-fuel-burning North and West. If you want to get serious about climate change, worrying about the small-scale details of conflicts in Africa is missing the point. It\u2019s us.\u201d","headline":"Does Climate Change Cause More War?

{"id":null,"body":"Smoggy-looking daguerreotypes in 19th-century London foreshadowed today\u2019s muted smartphone photos of California fires. I knew something was wrong the minute I woke up. On September 9, the sky was still dark at 7:15 a.m. Eventually it revealed a deep-orange light, darker and dustier than any sunset. After a dry lightning storm in late August had sparked more than 900 fires around California, high-altitude smoke hung over the San Francisco Bay Area. I took a photo out the window with my iPhone. It wasn\u2019t right. I tried again, tapping the screen and dragging the exposure slider down. Still, the tawny orange of the sky didn\u2019t register. The iPhone rendered it a pale yellow, the foreboding automatically corrected by the camera\u2019s built-in software. Manually fiddling with the controls, I darkened a few images and increased the warmth. Then I watched as my Instagram and Twitter feeds filled up with n early identical views from all around the Bay Area, many accompanied by captions describing the difficulty of taking the picture. No software engineer had predicted this apocalyptic scenography\u2014created by an unusually active fire season that kept consuming forests deep into November. So phone cameras had busily corrected the unnatural view, making it seem more like a pretty picture rather than what it was: a terrifying and true example of the effects of human-generated climate change. Read: Your phone wasn\u2019t built for the apocalypse News articles portrayed smartphone photographers\u2019 dilemma as something of a novelty. The San Francisco Chronicle quickly published an explainer online: \u201c Why your phone camera can\u2019t capture Northern California\u2019s orange sky .\u201d Yet anthropogenic forces reshaping the environment have flummoxed photographers before. Many improvements in photographic technology aim to enhance what we see, offering up the world as we imagine it or want it to be. Sometimes we struggle to understand the gulf between the representation and the gross reality before our eyes. Sometimes photos help us understand a changing climate; sometimes they obscure it. In the mid-19th century, England\u2019s infamous industrial smog was blamed for the poor quality of early photographs made there. Daguerreotypes, the first publicly available photographic process, can possess exceptional detail and luminosity , but critics at the time found English daguerreotypes dark and ill-defined. At the first World\u2019s Fair, held at London\u2019s Crystal Palace in 1851, American photographers won three of the five medals awarded to daguerreotypes. One correspondent from the United States wrote of the exhibition: \u201cThe excellence of American pictures is evident, which is to be accounted for by several reasons. In the first place, American skies are freer from fog and clouds\u2014from bituminous coal not being much used, the atmosphere of our cities is free from smoke.\u201d The smoke and industrial \u201cfog\u201d of London (the catchall term used for fog and smog in the 19th century) appeared frequently in descriptions of the city. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House of the \u201csmoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes\u2014gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.\u201d Oscar Wilde cited \u201cthe yellow fog\u201d in his poem \u201cImpressions du Matin.\u201d Despite the foul-smelling evil gloom of the fog, Claude Monet relished its effect on the light . He wrote in a letter: \u201cI can\u2019t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One marvel after another, each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.\u201d Critics of English daguerreotypes blamed the smoggy skies for shadowy pictures, even those made indoors, such as portraits. However, American photographers who set up shop in London didn\u2019t have the same problem. John Jabez Edwin Mayall, a successful Philadelphia photographer, relocated his studio to London in 1846, where he became known for the quality of his large-scale portraits . One photographic journalist wrote in 1853: \u201cMayall is known as the \u2018American Daguerreotypist,\u2019 and is considered about the best in London. His specimens are certainly proof that the fogs of London are not the cause of Daguerreotypists failing in procuring clear pictures; for many of his are equal to the best ever taken.\u201d Read: We are running out of air Many photographic chemicals produced by American manufacturers and sold in Europe referred to their country of origin in the brand name, such as \u201cWolcott\u2019s American Mixture,\u201d a chemical solution that increased the light sensitivity of the daguerreotype plate. Greater sensitivity to light meant that pictures could be taken more rapidly, thereby improving the sharpness and definition of the image. Electroplating, which increased the brightness of the plate through the addition of extra silver layers, was described as \u201cthe American process.\u201d The bitter irony is that chemical innovations in the United States would later contribute to the country\u2019s own pollution problems. Even though the American products and processes were well known, some critics held fast to the smog hypothesis. Not only was it a good excuse for the British photographers in an era of intense national competition, but the chemical failures of their daguerreotypes also looked uncannily like the dark clouds witnessed in London. Only a dozen years after the first public announcement of photography, people already believed that the medium should represent the world as they saw it. This summer and fall, amateur photographers in California looked for technological tips to make their smartphone photos more accurately represent the smoke-obscured skies. Smartphones and other consumer-grade cameras offer a series of preset color temperatures: deep shade, open shade, bright sun, and fluorescent and tungsten lighting. Will your next phone include a setting for \u201cwildfire sky\u201d as it becomes a new reality, at least in the western United States? Seven of California\u2019s 10 largest fires in recorded history have occurred within the past three years, five of them since August of this year. In the 19th century, critics were so alert to the presence of air pollution that they erroneously thought it was affecting their photographs. But today, our cameras seem to deny that such anthropogenic weather even exists. A simple software fix could rectify that. Alongside all the other white-balance icons\u2014pictures of the sun, a building in shade, and a lightbulb\u2014wildfire sky could be represented by the burning of fossil fuels: smokestacks, airplanes, exhaust pipes, just so there\u2019s no mistaking this tragic sight for an extraordinary one, as Monet did. A smartphone camera is an aide-m\u00e9moire. Not only do we use it to record major events and milestones, but we snap thousands of pictures of What\u2019s for dinner? , There\u2019s my dog , Here are my feet , and reminders, such as Buy this brand of shampoo for me, please . Several months from now, when California is green and gorgeous again, the dusty-orange photos from this fall will show up in residents\u2019 otherwise banal photo libraries. Read: This is your life on climate change In contrast, disappearance was almost a natural part of the 19th-century photograph\u2019s life cycle, so we have few surviving examples of bad British daguerreotypes, which looked so smoggy to critics. These historic pictures may have vanished because of poor chemical fixing, or perhaps they were discarded because they just weren\u2019t good enough to keep. In the 21st century, our trillions of photographs\u2014good and bad, true and false representations\u2014just might outlast us all. Adding a wildfire-sky white-balance setting may feel too much like giving up, like accepting our fate. But these devastating weather events will most certainly continue. Climate-related catastrophes will also worsen, unless we accept responsibility for them and change behavior on a global scale. For that, we need to remember their terrible impact on our daily lives; we need to see the orange glow casting a pall over all the other memories in its midst.","headline":"Photography Has Gotten Climate Change Wrong From the Start","article_name":617224.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/11\/photography-has-never-known-how-handle-climate-change\/617224\/","date_published":"2020-11-27 11:30:00","article_length":8114,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:03.055758","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/11\/photography-has-never-known-how-handle-climate-change\/617224\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Key takeaways from the Vatican's encyclical on climate change. Pope Francis has unveiled an encyclical \u2014a rare and influential Vatican statement\u2014on climate change and the environment. The highly anticipated document says that global warming is real, is caused partly by human activity, and is a grave threat to humanity. The Vatican hopes it will pave the way for a strong international climate deal later this year when diplomats descend on Paris for United Nations talks. But Pope Francis wants the encyclical to be read by everyone \u2014and the Vatican hopes that the document will influence much more than just the Paris talks. And just so his message is clear, the Vatican's official Twitter account, @Pontifex , has been active Thursday morning with blunt views from the pope. \"The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,\" reads one tweet . ( RELATED: Pope Francis Calls For 'Cultural Revolution' Over Climate Change ) Here are six key points from the encyclical. Population Control Is Not the Answer For Pope Francis, caring about the environment goes hand in hand with taking a strong stand against abortion. \"Since everything is interrelated, concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion,\" the encyclical says. \"How can we genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties?\" Francis suggests that efforts to slow population growth are misguided and a distraction from the underlying cause of the world's environmental crisis\u2014the hoarding of the Earth's resources by the rich and powerful. \"To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues,\" the encyclical says. This Isn't Just About the Environment While the encyclical is centered around climate change and the environment, the overall message takes broad swipes at the consumer culture and calls for humans to cut back. \"We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something that we have created ourselves,\" Francis writes, one of several times he warns about the dangers of technology created without a thought to its long-term impacts. ( RELATED: What Congress Wants to Hear From Pope Francis ) The encyclical also takes a broad look at humans' overall relationships with each other, saying that development in the last century has \"not always led to an integral development and an improvement in the quality of life\" and highlighting effects like social aggression and drug use. Even the digital revolution gets a mention: \"Today's media do enable us to communicate and to share our knowledge and affections. Yet at times they also shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears, and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experiences.\" International Action Is Needed, But Only the Right Kind The encyclical says that governments need to think as \"one world with a common plan,\" saying that individual nations may not always act in everyone's interest or have enforceable measures on their own. But Francis also expresses disappointment with international negotiators in the past, saying that 2012 talks in Rio de Janiero only produced \"a wide-ranging but ineffectual outcome document,\" in part because developed countries were only thinking of their own self-interests. Other more narrow agreements, like the Basel Convention on hazardous waste or the Vienna Convention on the ozone layer have been more effective, though. But Francis says that only the right kind of international deal can produce results. An agreement that imposes the same responsibility on all countries regardless of their development level, he says, would penalize the Third World. That acknowledges\u2014but does not necessarily solve\u2014one of the biggest hang-ups in previous international talks, where developing countries have balked at massive reduction targets. \"Common and differentiated responsibilities\" will have to be considered in the Paris talks, Francis says, to help developing countries. One solution that Francis swiftly dismisses is a deal that would use carbon credits in a cap-and-trade scenario. That solution would not \"allow for the radical change that present circumstances require,\" he says, adding that it \"may simply become a ploy that permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors.\" The Water Crisis Is Real, So Put Down That Bottled Water Francis\u2014the first pope from the developing world\u2014highlights the broad impact that climate change is having on the poor, but he takes steps to emphasize some specific impacts. One chapter looks at the water crisis, saying that global warming has depleted freshwater resources, while industrial activity and chemical pollution has polluted drinking water in poor places. Building on the theme of limiting consumption, Francis laments that, \"in some places, there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity, to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market.\" A water shortage could have huge ramifications for agriculture and public health, he says, adding, \"It is also conceivable that the control of water by large multinational businesses may become a major source of conflict in this century.\" Pesticides Pollute and GMOs Are a Complex Issue Francis takes on pesticides in a section of the encyclical focused on \"pollution, waste, and the throwaway culture.\" After noting that daily exposure to pollutants can create serious and even deadly health risks, the pope says that \"fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and agrotoxins in general\" cause pollution that impacts everyone. Francis also delves into the controversy over genetically modified organisms. The pope notes that genetic modification of plants and animals is not a new phenomenon but one that exists in nature and has also been carried out by humans for years. \"It is difficult to make a general judgement about genetic modification (GM),\" the encyclical says. ( RELATED: Pope Francis Is Coming to Congress in September ) But Francis still strikes a note of caution: \"Although no conclusive proof exists that GM cereals may be harmful to human beings, and in some regions their use has brought about economic growth that has helped to resolve problems, there remain a number of significant difficulties that should not be underestimated.\" Francis warns that \"the expansion of these crops has the effect of destroying the complex network of ecosystems [and] diminishing the diversity of production.\" The Pope Thinks You Should Ride the Bus Francis links the quality of life in cities to how we get around. Too many cars on the road cause traffic jams and pollution and suck up fossil fuels, the encyclical notes, adding that overreliance on cars also leads to the construction of more roads and the paving over of the natural environment to create parking lots. Riding the bus or the metro may be the antidote, the encyclical suggests. \"Many specialists agree on the need to give priority to public transportation,\" the document reads, while praising the efforts that some countries have made in recent years to improve their public-transit networks.","headline":"Pope Francis: Climate Change and Abortion Are \"\u02dcInterrelated' ","article_name":443652.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-climate-change-and-abortion-are-interrelated\/443652\/","date_published":"2015-06-18 08:45:00","article_length":7413,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:03.301503","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-climate-change-and-abortion-are-interrelated\/443652\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It's already looking like Phil Jones will not return to his position as the head of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, because of his attempts to thwart a Freedom of Information request.\u00a0 But today the Guardian is reporting that its research into the emails reveals even more serious violations--misconduct that calls his scientific work into question: Jones and a collaborator have been accused by a climate change sceptic and researcher of scientific fraud for attempting to suppress data that could cast doubt on a key 1990 study on the effect of cities on warming - a hotly contested issue. Today the Guardian reveals how Jones withheld the information requested under freedom of information laws. Subsequently a senior colleague told him he feared that Jones's collaborator, Wei-\u00adChyung Wang of the University at Albany, had \"screwed up\". The revelations on the inadequacies of the 1990 paper do not undermine the case that humans are causing climate change, and other studies have produced similar findings. But they do call into question the probity of some climate change science. The apparent attempts to cover up problems with temperature data from the Chinese weather stations provide the first link between the email scandal and the UN's embattled climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as a paper based on the measurements was used to bolster IPCC statements about rapid global warming in recent decades. Wang was cleared of scientific fraud by his university, but new information brought to light today indicates at least one senior colleague had serious concerns about the affair. It also emerges that documents which Wang claimed would exonerate him and Jones did not exist. The article in question is incredibly poorly written--short on details, and cryptic in its explanations.\u00a0 So I withhold judgement as to whether this is a major issue.\u00a0 But it is from the Guardian, not some right-wing paper with an anti-AGW agenda.\u00a0 So I expect there will be some follow-up.","headline":"Climate Change Emails Show Evidence of Scientific Misconduct?","article_name":35184.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2010\/02\/climate-change-emails-show-evidence-of-scientific-misconduct\/35184\/","date_published":"2010-02-02 15:58:32","article_length":2031,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:04.005457","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2010\/02\/climate-change-emails-show-evidence-of-scientific-misconduct\/35184\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"An oceanic cold spot breathes life into the archipelago. How long can it last? This article was originally published by Hakai Magazine . As a result of climate change, almost every part of the ocean is heating up. But off the west coast of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is a patch of cold, nutrient-rich water. This prosperous patch feeds phytoplankton and breathes life into the archipelago. \u201cThe cool water sustains populations of penguins, marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, and cetaceans that would not be able to stay on the equator year-round,\u201d says Judith Denkinger, a marine ecologist at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador. Over the past four decades, this cold patch has cooled by roughly half a degree. Its persistence has scientists wondering how long that will hold. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are already famed for their biodiversity. Could it be that the water offshore will become a refuge for marine animals seeking a cold environment in a warming world? The answer, it seems, is yes\u2014at least for a while. There are other cold pools on the planet. One, in the North Atlantic just south of Greenland, is caused by the weakening of a global current that carries heat north. But according to a new study led by Kris Karnauskas and Donata Giglio, climate scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Gal\u00e1pagos cold pool is a product of the topography of the island\u2014something unlikely to change because of rising greenhouse gases. Read: We created the \u2018Pandemicene\u2019 And the Gal\u00e1pagos are not the only islands seeing this effect. Along the equator, several islands have unusually cold water lying immediately to their west. According to Karnauskas and Giglio\u2019s work, this cooling is the product of upwelling caused by the collision of a deep ocean current against the islands in its path. Analyzing 22 years\u2019 worth of ocean-temperature data collected by Argo floats , along with observations from satellites and cruises, the scientists constructed temperature profiles around several equatorial islands and pinpointed the location of the Equatorial Undercurrent\u2014a cold, fast-flowing current that travels eastward about 100 meters below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The EUC is held in place along the equator by the Coriolis Effect, an inertial force brought on by the Earth\u2019s rotation. This same effect twists hurricanes anticlockwise north of the equator and clockwise south of it. Karnauskas and Giglio\u2019s work shows that when the EUC gets within 100 kilometers west of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, it suddenly intensifies as it\u2019s diverted upward by the islands. This causes the water in this cold pool to generally be more than 1 degree Celsius cooler than the water outside. The researchers found a similar but weaker effect west of the Gilbert Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. In a separate study, Karnauskas found that over the past few decades, the EUC has been getting stronger and deeper. It has also moved about 10 kilometers south, bringing its path more in line with the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. All of those changes contribute to the observed cooling, Karnauskas says. For the Gal\u00e1pagos marine ecosystem, this cooling is \u201ca bit of a mixed bag,\u201d says Jon Witman, a marine ecologist at Brown University who was not involved in the studies. \u201cThe cool upwelled water of the EUC certainly has important positive impacts,\u201d he says. But when combined with other oceanic processes that also cause temperatures to drop, such as La Ni\u00f1a, the cooling can hurt certain wildlife, including by cold-shocking corals, causing them to bleach and sometimes die. Read: Scientists can no longer ignore ancient flooding tales For the near future, this shield of cold will likely benefit life around the Gal\u00e1pagos and other equatorial islands. But it is fighting a losing battle with a warming atmosphere, Karnauskas says: \u201cThis cooling trend probably won\u2019t last through the century; it will eventually be overwhelmed.\u201d If some species are protected for at least a while, however, the Gal\u00e1pagos could become a genetic bank that could be used to reseed devastated marine ecosystems elsewhere, Karnauskas suggests: \u201cAnd it\u2019s just beautiful that it\u2019s the iconic Gal\u00e1pagos that we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d","headline":"The Gal\u00e1pagos\u2019s Secret Weapon Against Climate Change","article_name":672183.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/11\/galapagos-islands-climate-change-cold-water\/672183\/","date_published":"2022-11-19 13:00:00","article_length":4216,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:04.621104","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/11\/galapagos-islands-climate-change-cold-water\/672183\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In the past few years, the American Petroleum Institute and its allies have fought against climate-friendly policies in at least 16 different states. Some of the most important fights over climate change aren\u2019t being waged in Washington. They\u2019re happening state by state, in a melee of utilities, fossil-fuel companies, state legislators, and persuaded voters. To see one in action, visit Beaver, Pennsylvania, where two Westinghouse nuclear reactors produce roughly a fifth of the Keystone State\u2019s zero-carbon electricity. Three years ago, FirstEnergy Corporation, a private utility worth $28 billion , announced that it would soon have to sell the nuclear plants or shut them down. Even though the reactors were supposed to operate for another few decades, the plunging cost of natural gas had made them noncompetitive. Only direct subsidies could keep the plants alive, the utility warned. State lawmakers had not even proposed a bill floating that option when a new group called Citizens Against Nuclear Bailouts burst onto the scene. Boasting support from local manufacturers and, unexpectedly, the AARP, the group told local reporters that it opposed \u201cany legislative effort\u201d to subsidize the plants. At the same time, a micro-targeted group of Pennsylvanians received a deluge of direct mailers, phone calls, and Facebook ads, exhorting them to call state senators to oppose a \u201cnuke bailout.\u201d \u201cThese billion dollar companies don\u2019t need bailouts, they need to compete with other energy companies on a level playing field,\u201d said one postcard-size mailer. A small disclosure on the mailers revealed that they had, in fact, not come from a group of self-organized Pennsylvanians. The mailers were funded and shipped by the American Petroleum Institute, the lobbying champion for oil and natural-gas companies in national politics. The return address on the mailers was one of the group\u2019s offices in downtown Washington, D.C. Three years ago, after Donald Trump\u2019s election, climate activists and environmental leaders turned their attention to state and local politics. They have stacked up real victories since. In December, a bipartisan group of 24 governors declared that their states were \u201cstill in\u201d the Paris Agreement on climate change. And Democrats in New York , New Jersey , and Washington State have passed major bills aimed at eliminating carbon pollution from their local economies. But climate activists have not been alone in switching focus to local politics: The oil industry has also pivoted. In the past few years, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and its allies have activated at the local level, fighting against\u2014and occasionally beating back\u2014climate-friendly policies in at least 16 different states. This surge of local activism has succeeded in slowing the growth of electric-vehicle sales and zero-carbon energy, experts say. Perhaps most surprising, the industry has not only focused on the states, but also actually borrowed tactics and ideas from climate activists. The API\u2019s local campaign is designed around a concept\u2014dubbed the social license to operate\u2014 that was first invented by risk analysts in the mining industry but that was popularized, more recently, by far-left climate groups such as 350.org . The idea is a name for American society\u2019s invisible permission slip to the fossil-fuel industry: the unwritten contract that allows companies to frack, drill, build pipelines, run oil refineries, and sell carbon-intensive fuels. Since the mid-2010s, climate activists have focused on yanking that social license away. Now, the oil industry is pouring resources into an effort to retain it. Its activities \u201care having a tangible impact in preventing zero-carbon electricity and zero-carbon electric vehicles from getting adopted,\u201d Josh Freed, the senior vice president of energy policy at Third Way, a nonpartisan think tank on the center-left, told me. In a statement, Bethany Aronhalt, a spokesperson for API, said that the oil and gas industry supported \u201cnew approaches, policies, and technological innovation to address the risks of climate change.\u201d She listed a few policies\u2014including the USE IT Act , a bipartisan Senate bill\u2014that have won API\u2019s endorsement. The USE IT Act would increase federal support both for capturing carbon from the atmosphere and for using that carbon to make fossil-fuel extraction more efficient. Last month, the API unveiled a huge new public-relations campaign, \u201cEnergy for Progress,\u201d that cast its member companies as heroes in the fight against climate change. The campaign, which features images of happy young people in the woods, accompanied a systematic change in how API described itself. Its leaders now say it represents the natural gas and oil industry\u2014with a big emphasis on the natural. But despite this new push, API does not support a carbon tax or any other policy that would reduce fossil-fuel use. And at the state level, few climate-friendly efforts have escaped the attention of API or the broader oil industry. In 11 states, the industry has fought new laws that encourage electric-car purchases. In five states, it has campaigned against extending the life of nuclear plants, which generate more zero-carbon electricity in the United States than any other technology. And across the Northeast, it has tried to stop the construction of transmission lines that would import excess hydroelectric power from Quebec. Of course, there are practical reasons for API to oppose such climate policy. Right now, API\u2019s member companies command a massive market share of several sectors of the American economy. Gasoline and other oil-derived products generate 92 percent of the energy used to transport Americans and their goods\u2014whether on the highway, on the water, or in the air, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas generates more than a third of American electricity , and plunging prices mean that its share is rapidly growing. Read: Investment bankers are now waging a war on coal Every electric vehicle on the road cuts into oil\u2019s share of the transportation sector. By the same token, every retired nuclear plant necessitates a new surge of natural-gas production. \u201cThe oil and natural gas that are staying in the market from [API\u2019s actions] are much worse\u201d than the alternatives, Freed said. The industry\u2019s wake-up call may have come in 2018, when it faced two ballot questions in western states. In Colorado, voters were asked whether new oil and gas equipment, including fracking wells, should be set back 2,500 feet from homes and other occupied buildings. The industry plowed $41 million into defeating the question\u2014and eventually won, persuading 55 percent of voters in the Democratic state to reject the effort. In Washington State, meanwhile, the industry dropped $31 million to fight a carbon-tax referendum , outspending supporters almost two-to-one. That effort\u2014which was led by the Western States Petroleum Association, which works closely with API\u2014also succeeded. In the past several years, the oil industry has also worked with groups funded by the Koch Foundation to engineer a nationwide decline in financial support for electric-vehicle sales. Today, only 15 states offer subsidies or support for electric-car buyers, down from an all-time high of about two dozen states in 2015 . ( The New York Times and Politico have both previously covered the state-by-state fight over EVs.) In many of its campaigns, the API has designed its approach around the social-license model, which has meant seeking legitimation from a surprising range of allies. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, it worked with the AARP and the United Pastors Network. While lobbying for new fossil-fuel infrastructure, it has allied with the Building Trades Unions and the Farm Bureau. And in its war against importing Canadian hydropower, it has even allied with local chapters of the Sierra Club. \u201cDiversity is paramount,\u201d said Tara Anderson, a former director of mobilization for API, two years ago, at a presentation on API\u2019s strategy at the Public Affairs Council . She emphasized the importance of forming alliances with minority and citizens groups, according to her PowerPoint presentation. \u201cJust because you disagree on one issue, doesn\u2019t mean you will disagree on all\u2014accept that,\u201d the presentation said. API sees those coalitions as core to its social-license strategy. It has backed up its push with digital advertising and local engagement. In 2018, Anderson said that API could micro-target 43 million people in every congressional district. API has spent more than $1.9 million on Facebook ads over the past two years, with the large majority of that centered on \u201cEnergy Citizens,\u201d a sophisticated campaign to convert people into highly activated opponents of energy regulation. Since October, the campaign\u2019s targeted Facebook ads have encouraged New Mexicans to support a state-highway bill, exhorted Pennsylvanians to reject an infrastructure bill, and endorsed President Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Energy Citizens had 1.6 million members in 2018, according to Anderson\u2019s presentation. In a statement, Aronhalt, the API spokesperson, described Energy Citizens as a \u201cgrowing grassroots movement of millions of Americans across the country.\u201d Read: Railroads are a major but little-known supporter of climate denial But API has not won every fight. Last month, New Jersey passed a new $5,000 tax credit for electric cars, one of the country\u2019s most generous. And it has failed to stop efforts to subsidize nuclear plants in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. It also lost an effort to subsidize coal and nuclear power plants in Ohio. (\u201cEvery local effort is unique since every policy proposal, bill and regulation is,\u201d said Aronhalt. \u201cWe work to support, amend, or oppose various local, state, and federal efforts on an ongoing basis.\u201d) \u201cIn cooperation with API\u2019s state petroleum councils, allied organizations, and partner trade associations, energy advocates sign up through social media [or through its website]  to receive customized content to make their voice known by contacting or engaging elected officials. API facilitates the grassroots website and supports events to connect those who might be interested in energy issues in their state,\u201d she said. Yet the extent and intensity of API\u2019s work at the local level is a significant break with the past, experts say. \u201cThis is a new development,\u201d Leah Stokes, a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara, told me. She studies how state governments have adopted climate policy\u2014or not adopted it\u2014over the past few decades. Historically, it\u2019s been rare for API to fight against nuclear plants or block electricity infrastructure, she said. But it has gotten more involved in electricity policy since 2016, when it absorbed the American Natural Gas Alliance, the gas industry\u2019s main trade group. While oil makes up a small share of the American power mix, natural gas plays a dominant role. But even if that merger had not gone through, oil and gas have unified interests right now, Stokes said. Both oil and natural gas are now extracted by the same companies, using the same fracking techniques, drilling in the same places. \u201cGas is coming up because of fracking, but oil is too. It\u2019s possible [API] views electricity infrastructure as an important avenue for oil and gas in the future,\u201d she said. That future is nearly a reality in Pennsylvania. State lawmakers and public-utility commissioners both rejected new subsidies for the two nuclear reactors in Beaver. The plants are due to close in 2021. They will join in the dustheap the state\u2019s infamous Three Mile Island plant , which also closed last year. The electricity once generated by both nuclear plants will now likely come from natural gas. And thus the heat-trapping climate pollution emitted by Pennsylvanians will increase.","headline":"The Oil Industry Is Quietly Winning Local Climate Fights","article_name":606640.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/02\/oil-industry-fighting-climate-policy-states\/606640\/","date_published":"2020-02-20 17:55:57","article_length":11878,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:05.160208","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/02\/oil-industry-fighting-climate-policy-states\/606640\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Why it's so hard to talk about the worst problem in the world No one knows how to talk about climate change right now. I don\u2019t have an idea about where to begin, and I write about it professionally. On the one hand, the natural consequences of climate change seem increasingly severe and devastating. Just in the past two years, I\u2019ve written about how global warming will probably cause more mega-droughts in Arizona and New Mexico; how dangerously sweltering summer days are three times likelier to occur today than they were in 1900 ; and how even slightly warmer oceans will destroy the Great Barrier Reef . On the other hand, a strategy for addressing climate change is coming together. The cost of solar and wind energy are plunging worldwide ; carmakers are promising to take more of their fleet electric , and the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from human activity has stabilized over the past three years . Decarbonizing will be an arduous and difficult global project\u2014but technological development and government policy are finally bringing it into the realm of the possible. But on the other, other hand, the Trump administration is methodically and successfully undermining the substance of American climate policy. It has spread untruths about climate science, abandoned the Paris Agreement , and stricken dozens of climate-focused EPA rules from the law books . Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton professor who has observed climate diplomacy for 30 years, told me that this is one of the most dispiriting moments he can remember\u2014and that he believes Earth is now doomed to warm by more than two degrees Celsius . That\u2019s the state of the world right now. There are three ongoing shifts and no easy way to synthesize them. The facts don\u2019t lend themselves to an overwhelming vision. Instead, they suggest that the planet\u2019s economic system is in the middle of a difficult and supremely important political battle with itself. As Brad Plumer, a New York Times climate reporter, tweeted last week : There are \u201ctwo radically opposed visions of the future; [it\u2019s] not yet clear which one will win out.\u201d It\u2019s into that morass that this week\u2019s New York magazine walks. In a widely shared article, David Wallace-Wells sketches the bleakest possible scenario for global warming . He warns of a planet so awash in greenhouse gas that Brooklyn\u2019s heat waves will rival Bahrain\u2019s. The breadbaskets of China and the United States will enter a debilitating and everlasting drought, he says. And millions of brains will so lack oxygen that they\u2019ll slip into a carbon-induced confusion. Unless we take aggressive action, \u201cparts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century,\u201d he writes. \u201cNo matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.\u201d It\u2019s a scary vision\u2014which is okay, because climate change is scary. It is also an unusually specific and severe depiction of what global warming will do to the planet. And though Wallace-Wells makes it clear that he\u2019s not predicting the future, only trying to spin out the consequences of the best available science today, it\u2019s fair to ask: Is it realistic? Will this heat-wracked doomsday come to pass? Many climate scientists and professional science communicators say no. Wallace-Wells\u2019s article, they say, often flies beyond the realm of what researchers think is likely. I have to agree with them. At key points in his piece, Wallace-Wells posits facts that mainstream climate science cannot support. In the introduction, he suggests that the world\u2019s permafrost will belch all of its methane into the atmosphere as it melts, accelerating the planet\u2019s warming in the decades to come. We don\u2019t know everything about methane yet, but the picture does not seem this bleak. Melting permafrost will emit methane, and methane is an ultra-potent greenhouse gas, but scientists do not think so much it will escape in the coming century. \u201cThe science on this is much more nuanced and doesn\u2019t support the notion of a game-changing, planet-melting methane bomb,\u201d writes Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State , in a Facebook post. \u201cIt is unclear that much of this frozen methane can be readily mobilized by projected warming.\u201d At other points, Wallace-Wells misstates what we know about the climate change that has already happened. Satellite data does not show that the world has warmed twice as fast as scientists thought, as he says; rather, the observed warming has tracked pretty close to what the models predicted. Carbon-dioxide levels only get high enough to seriously depress brain function in indoor spaces, though he implies it will become a global problem. Most importantly, we do not know nearly as much about climate change and war as he claims\u2014an idea that I will return to in a moment. This isn\u2019t to say that his piece is worth discarding in its entirety. Wallace-Wells paints a vivid and frightening version of a doomed world. Many scientists just don\u2019t think we live in that world\u2014and they don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to tell people that we do. Over the past decade, most researchers have trended away from climate doomsdayism. They cite research suggesting that people respond better to hopeful messages, not fatalistic ones; and they meticulously fact-check public descriptions of global warming, as watchful for unsupported exaggeration as they are for climate-change denial. They do this not because they think that climate change will be peachy. They do it because they want to be exceptionally careful with facts for such a vital issue. And many of them, too, think that a climate-changed world will look less like a starved wasteland and more like our current home\u2014just more unequal and more impoverished. What does that world look like? We got a fairly good look late last month, actually, when a new consortium of economists and scientists called the Climate Impact Lab published their first study in the journal Science . Their research looks at how global warming will afflict Americans economically, on a county-by-county level. It tells a frightening but much more mundane story. Climate change, they say, will not turn us into idiots before broiling us in our sleep. Instead, it will act as a kind of ecological reverse Robin Hood , stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. It will impoverish many of the poorest communities in the country\u2014arrayed across the South and Southwest, and especially along the Gulf Coast\u2014while increasing the fortunes of cities and suburbs on both of the coasts. \u201cThis study\u2014the climate equivalent of being informed that smoking carries serious risk of lung cancer\u2014should be enough to motivate us,\u201d says Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and professor of political science at Texas Tech University. \u201cThe NYMag article is the climate equivalent of being told that everyone in the world\u2019s life will end in the most grisly, worst-case possible scenario if we keep on smoking.\u201d The Climate Impact Labs\u2019 accounting is a much likelier view of what is \u201cmuch more likely to occur than the doomsday scenario,\u201d she added. Other communicators reject Wallace-Wells\u2019s approach for a third reason: He glosses over the many reasons that climate advocates now have hope. Many of these criticisms came not from researchers but from other climate communicators. \u201cThrough combo of exaggeration and hopelessness, [the NYMag piece] turns away those in the middle we need to persuade. It makes action harder,\u201d  tweeted Ramez Naam, a technologist and novelist . \u201cWe\u2019ve made huge climate strides. Business-as-usual used to mean six or seven degrees Celsius or warming. Now it looks like three to four, and [it\u2019s] trending down.\u201d Chuck Wendig, another novelist, called the story irresponsible. \u201cIt leans very hard on the EXTINCTION PORN angle, and almost not at all on the BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO angle,\u201d he said on Twitter. I\u2019m not so sure about this last angle. I have been writing about climate change nearly full-time for several years now. I don\u2019t think journalists should frame the truth to better inspire people\u2014that\u2019s not our job. But I vacillate considerably on the doom versus no-doom question. Consider what Wallace-Wells writes about climate change and war: Researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, social conflict could more than double this century. That final sentence is simplistic; we cannot wield careful social science conclusions like an abacus. It is also too certain: While Burke and Hsiang have found links between conflict and climate change, another group of researchers from Oslo have found far weaker connections. They observe a link between natural disaster and war only when a country is divided by ethnicity . Yet this is worrisome by itself. Consider the world that climate scientists say is more realistic: a place where sea levels cause mass migration within and without the developed world; where the economy is never great but isn\u2019t in shambles either; where voters fear for their livelihoods and superpowers poke at each others\u2019 weaknesses. Does that world sound like a safe and secure place to live? Does it sound like a workable status quo? And how many small wars need to start in that world before they all fuse together? Who needs planet-killing methane burps when nine different countries have 15,000 nuclear weapons between them? In short, there are plenty of doomsday scenarios to worry about. They don\u2019t need to be catastrophic on their face to induce catastrophe.","headline":"Are We as Doomed as That New York Magazine Article Says?","article_name":533112.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/07\/is-the-earth-really-that-doomed\/533112\/","date_published":"2017-07-10 22:06:23","article_length":9925,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:05.405024","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/07\/is-the-earth-really-that-doomed\/533112\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Fed up with slow (or in some cases,\u00a0 backwards ) progress on climate change, environmental advocates are mulling desperate measures. Emerging at the head of this pack is arguably the world\u2019s most prominent climate scientist: James Hansen, a former NASA researcher turned activist. So it\u2019s come to this. Last year, a researcher presented a paper on climate change at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s meeting entitled \u201dIs Earth F**ked?\u201d which advocated \u201cenvironmental direct action, resistance taken from outside the dominant culture, as in protests, blockades and sabotage by indigenous peoples, workers, anarchists and other activist groups.\u201d Last month, the Philippines climate commissioner and self-styled revolutionary Naderev \u201cYeb\u201d Sa\u00f1o held a 13-day fast in the midst of an international climate summit, just hours after Typhoon Haiyan ravaged his home country. In a tearful speech quoting Gandhi, he said : \u201cWe cannot sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate. It is now time to take action. We need an emergency climate pathway.\u201d And only last week, a conference of climate scientists in London explored the theme of \u201cradical emissions reduction\u201d after noting that \u201cnothing that we\u2019ve said or done to date about climate change has made any detectable dip whatsoever\u201d. Via a weblink, author Naomi Klein compared the fight against climate change with the struggle against South African apartheid, and said, \u201can agenda capable of delivering radical emissions reductions will only advance if accompanied by a radical movement.\u201d Fed up with slow (or in some cases, backwards ) progress on climate change, environmental advocates are mulling desperate measures. Emerging at the head of this pack is arguably the world\u2019s most prominent climate scientist: James Hansen, a former NASA researcher turned activist. In a provocative study published earlier this month, Hansen and a group of colleagues make the case for why radical action is needed. T he now commonly embraced international target of keeping global warming at a maximum of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels \u2014a hard-won, but politically negotiated goal\u2014is actually much too high, Hansen says, and we should instead aim for 1\u00b0C. That would be barely a blip higher than current levels of global warming (around 0.8\u00b0C), but still the highest level ever experienced over the 10,000-year course of human civilization . \u201dOur objective is to define what the science indicates is needed, not to assess political feasibility,\u201d the paper says. Hansen\u2019s main point is simple: If the Earth hasn\u2019t experienced temperatures warmer than 1\u00b0C as a result of natural climate variability for at least the last 100,000 years, that\u2019s probably about where we should draw our human-caused global warming line-in-the-sand. Beyond that point, things start to unravel pretty quickly. Environmentalists have dubbed this acceleration of warming \u201c the wheelchair curve \u201c: As warming approaches 2\u00b0C, it locks in an additional 10-20 meters of sea level rise over the next few hundred years\u2014enough to flood every coastal city in the world. Ecosystem collapse would be virtually assured, as plants and animals that have evolved into precise niches over hundreds of thousands of years are forced to adapt to new conditions in just a decade or two. Even assuming we eventually stop emitting CO2 completely, reaching 2\u00b0C could, the study shows, mean we remain above 1\u00b0C for hundreds of years or more. And if warming goes over 2\u00b0C, Hansen and his colleagues present a familiar litany of climate impacts: mass extinctions, stronger storms, and increasingly severe effects for human health, along with \u201cmajor dislocations for civilization.\u201d The study\u2019s key takeaway is that unless CO2 emissions peak right about now\u2014which they are clearly not doing\u2014in just a few more years we will lock in a 2\u00b0C rather than a 1\u00b0C temperature rise. That will set climate impacts in motion for the next thousand years or so, barring advances in technology that are currently largely discredited as either too expensive or too impractical on the scale necessary to reverse the warming that\u2019s already baked into the system. As we reported recently, the UN has endorsed a carbon \u201cbudget\u201d \u2014a maximum of one trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into the atmosphere to keep warming below 2\u00b0C. To stay below 1\u00b0C, Hansen et al argue that the world can burn only half this amount. To achieve this, they say, global CO2 emissions would need to peak immediately and decline three times faster than the rate currently being discussed for inclusion into the next global climate treaty\u2014a 90% reduction by 2030. The current UN plan (dotted line in the chart on the left below) won\u2019t even be implemented until 2020 at the earliest. Even if by some miracle Hansen\u2019s plan (the solid line in the chart on the left) took effect this week, he says we\u2019d still have only a 50\/50 shot at staying under 1\u00b0C. Basically, if we wait even a few years to implement anything less than a fossil-fuel starvation diet, momentum already built into the system nearly guarantees the climate is toast. To quote the study: The inertia of energy system infrastructure, (i.e., the time required to replace fossil fuel energy systems) will make it exceedingly difficult to avoid a level of CO2 that would have highly undesirable consequences. Hansen and his associates admonish the environmental community for doing the same things over and over again\u2014advocating for renewable energy, recycling, and hybrid cars\u2014and expecting different results. The change that is produced in this way is much, much too slow, they say. Their study concludes with what can only be characterized as a call to arms: a global challenge akin to the anti-slavery and civil rights movements, begging the world\u2019s young people to disrupt their governments and demand immediate action on climate change. In short, we\u2019re talkin\u2019 \u2019bout a revolution\u2014or in the words of the paper, \u201ca human \u2018tipping point\u2019.\u201d Are there no other options? Hansen and his co-authors argue there is a sliver of hope the world could stay near a 1\u00b0C goal if there were a bilateral agreement between the US and China\u2014the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters. Such a deal would need to immediately implement a gradually escalating carbon tax, rebate the revenue to its citizens equally per person, and place trade duties on any other country not willing to join in. That could quickly shift the world to a low-carbon economy, perhaps with enough cushion to prevent the most dangerous aspects of climate change. However, the authors dismiss this possibility as extremely unlikely. Another possible silver bullet, trusting technology to zap climate change via geoengineering (like sucking carbon dioxide directly from the air) is also a non-starter. Hansen et al calculate that the cost of immediately implementing free-air carbon capture, an unproven technology at large scale , would be around $50 trillion, though they admit that cost could come down a bit with future advances. In Hansen\u2019s view, young people have the best reason to fight the system . He has said he quit his job at NASA so he could more fully embrace climate activism, including a plan to sue the government on behalf of younger generations for failing to act on climate change in time. (At least in the United States, trying to sue corporations would probably fail ). He explained his strategy of helping youth fight climate change through the court system in a recent op-ed for CNN . And indeed, the US military already seems to be preparing for climate-induced mass protests, the Guardian reported in June, based on documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. But as with all revolutions, the fight for the climate will need a catalyst. It\u2019s unclear what that might be, especially when the very consumption culture that forms the bedrock of the present-day economic system is so ubiquitous\u2014and also at the root of the climate problem itself. Young people growing up now contemplating their futures may have the biggest reason for alarm, but with a problem like climate change that feels complex, distant and abstract, it may be hard to make the urgency that Hansen expresses resonate broadly. And even if a \u201chuman tipping point\u201d comes\u2014an Arab Spring for the climate\u2014will it sustain its momentum or, like most of the recent uprisings, burn out or collapse into factional bickering?","headline":"The Only Way to Stop Climate Change Now May Be Revolution","article_name":356367.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/12\/only-way-stop-climate-change-now-may-be-revolution\/356367\/","date_published":"2013-12-20 13:48:34","article_length":8390,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:06.443696","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/12\/only-way-stop-climate-change-now-may-be-revolution\/356367\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Big nations and private-sector titans arrived in Paris vowing to open their wallets for green energy technology. But can the U.S. make good on its promise? Even a transatlantic flight can\u2019t completely untether President Obama from congressional Republicans when it comes to cementing his legacy on climate change. When high-stakes United Nations talks on a new global climate pact open Monday in Paris, Obama and more than\u00a0a dozen other world leaders will pledge a huge boost in research-and-development funding for low-carbon energy technologies. Twenty nations will unveil \u201cMission Innovation,\u201d a joint plan to double their annual\u00a0R&D\u00a0investments over the next five years. According to a top White House climate policy adviser, the countries currently invest a total of about $10 billion annually, about half of which comes from the U.S. But the U.S. government's energy R&D spending has been largely stagnant in recent years , and the U.S. portion of the pledge is reliant on convincing Congress to open its wallet in the name of battling climate change, a threat that many Republicans downplay or even don\u2019t acknowledge. Relying on the good graces of Congress to make progress on climate change is something that Obama has generally sought to avoid for several years. Since Congress approved the big stimulus law that funded a suite of energy efforts in 2009\u2014and subsequently killed cap-and-trade legislation in 2010\u2014nearly all of Obama\u2019s climate agenda has rested on executive actions, ranging from much tougher auto-mileage rules to sweeping carbon-emissions limits for power plants that were finalized last summer. And U.S. officials are pushing for the Paris accord to be crafted in a way that won\u2019t need Senate sign-off the way that formal new treaties do, largely because there\u2019s almost no chance of winning the two-thirds vote that would be needed. But a big part of the Paris talks will be\u00a0about mobilizing the public-sector and private-sector cash needed to develop and deploy green energy technology more widely worldwide. That takes government money, and in the U.S., that means it takes Congress. And already, Republicans are resisting a White House request for a separate pot of money: the $3 billion that the U.S. pledged last year to the Green Climate Fund, a multilateral program to help poor nations cut emissions and become more resilient to rising sea levels and other unavoidable climatic changes. The White House has a pending request for a $500 million tranche of that money. Still, getting Congress to help with the new and separate R&D initiative, even if Capitol Hill remains controlled by the GOP, may not be pie in the sky. Republicans are generally more friendly to basic research than to regulations or to direct support for clean-tech companies through loans and tax subsidies. Consider that the Energy Department branch for funding so-called high-risk, high-reward energy-tech research, called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E), has had bipartisan support for years. And while Jeb Bush\u2019s energy plan is a set of familiar anti-regulatory talking points, near the end he notes: \u201c[W]e can further accelerate the discovery of game-changing technologies by boosting funding for high-priority basic research and increasing the effectiveness of our national labs.\u201d Top Obama administration officials argued Sunday that the R&D funding plan has appeal on both sides of the aisle. \u201cThe innovation agenda in general is one that actually does attract bipartisan support,\u201d Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told reporters on a conference call Sunday. \u201cI certainly have spoken with many members on both sides of the aisle, quite frankly, just in the last few days, and the innovation agenda is one that attracts broad support,\u201d Moniz said White House climate adviser Brian\u00a0Deese said the Mission Innovation effort is the fruit of an \u201cintense diplomatic effort\u201d in recent weeks. The 19 other nations involved include China and India, which respectively are the world\u2019s largest\u00a0and third-largest greenhouse gas polluters (the U.S. is second). Others include Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Indonesia, Denmark, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. \u201cThis is an effort designed to accelerate clean-energy innovation, address global climate change, provide affordable clean energy to consumers with a special focus on the developing world, and creating commercial opportunities for clean energy in developing countries,\u201d said Deese, who briefed reporters Sunday. The multilateral Mission Innovation effort is one half of a public-private announcement as the Paris climate summit opens. The other half is the launch of an initiative led by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates called the Breakthrough Energy Coalition that officials hope will complement the stepped-up R&D. It\u2019s an effort by high-profile private investors and corporate executives to greatly increase assistance for companies seeking to bring promising new energy technologies from the lab into real-world deployment, a gap often called the \u201cValley of Death\u201d because it\u2019s where many companies fail. The group includes Gates, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, billionaire activists George Soros and Tom Steyer, and 23 others from multiple countries. It\u2019s designed to work in tandem with the government R&D funding boost. Here\u2019s part of the lengthy joint statement that the investors released Sunday evening: \u201cExperience indicates that even the most promising ideas face daunting commercialization challenges and a nearly impassable Valley of Death between promising concept and viable product, which neither government funding nor conventional private investment can bridge. This collective failure can be addressed, in part, by a dramatically scaled-up public research pipeline, linked to a different kind of private investor with a long-term commitment to new technologies who is willing to put truly patient flexible risk capital to work.\u201d There\u2019s a reason for all the focus on R&D and getting the fruit of lab work into the global energy market. International negotiations are aimed at trying to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, which scientists say would help avoid some of the most dangerous effects of climate change. But experts say that the carbon-cutting pledges called \u201cIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\u201d that nations have submitted to the United Nations, which last through 2025 or 2030, won\u2019t tame global emissions enough to stay under that target. So work to bring emerging technologies and steeper cost reductions into the market\u2014and relatively quickly\u2014is needed. \u201cFor all of the progress that has [been] made, those INDCs alone are not sufficient,\u201d Deese told reporters. \u201cWe know that we are going to need to do more to mobilize financial support for low-carbon development in the countries that need it.\u201d","headline":"One Big Way Obama Can't Outrun Congress on Climate Change","article_name":447813.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/one-big-way-obama-cant-outrun-congress-on-climate-change\/447813\/","date_published":"2015-11-30 00:00:00","article_length":6905,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:06.867225","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/one-big-way-obama-cant-outrun-congress-on-climate-change\/447813\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The group, whose states represent half of U.S. GDP, pledged $1.4 billion to support electric cars, plus a new set of policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. In his 20 months in office, President Donald Trump has stripped out huge swaths of federal climate policy. He has canceled or incapacitated Barack Obama\u2013era programs meant to encourage a cleaner electricity system  and more efficient cars , and he has left the Paris Agreement on climate change . Now climate-concerned governors are doing what they can to fight back. On Thursday, a bipartisan alliance of 17 governors announced a new set of policies aimed at combatting climate change and working around Trump-led rollbacks. They have promised to better manage natural land; to blunt the effect of solar-panel import tariffs; and to restrict the release of \u201cshort-lived climate pollutants,\u201d gases like methane that can trap enormous amounts of heat in the atmosphere. The governors also pledged to spend $1.4 billion to build new infrastructure for electric cars and to support their purchase, deploying funds that were won in the class-action settlement with Volkswagen . The victims of climate change are already here. Not all of their plans are accompanied by such hefty funding. But the slate of new policies, taken together, represents one of the broadest set of actions yet taken to keep carbon emissions falling in the face of the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks. The announcement was all the more notable for being made with the governments of Mexico and Canada, which agreed to implement their own version of some of the state-level policies. \u201cThis is a statement of confidence that we can lick this problem,\u201d Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington and a Democrat, told me. \u201cWe have to fight the despair that some people feel because of the Trump administration\u2019s climate denial and lack of planning. We have to defeat that.\u201d \u201cIf man is going to destroy our fellow man, it\u2019s either going to be by nuclear proliferation or because we ignore the simple reality that our environment is getting warmer, it\u2019s going to overwhelm us, and we are approaching a tipping point,\u201d said Dannel Malloy, the Democratic governor of Connecticut, at the Thursday event. \u201cWe simply need to do everything in our individual power and as states together to hold that back.\u201d The governors are acting as members of the U.S. Climate Alliance , a coalition of states that have promised to abide by the Paris Agreement on climate change. The alliance is made up of 14 Democratic governors, including Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 of Puerto Rico, and three popular Republican governors from traditionally blue states: Larry Hogan of Maryland, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, and Phil Scott of Vermont. They issued the new policies at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, a conference of countries, companies, and local governments that have committed to fighting climate change. Part pep rally, part technology exhibition, the summit is meant to inspire flagging environmental hopes while celebrating the legacy of Jerry Brown, California\u2019s outgoing Democratic governor, who has helped turn the state into a climate-policy powerhouse . The summit is also global recognition that state and city governments are, for now, the sole hope for aggressive American climate policy. The U.S. Climate Alliance is the star of that show: It is by far the largest coalition to emerge since Trump took office. Taken together, the 16 states in the alliance represent 40 percent of the U.S. population and roughly half of its GDP. But the alliance also represents the pitfalls of a subnational approach. Despite essentially forming the world\u2019s third-largest economy, the 16 Climate Alliance states represent only a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions, according to 2015 data from the Energy Information Administration . So it remains an open question how successfully states and cities can fight climate change, especially if the federal government pushes the other way. A recent Yale report found that the current slate of state and local policies would only get the United States half of the way to meeting its 2030 carbon-cutting promises under the Paris Agreement. The Thursday announcement encompassed five policies, several of which have been described before. Some of them are targeted directly at Trump\u2019s actions. Earlier this week, for instance, the Trump administration began rolling back Environmental Protection Agency rules restricting methane emissions . Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas: A single molecule of methane can trap roughly 25 times as much heat as a molecule of carbon dioxide, even though the methane leaves the atmosphere faster. As part of the Climate Alliance announcement, the 16 states resolved to reduce their emission of methane and other short-lived super-pollutants by 40 percent by 2030. The governments of Mexico and Canada joined them in making this pledge. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable to have the governments of Mexico and Canada issuing a statement with 17 U.S. governors, as opposed to the federal government,\u201d says Dan Lashof , the director of the World Resources Institute in the United States. \u201cThat is not normal\u2014and in this particular instance, it\u2019s a very positive thing.\u201d Also in opposition to Trump, the states promised to implement a suite of utility policies that will reduce the costs of new solar-panel installation. After Trump imposed an import tariff on solar panels earlier this year, U.S. companies froze or canceled $2.5 billion in new large-scale solar projects. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tertiary or supply-chain ways we think states can continue to drive down the [solar] costs,\u201d Inslee told me. The states also pledged to adopt the same strict energy-efficiency guidelines for household appliances, which it says will save consumers $4 billion by 2025. Trump\u2019s Energy Department has sometimes neglected or tried to close similar federal programs, such as Energy Star. But some state programs seem to have little to do with the president. For instance, the governors pledged to better track how carbon dioxide is stored in ecosystems and soil. Forests in the United States absorb more carbon than they emit, offsetting 11 percent of the country\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions . But neither states nor the federal government have ever focused on better managing that bounty, Lashof told me. Land use \u201cis an area where we just aren\u2019t doing a good enough job of tracking what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. David Ige, the Democratic governor of Hawaii, told me that the new land-use strategy was the most important policy to his state. He said that he looked forward to his state\u2019s land managers sharing their expertise and learning from those in other states. \u201cIn Hawaii, our people are connected to the land. And better managing nature and our working lands is just fundamentally a part of our culture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to know what other states are doing, and we want to understand how to do it better.\u201d \u201cA lot of these things\u2014if you\u2019re not a climate-policy wonk, then they seem really unsexy,\u201d says Julie Cerqueira, the director of the U.S. Climate Alliance. \u201cBut if you have a handful of states that adopt the same energy-efficiency standards, you\u2019re pushing the entire market in that direction, even if 30 other states don\u2019t have these rules.\u201d Cape Town is an omen. \u201cThese are important actions to rein in emissions and many explicitly respond to our Trumpian woes,\u201d said Julian NoiseCat , a policy analyst at the climate-activist group 350.org, in an email. \u201cThe most significant announcement, in my view, is the $1.4 billion from the VW settlement. We need as much investment in transforming our energy and transportation sector as we can get.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important, though I admit discouraging, to point out that $1.4 billion is a great commitment, but we need much more. The Second Avenue Subway in New York City, for reference, cost $17 billion,\u201d he added, referencing a famously expensive transit project . \u201cThese are technical policies, but this is where the rubber meets the road. It\u2019s a lot of real-life, meat-and-potatoes action, and it\u2019s not just pronouncements of intent,\u201d Governor Inslee said. \u201cTrump can\u2019t stop us in the state.

{"id":null,"body":"Advocates of action on climate change hold a trump card. When the Supreme Court in 2007\u00a0determined that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, the EPA got a mandate to regulate it. But, what the court giveth, the court can rescind in a tightly contested vote. Advocates of forceful action on climate change have long held a trump card. The primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. is coal plants, and \u2014\u00a0since the Supreme Court has determined that those emissions are a pollutant \u2014\u00a0the EPA is mandated to regulate them. At some point, then, whether whatever president likes it or not, the agency had to make a rule limiting carbon dioxide\u00a0emissions. But, what the court giveth, the court can rescind in a tightly contested vote. And with a barrage of petitions raining down on a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, it's possible that the EPA's pollution-control mandate could be eradicated well before the threat of climate change is. Among large, developed countries, only Australia emits more carbon dioxide per person than the United States. China emits the most overall, of course, but as greenhouse gas polluters, we're still in the top tier. For decades, environmentalists have pushed to cut the country's overall emissions levels, winning a significant victory in 2007 when the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts vs. EPA that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant. Under the Clean Air Act, that required that the EPA take action. So far, it hasn't. When Barack Obama came into office, pledging to be the president who oversaw the moment when \"the rise of the oceans began to slow,\" \u00a0advocates hoped he'd move quickly to curb\u00a0carbon dioxide\u00a0emissions. In 2009, the House passed a measure to institute a market-based system to reduce emissions; it wasn't voted on in the Senate. Last January, Obama called for a similar solution, saying he'd act if the Congress wouldn't. That declaration, however belated, was interpreted as meaning he would ask the EPA to regulate coal-burning plants, even though his staff seemed unprepared to do so . While Obama and the EPA have delayed, opponents of regulating greenhouse gas emissions \u2014\u00a0largely fossil fuel companies \u2014\u00a0have filed a number of challenges to the Court's ruling. To date, they've failed; in both July and December last year, lower courts upheld the EPA's right to regulate. But each lower court decision makes an appeal to the highest court more inevitable. Reuters indicates that a case could arrive at the Supreme Court as soon as this October. That last point is even more alarming. The EPA uses the Clean Air Act as its mandate to regulate air pollution. If the Court says that it can't use the law to regulate carbon dioxide, it will not take long for companies that emit pollution of various types to challenge other Clean Air Act regulations. There were two dissenting opinions filed in the five-to-four Massachusetts vs. EPA , written by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia. The make-up of the Court hasn't changed much; there are two new justices \u2014\u00a0Sotomayor and Kagan \u2014\u00a0who replace two that voted to support the majority opinion. In other words, it's not clear that the Court hearing the case means that the EPA's ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions will be revoked. But it's another sign of the lack of progress made in addressing climate change over the last six years. In 2007, a five-to-four vote established a critical tool that the EPA could use to tackle global warming. In 2013 \u2014 without that having happened and facing a much weaker political position \u2014 environmental advocates can only hope to keep that trump card in the deck.","headline":"The EPA Could Lose Its Power to Fight Climate Change Before Using It","article_name":315074.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/05\/epa-could-lose-its-power-fight-climate-change-using-it\/315074\/","date_published":"2013-05-17 19:39:05","article_length":3638,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:08.141741","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2013\/05\/epa-could-lose-its-power-fight-climate-change-using-it\/315074\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The former vice president discusses how the politics of the environment have changed considerably over his decades of advocacy. Al Gore is mostly done with politics these days. Though he popped up at a campaign stop with Hillary Clinton in 2016, he\u2019s otherwise safely in the very small group of nationally known Democrats not thinking of running for president in 2020. But Gore remains engaged on his signature policy issue: climate change, for which the national political conversation is just starting to catch up to his warnings from decades ago. While he was a senator, through his eight years as vice president, and during his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore was tagged on the campaign trail as a global-warning alarmist obsessed with data and far-off predictions. Now, between the growing support for the Green New Deal in Congress and the presidential candidates railing against climate change, the Democratic Party has made aggressive action central to its developing identity. The former vice president, who\u2019s won an Oscar for his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth and a Nobel Peace Prize for his environmental advocacy, speaks often at United Nations and other international meetings on climate change, events that some American officials and other prominent figures continue to attend despite President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop sending official representatives on behalf of his administration. What Gore hasn\u2019t done much of, though, is talk directly about American politics and political candidates, including the dynamics within the party that nominated him for president 18 years ago. Gore and I spoke recently for a story about Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, who is readying a presidential campaign that will make climate change and America\u2019s response to it the central issue and cause. (Gore says he isn\u2019t making an endorsement, or at least not yet.) We talked about why he thinks the national conversation on climate has changed and what he thinks hasn\u2019t changed quickly enough. Here\u2019s more of our interview, which has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. Isaac Dovere: Where do you see the politics of climate change right now? Al Gore: I think that we are extremely close to a political tipping point. We may actually be crossing it right about now. The much-vaunted tribalism in American politics has contributed to an odd anomaly, in that the core of one of our political parties is uniquely\u2014in all of the world\u2014still rejecting not just the science, but also the messages from Mother Nature that have pushed toward, and perhaps are pushing across, this political tipping point right now. More and more people on the conservative side of the spectrum are really changing their positions now. This election, in 2020, is almost certainly going to be different from any previous presidential election in that a number of candidates will be placing climate at or near the top of their agenda. And I think that by the time the first primary and caucus votes are cast a year from now, you\u2019re going to see a very different political dialogue in the U.S. The climate-related extreme-weather events are causing millions of people who had successfully pushed this issue into the background and into the projected distant future to now be finding ways to talk about it and to express their deep concern. Dovere: When you were in politics and talking about climate change, you were made fun of for it. Is that weird to think about now? Gore: Forty years ago, it was not easy to get people\u2019s sustained attention for this looming crisis. It\u2019s much easier now. Dovere: What do you make of the Democratic presidential contenders talking about climate change now? Gore: Leaders who advocate solutions to the climate crisis should all run. There are several who have indicated they want to make this the No. 1 issue, who are in the midst of deciding whether to run or not. And I think it\u2019s good for the country and good for the world to have this issue elevated into the top tier during this upcoming campaign. Dovere: Every time there\u2019s a new report on climate change, activists say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get going before it\u2019s too late.\u201d And every time there\u2019s a new report, climate-change deniers say, \u201cWell, you said the world was ending the last time.\u201d Do you think there\u2019s actually a point when it will be too late? Gore: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously said, \u201cThere is such a thing as too late.\u201d [ Editor\u2019s Note : King\u2019s words are often remembered this way, but the actual quote is,\u201cWe are faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words Too Late .\u201d] And indeed there is. But where the climate crisis is concerned, we have actually already done some significant damage, some of which, regrettably, is not recoverable. Many people are hesitant to acknowledge that, because it creates a risk of despair. I know that from my long political involvement in this issue. In my first movie, I made this statement: \u201cThere are people who go straight from denial to despair without pausing on the intermediate step, to actually solving the crisis.\u201d That is the case. But let me be clear: Even though some low-lying coastal communities are already going to face devastating sea-level rise no matter what we do, it is also undeniably true that we still have the ability to prevent the absolutely catastrophic results that would pose an existential threat to human civilization\u2019s survival. And we must act, even while acknowledging that some damage has already been done. Dovere: Where is it too late? Gore: We heard the discouraging news a couple of years ago that a major component of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has now crossed a negative tipping point, and will almost certainly collapse no matter what we do. So for those who were hoping that we could have a comprehensive global response in time to prevent any of these damages, that was an emotional blow. But the scientists who have deep expertise on that part of the issue tell us quickly, \u201cOkay, wait. We still have the ability to affect the rate of that collapse, and more importantly, we still have the ability almost certainly to forestall the collapse of the other large ice sheets, behind that one. And we still have the ability to prevent the collapse of ice sheets in East Antarctica that could take the sea-level rise unimaginably higher.\u201d So how do we respond emotionally and, then, politically? We just have to be clear-eyed about it\u2014and we have to be brave about it\u2014in acknowledging that for some of these consequences, it\u2019s already too late, but for the most serious of them, it is not too late.","headline":"Al Gore: America Is Close to a \u2018Political Tipping Point\u2019 on Climate Change","article_name":579340.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2019\/01\/al-gore-q-climate-change-and-2020-democrats\/579340\/","date_published":"2019-01-03 14:16:09","article_length":6736,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:09.010208","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2019\/01\/al-gore-q-climate-change-and-2020-democrats\/579340\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cI also know that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way,\u201d Jim Bridenstine said, taking an unusual stance for his administration. The new administrator of NASA held a town hall Thursday at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C. Jim Bridenstine is about four weeks into the job , and his path here was mired in controversy. After a few opening remarks, he started taking some questions. The first was about what Bridenstine thinks makes him qualified to be the head of NASA . The second was, as the moderator put it, \u201cone more easy one\u2014because it\u2019s about climate change.\u201d Bridenstine laughed. So did many in the room. It was an uncomfortable question. Bridenstine, as a Republican in Congress, has a record of denying that humans are responsible for causing climate change. For Democrats and liberals, Bridenstine\u2019s view on this and other issues\u2014particularly on same-sex marriage and transgender rights \u2014made him a contentious pick to lead NASA , an agency that supports climate-change research and very publicly agrees with the majority of climate scientists who say that humans are the primary cause of the planet\u2019s rising temperatures. \u201cAs far as my position on climate change and how it\u2019s evolved, I\u2019ll be very open,\u201d Bridenstine replied. He described, as he has done multiple times before , his longstanding interest in funding weather-forecasting programs, particularly for tornadoes, which threaten people in Oklahoma, Bridenstine\u2019s home state, each year. Then he got to what his critics wanted to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t deny that consensus that the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I fully believe and know that the climate is changing. I also know that we humans beings are contributing to it in a major way. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. We\u2019re putting it into the atmosphere in volumes that we haven\u2019t seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet. That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it.\u201d Bridenstine did not say that humans are the main drivers of climate change. But his assertion that people are contributing to climate change \u201cin a major way\u201d marks his strongest support to date for the scientific consensus behind warming temperatures. And he went further than perhaps any other Trump-picked leader has. Bridenstine went further on Thursday than he has in the past\u2014even in the very recent past, like at his Senate confirmation hearing in November, which was convened a month after President Trump picked Bridenstine as his choice to lead NASA . When Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, questioned Bridenstine about his views on climate change, Bridenstine said, \u201cI believe carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. I believe that humans are contributing to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\u201d \u201cTo what extent?\u201d Schatz asked. \u201cThat is a question I do not have an answer to, but I do know that humans have absolutely contributed to global warming,\u201d Bridenstine replied. \u201cAre they the primary cause?\u201d Schatz said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to depend on a whole lot of factors, and we\u2019re still learning more about that every day,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIn some years, you could say absolutely. In other years, during sun cycles and other things, there are other contributing factors that would have more of an impact.\u201d Bridenstine said something similar in June 2013, six months after he took office in the House of Representatives, and soon after a tornado killed 24 people in Oklahoma. During a floor speech , Bridenstine asked former President Barack Obama to apologize to Oklahomans for spending more money on global-warming research than on weather forecasting and warnings (a claim that PolitiFact, a fact-checking website run by reporters, rated as \u201c mostly false .\u201d) \u201cGlobal temperature changes, when they exist, correlate with sun output and ocean cycles,\u201d Bridenstine said back then. \u201cDuring the Medieval Warm Period from 800 to 1300 A.D. , long before cars, power plants, and the industrial revolution, temperatures were warmer than today. During the Little Ice Age from 1300 to 1900 A.D. , temperatures were cooler. Neither of these were caused by any human activity.\u201d (Scientists have found that volcanic eruptions also play a large role in these natural changes in climate, and they note that recent temperature changes dwarf any of these historic anomalies.) Bridenstine\u2019s appearance at Thursday\u2019s town hall signaled a shift in the way he talks about climate change\u2014and it was fairly reassuring for some on the other side. \u201cThis goes to show Jim is a realist and pragmatist on climate\u2014much as we had hoped when we looked to the confirmation hearing to hear the right answers. The answer he gave today is the right answer,\u201d says Phil Larson, a former adviser in the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy under Obama and the assistant dean of the University of Colorado at Boulder\u2019s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. \u201cBut what\u2019s even more important than right answers is how does that translate to NASA\u2019 s earth-science portfolio?\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s possible that Bridenstine was trying to make sure his employees don\u2019t hate him. It\u2019s also possible Bridenstine is trying to convey, ever so slightly\u2014and ever so unlikely, as his most vocal critics would probably say\u2014that he\u2019s changing his mind. As far as my position on climate change and how it\u2019s evolved , he had said. \u201cEvolve\u201d is a favorite word for politicians seeking to change their public opinions about something without incurring the wrath of flip-flopping accusations. In 2008, Obama said he didn\u2019t support marriage for same-sex couples. In 2010, he shifted, saying \u201cAttitudes evolve, including mine.\u201d A memoir from David Axelrod, an Obama adviser, revealed in 2015 what many had already suspected: The former president only made that statement in 2008 because it was politically expedient . When Bridenstine was in Congress, it was probably politically expedient to rail against human-caused climate change. Perhaps he knows that now, at NASA , it\u2019s not. Still, whether Bridenstine\u2019s views on climate change have changed or not, the views of his bosses haven\u2019t, and this remains a point of concern for Bridentine\u2019s critics. The Trump White House has proposed cutting or canceling many of NASA \u2019s earth-science missions. So far, they\u2019ve been spared. Republicans don\u2019t have enough seats in the Senate to pass their dream budgets, so they\u2019ve had to negotiate bipartisan budget legislation with Democrats. This setup has preserved most of NASA \u2019s climate funding, but not all. The latest budget deal didn\u2019t specifically mention  NASA \u2019s Carbon Monitoring System, a $10-million program to track greenhouse-gas emissions around the world. The Trump administration took that as an opportunity to terminate the program for good. Bridenstine became NASA chief 15 months after Obama\u2019s pick stepped down, an unprecedented gap in the transition between two administrations. How does the White House feel that less than a month in, he\u2019s making one of the most supportive statements for climate change of any Trump-nominated leaders? \u201cThe climate has changed and is always changing,\u201d said Raj Shah, the principal deputy press secretary. \u201cTo address climate change as well as other risks, the U.S. will continue to promote access to affordable and reliable energy and support technology, innovation and the development of modern and efficient infrastructure in order to reduce emissions and effectively address future climate-related risks.\u201d Robinson Meyer contributed reporting to this article.","headline":"Trump\u2019s NASA Chief: 'I Fully Believe and Know the Climate Is Changing'","article_name":560642.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/trump-nasa-climate-change-bridenstine\/560642\/","date_published":"2018-05-17 19:36:00","article_length":7530,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:09.739935","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/trump-nasa-climate-change-bridenstine\/560642\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new study aims to answer: When do we know if bad weather can be blamed on global warming? This past winter was an exceptionally strange one across North America. Rain deluged California, as unseasonable warmth fanned across the Midwest and Eastern seaboard. In New York, sales of salt and snow shovels plunged ; in Washington, some of the famous cherry trees bloomed too early and died . When the weather gets weird, many people now think of climate change. And nearly as many people know, too, that it\u2019s hopeless to try to figure out if it\u2019s to blame. For decades, journalists have repeated that weather and climate are different\u2014weather deals in specifics and climate in probabilities\u2014and so no individual weather event can be attributed to climate change. They may have to stop repeating that line soon. Less than a week after the heat wave ended, the non-profit Climate Central announced in the pages of The New York Times that anthropogenic global warming was likely to blame for the early warmth. A February warm patch is three times as likely in today\u2019s climate as it was in the climate of 1900, the organization\u2019s World Weather Attribution team found. The technique behind this finding is called rapid attribution, and it works by comparing observed meteorological data against data from climate models. A study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences attempts to offer a new standardized and conservative approach for tying individual weather events to human-caused global warming. In doing so, it also comes to some significant findings of its own. Chief among these: Across 97 percent of the observed area, the hottest day of the summer and the hottest month of the summer are becoming hotter due to human-caused climate change. In the tropics, global warming has made a new hottest-month temperature record four times more likely to happen than it would otherwise. It has also made the tropics twice as likely to experience the driest year on local record. \u201cIn most places, when you get a heat wave now, there is probably a human finger print,\u201d says Daniel Swain, an author of the paper and a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that this has been done at this large scale,\u201d says Heidi Cullen, the chief scientist at Climate Central and a leader on the World Weather Attribution project. She was not involved in the study. \u201cIt helps us understand at this 50,000-foot level the way that climate change is already having an impact on temperature and participation.\u201d \u201cThe public discourse didn\u2019t recognize that the scientific community has come up with these tools for individual events,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is to provide a first, best answer to the questions that the public is asking after an extreme event.\u201d Rapid attribution isn\u2019t yet close to perfect, and it remains harder to attribute an extreme event to climate change when the event is more complex, Swain told me. The recent California drought is a good example. (Swain writes the California Weather Blog in addition to his published research.) \u201cThe answer you get definitely depends on the question you ask,\u201d he told me. For example: If researchers compare the drought to longterm trends in precipitation, then the drought doesn\u2019t seem tied to human-caused climate change. But if they check the drought against precipitation trends and temperature extremes, then it suddenly seems so anomalous as to be warming-triggered. And if they also look at the high-pressure patterns that may have caused the drought in the first place, they get a third, more ambiguous answer about its relation to climate change. \u201cBut the absence of evidence isn\u2019t evidence of absence,\u201d Swain says. \u201cWhat we can now say for heat extremes is that that argument\u2014that there\u2019s an absence of evidence\u2014goes out the window. For other sorts of events, in other regions, there is still an absence of evidence.\u201d Beyond the actual attributional work that it does, the paper\u2019s more lasting contribution may be methodological: It proposes a multi-step process to attributing weather to climate change. First, scientists should identify whether there is an underlying trend in the historical weather data for a certain place. Then, they should determine how much that trend contributed to the \u201cextremeness\u201d of any one weather episode. Finally, they should compare that magnitude with two climate-model experiments: whether a changed climate, rich like ours in atmospheric carbon dioxide, would produce a similarly extreme trend; and whether a historically \u201cnormal\u201d climate , similar to one from 1850 or 1900, would. There are some limitations on the new paper\u2019s findings that don\u2019t apply to its methodology. It only used one model\u2014the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research\u2014to test whether certain trends were climate-driven. Swain says that they hope to bring more models into the process soon; Cullen says that her team uses an ensemble of models when attributing an event. Because the technique requires an excess of data, it only works in places where there is a decades-long temperature record. Therefore it focuses on well-populated and historically developed places\u2014North America, Europe, Asia, and the South American coasts\u2014and does not look at recent temperature trends over much of the oceans. For the most populated parts of the globe (and certainly for the continental United States), it\u2019s possible to imagine a world where estimates of climate-changedness become a part of the meteorological landscape. (Especially if machine-learning algorithms continue to improve at estimating the output of a climate model without requiring it to be fully run again.) On some warm February day of the future, maybe your phone\u2019s weather app will tell you not only how hot it will be\u2014but how much likelier such a record-breaking day is in a climate-changed world.","headline":"Climate Change Is Causing More Sweltering Summer Days","article_name":524253.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/hot-summers-climate-change\/524253\/","date_published":"2017-05-03 08:45:00","article_length":5920,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:10.496564","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/hot-summers-climate-change\/524253\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"While parts of the world have warmed or cooled in the past, modern climate change is happening just about everywhere at the same time. From the planet\u2019s perspective, one of the most significant events of the past 2,000 years occurred on April 5, 1815, when the Indonesian volcano Mount Tambora began to erupt. \u201cThe noise was, in the first instance, almost universally attributed to a distant cannon,\u201d wrote a British statesman stationed hundreds of miles away on Java. Soon \u201cthe sun became obscured\u201d with ash, and by the next week, fog-like smoke reduced visibility to 900 feet, while earthquakes shook the island. Tambora was the largest volcanic eruption since the end of the last Ice Age, one of a series of eruptions that pumped huge amounts of sunlight-reflecting gas into the atmosphere. This gas darkened and chilled summers in Europe. It weakened the monsoons in India and West Africa. It allowed glaciers to advance in the Alps. In other words, these eruptions brought about a kind of natural climate change. But it was felt differently in different places. And new research confirms that it pales in comparison to the climate change we now face. Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change Absolutely nothing resembling modern-day global warming has happened on Earth for at least the past 2,000 years, a new study published today in Nature confirms. Since the birth of Jesus Christ, the climate has sometimes naturally changed\u2014some parts of the world have briefly cooled, and some have briefly warmed\u2014but it has never changed as it\u2019s changing now. Never once until the Industrial Revolution did temperatures surge in the same direction everywhere at the same time. They\u2019re doing so now, the study finds. Drawing on a huge database of climate-recording objects from all over the world\u2014including tree rings , cave formations , and ancient pollen trapped in lake mud \u2014the study concludes that 98 percent of Earth\u2019s surface experienced its hottest period of the past 2,000 years within living memory. That uniform heat spike \u201cis unprecedented over the Common Era,\u201d it says. This latest finding may not surprise most climate scientists, who suspect that the planet is as hot now as it\u2019s ever been in at least the past 125,000 years . But it may shock some politicians, who have downplayed modern-day climate change by talking about those past shifts. \u201cThe climate has always been changing. There has never been a time when the climate has not changed,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio at a Republican presidential debate in 2016 . To which the study replies: Sure. It just hasn\u2019t changed like this. In fairness, that wasn\u2019t always clear. Decades ago, researchers talked about the past periods of climate change as global events. They cited the Little Ice Age, which began in roughly 1550 and ended around 1850, as an era when global temperatures fell everywhere. But this study\u2014and work from other scholars\u2014suggests that the Little Ice Age wasn\u2019t global at all, and mostly lowered temperatures in western Europe and parts of North America. \u201cTraditionally, the understanding of climate over [the past 2,000 years] is that there were globally coherent periods of climate variability\u2014that there was a cold period called the Little Ice Age, [or] that there was a warm period called the Medieval Climate Anomaly,\u201d said Nathan Steiger , an author of the paper and a research scientist at Columbia, at a press conference this week. \u201cWhat we show is that these periods weren\u2019t globally coherent, as previously thought.\u201d Read: Are we living through climate change\u2019s worst-case scenario? What makes those older eras different from modern warming is coherence\u2014 that climate change is happening today just about everywhere at the same time. \u201cThat coherence cannot be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,\u201d Steiger said. And it does not characterize any previous era. \u201cThis study is another nail in the coffin of the idea of that there was a globally warm or cold period that fit tidily into a specific couple of centuries,\u201d said Yarrow Axford , a climate scientist at Northwestern University, in an email. She was not involved in writing the new paper. The idea that the Little Ice Age or eras like it were uniform global events was \u201calready dying within the scientific community,\u201d she said, yet that idea remains \u201cperennially popular with nonexperts who want to sow doubt about the significance of the dramatic and truly global warming that has occurred in the past century.\u201d Among the nonexperts who have tacitly embraced that idea: Donald Trump. The president has repeatedly brought up the fluctuating nature of the climate in order to downplay current change. \u201cSomething\u2019s changing, and it\u2019ll change back again,\u201d he said on 60 Minutes last year .","headline":"No Climate Event in 2,000 Years Compares to What\u2019s Happening Now","article_name":594517.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/why-little-ice-age-doesnt-matter\/594517\/","date_published":"2019-07-24 17:00:00","article_length":4774,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:11.417833","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/07\/why-little-ice-age-doesnt-matter\/594517\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"You can\u2019t understand the history of American energy use without them. A new visual history puts them in context. Every Tuesday morning, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . The first thing you should know about the history of energy in the United States is that, about 150 years ago, the horses got absolutely ripped. \u201cIn the mid-19th century, you have a massive expansion of the horse body. They become 50 percent more powerful,\u201d Robert Suits, a historian at the University of Chicago, told me. This matters to the history of energy because, back then, horses were a primary form of transportation. (As Jason Torchinsky has written, horses were the world\u2019s first semiautonomous vehicle .) It matters because of how the change happened at all\u2014a massive program of selective breeding that was not possible, Suits said, until railroads existed to ferry promising horses over long distances. And it matters, finally, because you must understand how yoked horses are to figure out how much energy the U.S. economy used to use. In the 1810s, the average American horse ate 25,000 to 30,000 calories a day, Suits said. By 1900, each ate 35,000 to 40,000 calories a day. That translates to far more hay and oats. That tidbit is one of many things I learned from an astonishing new research project from Suits and his colleagues. It\u2019s a history of the American energy system in chart form, from 1800 to 2019. It was published today: This type of chart is called a Sankey diagram, which shows the relative size of flows in and out of a system. This particular Sankey diagram shows the inputs and outputs for the U.S. energy system, measured in watts per capita. The left side of the chart shows where energy is coming  from (coal, natural gas, or petroleum) and the right side shows what it\u2019s being used for (transportation, agriculture, or home lighting and heating). You can find a full interactive version of their chart online. Honestly, I\u2019ve featured this chart here in the hopes that you\u2019ll go to their website and play around with it. There is \u2026 a lot going on in it. As far as I\u2019m aware, this is the first attempt to put so much information about U.S. energy history in one place . \u201cYou could write a book from that Sankey alone,\u201d Apratim Sahay, an energy consultant based in Boston, told me. So click around ! Look at what\u2019s happening in the year you were born versus what\u2019s happening now. Look at what the energy system was like 100 years before you were born. It will help you think more keenly about climate change. In a broader sense, I\u2019m featuring this project because it has a lot to teach us about how the energy system got to be the way it is today\u2014and how it might change, and be made to change, in the future. First, you can glean the big eras in American energy use from this chart. The half century from 1800 to 1850 saw the country devour biomass, most of it in the form of firewood and animal feed. In the 1870s, biomass gave way to the first fossil fuels: coal and, to a lesser extent, petroleum. (Petroleum initially dominated as fuel for lamps, not transportation.) By the 1910s, coal was dominant. \u201cCoal was basically doing everything in the economy except electricity,\u201d Suits said. It heated homes, powered railroads, and helped forge steel. But it was dirty and frustrating to move, and its price was volatile. In the 1920s, it began to fade from the economy, replaced by natural gas, electricity, and\u2014in the transportation sector\u2014petroleum (in the form of gasoline). This was the age of cars and electrified Sun Belt suburbs\u2014and it lasted 50 years, until the energy crisis of the 1970s arrived and capped energy use. Since 1973, per capita energy use hasn\u2019t increased. In recent years, you can see natural gas driving out coal from the electricity sector. It was getting a handle on that change, actually, that led the project\u2019s leader to start working on it in the first place. \u201cThe changes that are happening in the electricity sector now\u2014changes that are as large as any energy transition we\u2019ve seen\u2014are difficult to grasp \u2026 without animating the data,\u201d Elisabeth Moyer , an atmospheric-chemistry professor at the University of Chicago who created the project, told me. (This is as good a moment as any to mention that I am a visiting journalism fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago this year. It is not a paid position, and I haven\u2019t been able to visit since 2019, because of the pandemic. But it\u2019s how I met Moyer.) However, this narration leaves out a lot of the surprises that make the chart wonderful. Take 1800, for instance. That thread of wind energy going to transportation? That\u2019s wind filling the sails of schooners. The hydro going to industry is from rivers spinning gristmills. And look at that chunk of biomass! That\u2019s mostly firewood. Another observation: Everything happens in energy history later than I expect. The first commercial coal mines operated in America in the 18th century, and the first oil well was drilled in 1859. But the amount of coal energy didn\u2019t exceed the amount of biomass energy until 1888. And because Americans used so much firewood to heat their homes, that\u2019s also about when the energy used in the economy exceeded the amount of energy used at home. The same is true with electricity. Electricity started to take off only after World War II, but not until 1959 did Americans consume more electricity than coal at home. By the same token, every battle in energy seems to have happened before. Look at coal\u2019s struggle in the 20th century\u2014at its peak in 1918, it powered every part of the economy except  agriculture. Then it declined so quickly that, by the 1960s, it seemed destined for eradication. If you had looked around then, you would\u2019ve assumed coal had only a few short years left, Moyer and her colleagues write. Instead, the oil crisis struck during the 1970s, and coal found a new niche. It became a fuel primarily used for generating electricity, in part because its domestic origin made it especially attractive and reliable-seeming to policy makers. Then it rallied again. It remained a core part of the energy mix until the 2010s, when it was priced out by natural gas: One more takeaway: It\u2019s really, really hard to decrease the amount of raw fuel used in the economy. Remember, this Sankey diagram is in per capita terms. But because the country\u2019s population is almost always growing, a decline in per capita use doesn\u2019t translate to a decline in absolute use. In fact, since 1800, the only type of energy source to decline in absolute terms is coal , represented as black in this chart: Look at that green sliver at the bottom of the chart. It\u2019s biomass. Even in our petroleum-powered age, the U.S. uses more biomass today (about 165 gigawatts a year) than it did at any point during the 19th century. But whereas biomass became animal feed and firewood back then, today it is mostly corn used for ethanol production\u2014and also firewood, actually. \u201cHistorians have a habit of emphasizing firsts . When is the first viable automobile? When is the first steam engine in America? \u201d Suits said. \u201cBut if you look at the economy, steam engines straight-up don\u2019t matter until the 1860s or \u201970s. You really start to miss that the bulk of any given transformation has to have this layer of infrastructure that enables scaling up.\u201d That is, indeed, Suits and Moyer\u2019s biggest takeaway from working on this project. Energy transitions tend to move faster when they\u2019re able to coast on infrastructure that was built for an earlier purpose. So coal was able to power so much of the economy, so quickly, because it traveled easily by railroad. Petroleum and natural gas became dominant in the 20th century after the pipeline infrastructure was built. Likewise, Moyer said, energy transitions don\u2019t tend to slow down because of the kinds of technologies that consumers are using. Households don\u2019t seem to mind throwing out a coal furnace in their house in exchange for a natural-gas one, she said. Instead, it\u2019s the lack of supply and distribution technology\u2014such as a pipeline or the power grid\u2014that tend to drag transitions down. And likewise, transitions can work more quickly when they\u2019re able to use preexisting infrastructure. So once electric cars have slightly better battery life, she said, their basic obstacle to mass adoption is likely to be the lack of charging infrastructure, not the fact that many people will already own a gas-powered car. I sent the chart to two other energy experts to get their thoughts. Emily Grubert , an engineering professor at Georgia Tech, noted that nearly all of the transitions depicted were accidental or the result of market forces. It\u2019s possible that the transition to zero-carbon energy could be faster, she said, because it will be intentional. Sahay, the energy consultant, noticed other details. Electrification\u2019s growth after 1932 was inseparable from the Roosevelt administration\u2019s program of rural electrification, he said. \u201cThe Bureau of Reclamation would build dams on river valleys, and the federal Power Marketing Administrations would sell electricity to reclaim costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese projects not only reduced urban-rural disparity but structurally transformed jobs in the economy from agriculture towards manufacturing and services.\u201d They also made farms more productive. We should use a similar scheme now to electrify the rest of the economy, he said\u2014and, in fact, that\u2019s what Senator Bernie Sanders proposed during the presidential primary. So what does this chart have to do with climate change? The short and glib answer is that this chart is climate change. America has emitted a quarter of the world\u2019s total historic CO\u2082 pollution , 400 billion tons, more than any other country. That is what you\u2019re looking at in this chart, in the jagged slopes of coal power and the unquenched demand for petroleum. The second and maybe just as obvious point is that the U.S. and the entire world need to pull off an energy transition that rivals anything seen in the past two centuries. If you look at the 2019 version of the Sankey diagram, you\u2019ll see the two largest blocks of color represent natural gas and petroleum. \u201cThe stuff we talk about wanting to do isn\u2019t even visible on this chart,\u201d Grubert said. Solar and wind energy are represented by lines only a few pixels wide. \u201cWe have to turn those pencil lines into boxes,\u201d she said. But finally, consider the horses. They were able to get so beefy in the 19th century not because the corn or oats improved, but because selective breeding was suddenly possible. It was possible because railroads existed\u2014which, in turn, ran on coal. That means that horses today are biologically inseparable from how fossil fuels historically transformed them. So are we.

{"id":null,"body":"A new study uses unconventional but more accurate measures of the effect of climate change on the health of marine ecosystems and uncovers more reasons to be concerned Even though the world's oceans and seas aren't warming up as fast as landmass, there is still cause for concern for marine life. A new study published in the journal Science presents evidence that the speed and direction of climate change as well as the timing of seasonal shifts are moving just as fast in large bodies of water as in land, and these point to serious conservation problems for regions rich in marine biodiversity. Scientists led by Scottish Marine Institute ecologist Michael Burrows calculated two metrics -- the velocity of climate change and the shifts in seasonal timing -- that they argue are more accurate gauges of biodiversity, or the health of ecosystems, than traditional temperature records. Using 50 years of global temperature and climate data, they made detailed predictions on the ability of organisms to cope with warming, including biogeographic range shifts and life-cycle changes, that involve much more than simple migration toward the Earth's poles and earlier springs coupled with later autumns. They found that some marine reserves, such as the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia, may be in danger of losing their ambient temperatures rapidly. \"What we have done is think about warming from a different perspective: If I started off at one point experiencing a particular temperature, how fast and in what direction would I need to walk or swim or crawl to remain at exactly the same temperature?\" says co-author David Schoeman . \"This takes the idea of warming and turns it from a question of time to a question of space.\" \r\n\r\n In the gallery below, get a glimpse of species and regions that may be threatened by climate change. Then, in the Q&A with Burrows that follows, learn more about how the study came about, why measuring the velocity of climate change is critical, and the data calculations the researchers conducted for these discoveries. What's the backstory of this project? The work came out of a workshop at the University of California Santa Barbara. A group of us got together to assess the evidence for ocean life responding to climate change. It struck us right away that there were no expectations available for how far organisms should shift to track temperatures or by how much earlier or later they should do things seasonally. We saw that another study had taken an approach to making predictions about speed of movement or velocity of temperatures for possible future climate scenarios on land, and we thought we could do the same for the oceans to give us expectations to go with observed changes. What were your team's key discoveries? When we talk about velocity of climate change, we mean the speed and direction of movement of temperature. So when temperature increases in a particular spot, anything wanting to stay at the same temperature as before needs to move to a cooler place. In an area where there is a very flat thermal landscape, or where temperatures vary little from place to place, that cooler place could be a long way away. And so velocity of climate change would be high. Where cooler places are right next door, like up a nearby mountain range or on the other side of an oceanographic boundary, life only needs to move a short distance to follow temperatures over the same time period. So, the much flatter thermal landscape in the ocean tends to increase velocities, and therefore offsets the effect of greater warming on land to bring the velocities for the two environments closer together. By a similar process, reduced seasonal changes in the ocean tend to push up estimates for seasonal shifts to values close to those for land. Because thermal landscapes and the amount of warming or cooling are different in different parts of the world, there is a lot of variation in velocities. It so happens that there is an awful lot of species in some of the places where velocities are highest, especially in the tropical oceans. That may have damaging effects on the richness of species in those places, especially when there can be no immigrants from even hotter places to replace those that leave. And conservation measures can't usually protect species from direct effects of climate change. We should especially protect those areas, which provide longer term refuges, where velocities are low, and where refugees from climate change may arrive. How was this study conducted? The methods were surprisingly simple to do. What we did was combine the two important trends in temperature for each spot on the globe, one across decades and one from place to place, and that gave us the velocity. A bit like combining a rise in water level with a landscape -- if the slope was gentle we'd expect a little rise in water level to make the water's edge go far horizontally as in a flood plain, but if the slope were steep the same rise wouldn't have much effect on the spread of the water. Working out seasonal shifts was pretty much the same, but for this we used the change in temperature from month to month instead of from place to place. Once we got hold of the publicly available datasets from the U.K.'s University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit and from the Hadley Centre, all we had to do to calculate velocity was to determine the temperature trend over 50 years and the average temperature for every 1-degree grid cell. The next step was to compare each grid cell to its immediate neighbors to find the direction and steepness of the temperature slope, like hills and plains on a landscape. Dividing the 50-year trend by the temperature slope gave us the velocity in the direction of the slope. For seasonal shifts we had to calculate the 50-year trends in temperatures for each month, and get the rate of seasonal change in temperature by taking the difference between temperatures between preceding and following months. Dividing the 50-year trends by rate of seasonal change gave us the seasonal shifts. We picked April and October to show what spring and fall shifts would be.\r\n What are the implications for scientists as well as for people in general? The main thing for me was the realization that life may need to move fast to track even small temperature changes in some parts of the world. And in other places, larger temperature changes might need only small displacements for animals and plants to stay in their preferred temperatures. So an average rate of shift may not be that useful. In essence, regions where we show the fastest velocities may be most prone to the loss of species and potentially gaining new ones, while where velocities are slower there may be some movement of the boundaries of species, fishes ranging further north for example, but probably keeping the same mix for a much longer time. It will be interesting to see who in the scientific world picks up on this approach. For the wider world I would hope that we have highlighted how we might expect life to respond to climate changes, and how much that might change from place to place. Those changes might be startlingly rapid in some areas, with species arriving from hundreds of miles away over just a few years. Although we didn't highlight this in the paper, my view is that area of slower velocities immediately outside the tropics are worthy of special measures. Coral reefs may need new areas to colonize if they are not to go extinct. We need to be ready for those migrants when they arrive. We want to hear what you think about this article.

{"id":null,"body":"The Earth is warming, but Washington is frozen, so localities keep finding new ways to muddle through. Do you believe in climate change? As an international summit meeting on climate change gets underway in Paris this week, the political conversation around global warming in the United States often begins this way: with a question about beliefs. Climate change\u2014like gun control, abortion, or immigration\u2014has become another way for political parties and their members to define themselves. The split is pretty clear. A resounding 86 percent of Democrats believe solid evidence exists to prove the Earth is warming, but just 45 percent of Republicans feel the same way, according to a report \u00a0by the Pew Research Center in June. Things get even messier when you ask people why the Earth is warming: 64 percent of Democrats think human activity is a culprit, but only 22 percent of Republicans agree. This ideological chasm makes the prospects of climate-change legislation at the federal level look dim indeed. Even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and the White House, in 2009 and 2010, the drive to pass a far-reaching law to curb greenhouse-gas emissions unraveled in the Senate, after legislative sponsors from both parties bailed on a plan (dubbed \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d) to use market forces to help energy businesses cut down on pollution. Internationally, the outlook seems just as daunting. The lofty goal of the Paris conference is to sign a legally binding agreement\u2014the result of five years of discussions and deal-making\u2014that aims to reduce carbon emissions significantly by 2050. The U.S. Senate isn\u2019t likely to approve a full-blown treaty, given Republicans\u2019 presumed opposition, so the Obama administration will push for a less sovereignty-challenging version of an international agreement. Regardless of what Americans believe or don\u2019t believe, the average global temperatures have risen \u00a0over the past several decades, according to well-regarded international scientific institutions. A study \u00a0in 2013 of climate scientists who had published papers in peer-reviewed journals found that 97 percent of those who took a position on the causes of global warming agreed that human activity was partly to blame. The world\u2019s sea level has been rising \u00a0at roughly a tenth of an inch per year, according to satellite data collected since the 1990s, which threatens lowlands in places as different as South Florida and New York City. Life is getting hotter in arid places such as Texas, which has seen average daily temperatures rise \u00a0by more than a half-degree per decade since 1970. Rainfall has grown more intense in the Midwest. Americans may disagree on why these things are happening and whether the weather will keep getting worse. But they\u2019re happening. So, if legislative action is stymied that might reduce carbon emissions and thereby prevent the problem from getting worse, what can a greenhouse-baked populace do? The answer is: adapt. And with Washington dysfunctional, local governments and businesses around the country are taking innovative steps to do just that. These steps needn\u2019t be partisan; at the local level, ideology gives way to practicality. In the frontline of extreme weather, people want an end to flooded basements, and they don\u2019t much care much whether believers or nonbelievers, liberals or conservatives, supply the solutions. Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, has studied how cities can learn to bounce back. Local officials don\u2019t need to believe in climate change to respond to it, she says. \u201cThe closer the elected official is to the ground and the more they are required to deliver every day,\" she explains, \"the less they focus on the causes and the more they\u2019re focusing on the reality of these shocks and the fact that they need to prepare for them better.\u201d Look at the small city of Dubuque, Iowa, forced into a $200 million public works project to alleviate flooding that scientists say has been aggravated by climate change. The Republican governor of Iowa sounds indecisive about whether the climate is warming and why, but an increase in sudden, heavy rainfalls during the past several decades finally persuaded Dubuque\u2014with the state government's financial help\u2014to take major steps to prevent the deluges that periodically wash out low-lying neighborhoods along the Mississippi River. When there\u2019s a foot of water in your basement, climate change feels tangible\u2014and smells. A climate event itself can often lead to better planning for extreme weather to come. Aside from the wake-up call for victims, there\u2019s sometimes a practical return\u2014money from the federal or state government. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that every dollar spent \u00a0to protect cities from weather-related damage would save $3 or $4 in recovery work. Once the waters have subsided, the experience sticks. Ask residents in Miami Beach. During the past decade, they\u2019ve experienced an increase in sunny-day flooding, when seawater surges up through storm sewers. Bigger threats could lie ahead; a report \u00a0by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, a bipartisan coalition of four coastal counties in southern Florida, found the sea could rise by as much as two feet by 2060, jeopardizing valuable shoreline\u00a0property. \u201cI think we are a great place to convert nonbelievers into believers on sea-level rise,\u201d says Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, who is currently overseeing the completion of a $400 million project to ease flooding by raising 30 percent of the city's roads, installing pumps, and replenishing dunes, among other measures. The mayor is a registered Democrat but sees this as a nonpartisan issue. \u201cWhen you look at that ocean, it\u2019s not Republican, it\u2019s not Democrat\u2014it just knows how to rise,\u201d he says. Environmental activists haven\u2019t given up on the possibility of action to attack the problem at its source, by trying to halt or at least slow the changes in climate. Solar panels, electric cars, and recycling, not to mention political advocacy, can bring reductions in carbon emissions. But adapting to climate change seems likelier than preventing it. Evidence: A private marketplace is springing up. Take Patrick Bulot, a roofer in Houston, who isn\u2019t particularly swayed one way or the other about the actuality or causes of global warming. Yet he has a patent pending for his \u201cTexas Smart Roof\u201d and has found a niche installing metal roofs meant to keep homes cooler during the city\u2019s scorching summers. Bulot is no environmental crusader. But he\u2019s an innovator, spurred on by the most replicable of motives\u2014earning a buck. The original version of this story said that Bulot already holds the patent for the Texas Smart Roof.","headline":"Adapting to Climate Change ","article_name":426252.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2015\/11\/adapting-to-climate-change\/426252\/","date_published":"2015-11-30 19:00:00","article_length":6736,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:13.040485","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2015\/11\/adapting-to-climate-change\/426252\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"As a global climate crisis deepens, even professional travelers should cut back on their air miles. The sun was still beating down when, one late afternoon earlier this year, I arrived at a dust bowl of baked earth where there should have been water. Lake Abbe, a soda lake on the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti, wasn\u2019t where it was supposed to be. The local Afar people told me that an Ethiopian dam had stanched its inflow to irrigate a sugarcane plantation, and now the shore had receded to the horizon. Lake Abbe is the endpoint of the Awash River, a vital source of water in an ecosystem that is growing drier as local temperatures rise and the global climate crisis deepens. And now, the lake is vanishing. I\u2019d gone to the Horn of Africa in search of timeless landscapes, but there was no respite from humanity\u2019s penchant for remaking geography. It was hard to avoid a sense of complicity. After all, I was there to write a travel story, exhorting other English-speakers to visit the region as if all was well with the world. On that excursion, I would clock up 8,000 miles in flights, exceeding the annual carbon footprint per person recommended by the Swiss nonprofit MyClimate.org by a factor of four in the space of one long-haul round trip. As I stood where Lake Abbe was surrendering to the Grand Barra desert, the newly exposed ground appeared as a premonition of an uninhabitable Earth. A hot breeze blew eddies of dust around my ankles, scolding me. You shouldn\u2019t have come. As this summer\u2019s tourism season draws to a close, anyone in a half-sane society would choose this moment to stop going on far-flung vacations. That\u2019s a hard thing for a travel writer to admit. After family and friends, travel is pretty much my favorite thing\u2014not only my source of income, but an inexhaustible wellspring of curiosity, empathy, and wonder. Read: This land is the only land there is Yet optional travel is also a major contributor to ecocide. Last year, a University of Sydney study examined the environmental impact of the many activities involved in tourism\u2014including transportation, shopping, and more\u2014and found that it accounts for 8 percent of all global carbon emissions, far more than previously imagined. The 100,000 flights a day that now crisscross the skies pump almost as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the 28 member states of the European Union combined. (In the United States, at least, roughly half of all airline trips are for \u201cpersonal leisure purposes.\u201d) In May, a landmark United Nations report into collapsing biodiversity found that humans have severely altered or destroyed about 75 percent of the Earth\u2019s land; while human land use, including agriculture and ranching, was the greatest culprit, climate change was a significant factor as well. Moreover, while the report neglected to say so, the remaining 25 percent is hardly inviolate, as we scramble over one another to Instagram what idylls remain. \u201cGoing someplace far away, we now know, is the biggest single action a private citizen can take to worsen climate change,\u201d the journalist Andy Newman in wrote recently in The New York Times . \u201cOne seat on a flight from New York to Los Angeles effectively adds months worth of human-generated carbon emissions to the atmosphere. And yet we fly more and more.\u201d I certainly have. Since the turn of the millennium, I have amassed approximately 270,000 air miles, equivalent to flying around the planet almost a dozen times over. Based on the correlation between carbon-dioxide output and polar-ice melt established in the 2016 study cited in Newman\u2019s article , this means that my flights alone have accounted for some 90 tons of carbon emissions, enough to melt about 260 square meters of polar sea ice. I have melted a tennis-court-size chunk of the Arctic all on my own. Ignoring the impact of climate change is no longer an option, because I have seen its impact on four continents. In temperate London, where I live, global warming for now means that I didn\u2019t wear a scarf last winter, and the daffodils opened early. Far more tangible are the symptoms of climate crisis I\u2019ve witnessed abroad: shrinking glaciers in the Andes, record-breaking heat waves in southern Europe, the startling expansion of the Gobi desert. It has also become much harder to ignore the alarming testimonies of the people who live among them. Earlier this year, I received an email from a mountain guide I knew in Malawi. He was asking for help because his house had been washed away after Cyclone Idai barreled through southeastern Africa . Every time I settle down to write a travel article lately, I feel like a canary in a coal mine, whistling denial. Perhaps, if my work achieves any kind of posterity, it will be in a museum of defunct pastimes from the Extinction Age. Amid the exhibits of hamburgers and combustion engines will be a gallery of press cuttings from the era of mass tourism, fossils for future, static generations to gawp at, wondering at the excess of their deluded forebears, who continued jetting around the planet even as that planet withered and burned before their eyes. Cutting back on travel, of course, may be just one of many ways in which people can reduce their carbon emissions. We can reinsulate our homes, bicycle to work, modify our diets, lobby for carbon taxes, and more. However, in contrast with other climate villains such as domestic heating, transport, and food, holidays are a luxury, an extravagant add-on to life that we could live without. Our attitude to travel, then, is in many ways a barometer of our response to an urgent question: Can we accept that our pursuit of happiness might be inimical to our survival? Despite the strong scientific consensus about the gravity of climate change, tourism levels are not dropping off. On the contrary, the UN World Tourism Organization forecasts that the industry, fueled by the emerging markets in Asia, will grow by another 30 percent by the end of 2030. Meanwhile, NASA recently announced plans to open the International Space Station to tourists , suggesting that our neophilia now knows no earthly bounds. Read: How climate change could trigger the next global financial crisis The slow death of traditional travel media is, paradoxically, another worrying portent. As I write, National Geographic Traveler has announced that it is shuttering after 35 years. In an Instagram post , the magazine\u2019s editorial projects director, Andrew Nelson, blamed the decision on \u201cthe medium through which you are reading these words.\u201d * \u00a0 Social media, with its elevation of hyper-consumerist, bucket-list-driven travel, now represents a more pervasive form of denial than the travel magazine. A professional photographer\u2019s lush images on a printed page no longer suffice when Facebook users are racing around the globe, competing with their friends to post pictures from the most exotic places. For several decades now, travelers of all sorts have sought excuses to mitigate the damage we are causing the environment. We reassure ourselves that our hotel is eco-friendly, even though we know that banning plastic bottles is a Band-Aid for an emergency that demands a quadruple bypass. We scoff at decommissioning an industry that supports one in 10 jobs worldwide, although we know that a position at a Maldives beach resort won\u2019t be much use when your archipelago ceases to exist . We place vain hope in the fuel-efficient transcontinental maglev trains of futurists\u2019 dreams, despite the fact that they have been dreaming of them fruitlessly for 50 years. But deep down, we know that these are just bromides, and that at least some of the calculus is more coldhearted. If the planet is doomed, I hear the devil on my shoulder rationalize, I\u2019m going to see as much of what remains as I can. With this acknowledgment, I understand that my peripatetic life needs to change. I\u2019ll try to cherish my own home turf more and acknowledge that my responsibility to the planet should coalesce around these few acres of ground. I will travel occasionally, albeit less than before. Where possible, I will take the train rather than fly, but I will fly when there is no alternative, salving my conscience with carbon offsets. But all the while, I will reckon with a gathering sense that regular travelers like me are loving the world to death. And that perhaps this love might be better expressed by letting it be. * Correction: An earlier version of this article included the wrong job title for National Geographic Traveler editorial projects director Andrew Nelson.","headline":"A Future Without Long-Haul Vacations","article_name":597016.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/09\/travel-writer-envisions-future-without-vacations\/597016\/","date_published":"2019-09-02 10:00:00","article_length":8565,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:13.751708","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/09\/travel-writer-envisions-future-without-vacations\/597016\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s time for leafy-green justice. In hindsight, there were plenty of indications over the past decade that American politics were headed toward the partisan sniping and low-stakes media obsessions that crowd the news cycle today. Take Arugulagate. In 2007, Barack Obama was in Iowa, speaking as a presidential hopeful to a group of farmers who were worried about the stagnation of their crop prices while America\u2019s grocery bills continued to rise. In his speech, Obama referred to the inflated cost of arugula at Whole Foods, which was a small gaffe: Iowa didn\u2019t have a Whole Foods, and the leafy vegetable wasn\u2019t then familiar enough to be name-checked in a broad point about American grocery costs. But political media turned arugula into its own news cycle, with conservatives charging Obama with elitism. Around the same time, lattes were also being slandered . It was a big moment for food as proof of one\u2019s true ability to govern. Obama went on to win the 2008 election, but arugula never quite recovered. According to Google Trends data , kale and arugula were of similar popularity in America at the time, but shortly thereafter, kale gained a decisive lead over its counterpart in the competition for America\u2019s Next Top Leaf. Today, arugula trails far behind both kale and spinach in popularity. Americans who heard about it for the first time via political gaffe apparently didn\u2019t leap to give it a try, and it has also been usurped by more novel choices in the progressive corners of food culture that first embraced it as a European crossover. Arugula is neither enduringly trendy, like kale, nor so lame that Millennial irony breathes new life into it, as with iceberg-wedge salads . In spite of all those obstacles, arugula persists in quiet superiority as the best tasting, most versatile, and easiest to prepare of the common greens. All it has ever done is help make things delicious: It\u2019s great as a crunchy topping for sandwiches, piled atop a Neapolitan pizza, or as a nutritious base for a salad. It shouldn\u2019t have to provide all that pleasant, peppery flavor just to reside in a vegetal purgatory between the broad commonality of spinach and kale\u2019s trendy coastal dominance. The vegetable has brought more than enough to the table to earn the ubiquity it\u2019s never had. Arugula was put through the wringer during the 2008 presidential election because Obama\u2019s opponents claimed that it was intolerably fancy. In reality, it just lacked broad American name recognition, which might make something seem more exotic than it really is. It was also vaguely associated with Europe, which is not the same thing as \u201cfancy.\u201d The plant has been around for approximately a zillion years, and it\u2019s even mentioned in the Bible and the Talmud . Geographically, that makes sense: Arugula originates in the coastal Mediterranean. Rocket, roquette , or rucola , as arugula is more commonly known outside the United States, is widely eaten in Europe, and especially in Italy. That commonality translates to America, to a certain extent: Google Trends data suggest that the most interest in the vegetable is concentrated in states with significant Italian American populations. Price-wise, arugula isn\u2019t any less accessible than any other fresh green in the country. At the grocery store in my neighborhood, which is so unimpressive that it regularly lacks at least one essential ingredient for my favorite chicken soup, both the organic and conventional varieties of arugula cost the same per pound as baby spinach, kale, and \u201cspring mix\u201d greens. I don\u2019t know how it compares in price with fris\u00e9e; there wasn\u2019t any in the store, probably because no one has ever wanted to eat fris\u00e9e. Arugula also offers something none of those greens do: It has a distinctly pleasant flavor all its own, even before you dress it, saut\u00e9 it, or layer it on top of a burger. The plant is frequently described as peppery or even spicy. That might be overstating it a bit, but it still provides more than just a bit of crunchy nutrition to the meals it joins. Even better, it doesn\u2019t quickly get limp and soggy, unlike chopped romaine. Arugula\u2019s small, tender leaves and thin stems are ready to eat with just a quick wash, unlike kale, which requires the preparer to dismantle it and beat it into submission. Arugula should be such an easy sell, if not tarnished by political backbiting. To understand what was holding it back and what could be done, I spoke to Darby Hughes, the brand-strategy director at Quench, a marketing agency focused on the food and beverage industry. He said the solution might lie in the foreign markets where the plant is already a dietary staple: a different name. \u201cWhat if we embrace the name \u2018rocket\u2019? That might very well destigmatize it,\u201d he says. Hughes cautions that before growers rebrand their entire business, they should run some tests on potential names to see whether the idea is indeed wise. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt my existing sales to arugula fanatics,\u201d he says. But I feel like we leafheads (if I may) would seek out our fix no matter the name. And rebranding has had huge upsides for other fresh foods. Hughes notes that the Chilean sea bass got its name after its real moniker, Patagonian toothfish, failed to connect with anyone. With its more stylish title, the species has become a well-known symbol of seafood sophistication. If arugula\u2014excuse me, rocket\u2014were to gain the American dietary prominence it so richly deserves, it would probably be relatively simple for the country\u2019s farmers to keep up with the demand. In an interview for PBS in 2017 , Carl Glanzman, an arugula farmer, said that cultivating the green is simple. \u201cIt thrives well on total abuse,\u201d he says, which may be why arugula still stands a chance at all in America. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mind growing with grass. It doesn\u2019t mind growing with other weeds.\u201d It grows all year and is resistant to cold weather. That hardiness might give the plant an additional edge on a popular green competitor: Much of the country\u2019s winter romaine lettuce comes from just one part of Arizona , which has made it vulnerable to foodborne-illness outbreaks that have wiped out availability across America for months. When you look at the particulars, it sure seems like the vagaries of partisan politics have once again denied Americans the full potential of a thing they might otherwise have enjoyed. But there\u2019s still time for people to let arugula into their hearts. Glanzman\u2019s farm\u2014and many of his rocket-buying restaurant clients\u2014just happens to be in Iowa.","headline":"America Blew It on Arugula","article_name":585571.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2019\/03\/arugula-rocks-come-at-me-spinach\/585571\/","date_published":"2019-03-25 12:00:00","article_length":6533,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:14.316391","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2019\/03\/arugula-rocks-come-at-me-spinach\/585571\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Even a \u201cminor\u201d skirmish would wreck the planet. When we talk about what causes climate change, we usually talk about oil and gas, coal and cars, and\u2014just generally\u2014energy policy. There\u2019s a good reason for this. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which enters the atmosphere, warms the climate, and \u2026 you know the drill. The more fossil fuels you burn, the worse climate change gets. That\u2019s why, a couple of years ago, I spent a lot of time covering the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to weaken the country\u2019s fuel-economy standards. It was an awful policy, one that would have led to more oil consumption for decades to come. If pressed, I would have said that it had a single-digit-percentage chance of creating an uninhabitable climate system. But energy is not the only domain that has a direct bearing on whether we have a livable climate or not. So does foreign policy\u2014specifically, nuclear war. Since Russia invaded Ukraine two weeks ago, that threat has become a lot more real: Many Americans, including artists , climate-concerned progressives, and even a few  lawmakers , have come out in support of a \u201cno-fly zone.\u201d But despite its euphemistic name, a no-fly zone means that NATO and the United States issue a credible threat that they will shoot down any enemy plane in Ukrainian territory. This would require U.S. bombing runs into Russian territory to eliminate air defenses, bringing the U.S. and Russia into open war, and it would have a reasonable chance of prompting a nuclear exchange. And it would be worse for the climate than any energy policy that Donald Trump ever proposed. I mean this quite literally. If you are worried about rapid, catastrophic changes to the planet\u2019s climate, then you must be worried about nuclear war. That is because, on top of killing tens of millions of people, even a relatively \u201cminor\u201d exchange of nuclear weapons would wreck the planet\u2019s climate in enormous and long-lasting ways. Read: A 10-year-old nuclear-blast simulator is popular again Consider a one-megaton nuke , reportedly the size of a warhead on a modern Russian intercontinental ballistic missile. (Warheads on U.S. ICBMs can be even larger.) A detonation of a bomb that size would, within about a four-mile radius, produce winds equal to those in a Category 5 hurricane, immediately flattening buildings, knocking down power lines, and triggering gas leaks. Anyone within seven miles of the detonation would suffer third-degree burns , the kind that sear and blister flesh. These conditions\u2014and note that I have left out the organ-destroying effects of radiation\u2014would rapidly turn an eight-mile blast radius into a zone of total human misery. But only at this moment of the war do the climate consequences truly begin. The hot, dry, hurricane-force winds would act like a supercharged version of California\u2019s Santa Ana winds , which have triggered some of the state\u2019s worst wildfires. Even in a small war, that would happen at dozens of places around the planet, igniting urban and wildland forest fires as large as small states. A 2007 study estimated that if 100 small nuclear weapons were detonated, a number equal to only 0.03 percent of the planet\u2019s total arsenal, the number of \u201cdirect fatalities due to fire and smoke would be comparable to those worldwide in World War II.\u201d Towering clouds would carry more than five megatons of soot and ash from these fires high into the atmosphere. All this carbon would transform the climate, shielding it from the sun\u2019s heat. Within months, the planet\u2019s average temperature would fall by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit; some amount of this cooling would persist for more than a decade. But far from reversing climate change, this cooling would be destabilizing. It would reduce global precipitation by about 10 percent, inducing global drought conditions. In parts of North America and Europe, the growing season would shorten by 10 to 20 days. This would prompt a global food crisis the world hasn\u2019t seen in modern times. Corn, wheat, and soybean yields would all decline by more than 11 percent over five years. In a slightly larger conflict\u2014involving, say, 250 of the world\u2019s 13,080 nuclear weapons\u2014the oceans would become less bountiful; the photosynthesizing plankton that form the basis of the marine food chain would become 5 to 15 percent less productive . In the case of a U.S.-Russia war, fishers worldwide would see their catches decline by nearly 30 percent. And even though the world would get cooler, the nuclear winter resulting from a full-blown global conflict (or even \u201cnuclear fall,\u201d as some researchers prefer) would not reverse the effect of what we might morbidly call \u201ctraditional\u201d human-caused climate change. In the short term, the effects of ocean acidification would get worse , not better. The layer of smoke in the atmosphere would destroy as much as 75 percent of the ozone layer. That means that more UV radiation would slip through the planet\u2019s atmosphere, causing a pandemic of skin cancer and other medical issues. It would affect not just humans, either\u2014even on the remotest islands, the higher UV rates would imperil plants and animals otherwise untouched by the global carnage. Nowadays, we don\u2019t tend to think of nuclear war as a climate problem, but concerns over these kinds of dangers were part of how modern climate change achieved political prominence in the first place. During the 1980s, a set of scientists raised the alarm about the effects of a nuclear winter and of the growing \u201chole in the ozone layer.\u201d As the Stanford professor Paul N. Edwards writes in A Vast Machine ,  his magisterial history of climate modeling, these environmental issues taught the world that the planet\u2019s entire atmosphere could come under threat at once, priming the public to understand the risks of global warming. And even before that, climate science and nuclear-weapons engineering were twin disciplines of a sort. John von Neumann, a Princeton physicist and member of the Manhattan Project, took interest in the first programmable computer in 1945 because he hoped that it could solve two problems: the mechanics of a hydrogen-bomb explosion and the mathematical modeling of Earth\u2019s climate. At the time, military interest in meteorology was high. Not only had a good weather forecast helped secure Allied victory on D-Day, but officials feared that weather manipulation would become a weapon in the unfolding Cold War. The worst fears of that era, thankfully, never came to pass. Or at least, they haven\u2019t happened yet. It is up to us to make sure that they don\u2019t. Read: A sicker, poorer, and less abundant world Outside of the direct effects of the bombs themselves, the full effect of a nuclear exchange could be even worse. If several years of gasoline- and diesel-fueled conventional military operations followed the global destruction, then the permanent consequences for the climate system would be even worse. That would also be true if society tried to rebuild by undertaking a fossil-powered reconstruction\u2014and that would very likely be the case. The ruins of our postwar society would be poorer, and fossil reserves are the easiest energy sources to locate. Renewables, wind turbines, and other decarbonization technology, meanwhile, require secure factories, highly educated engineers, and complicated global networks of trade and exchange. They depend, in other words, on everything that peace provides. Solving climate change is a luxury of a planet at peace with itself.","headline":"On Top of Everything Else, Nuclear War Would Be a Climate Problem","article_name":627005.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/nuclear-war-would-ravage-the-planets-climate\/627005\/","date_published":"2022-03-09 14:00:00","article_length":7492,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:14.502047","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/nuclear-war-would-ravage-the-planets-climate\/627005\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Millennials in the GOP want more government action on environmental issues than the older generation. The newest version of the Pew Research Center\u2019s annual environmental poll covers a lot of familiar ground. It finds that most Americans believe the government should be doing more to protect air and water quality, and the climate. But when it comes to deciding how to accomplish those goals, Democrats and Republicans are divided\u2014except on the topic of building more wind and solar energy, which just about everyone loves. But in addition to confirming that these long-held positions haven\u2019t changed, the poll offers two new noteworthy insights. First, it asks Americans how they feel about solar geo-engineering, which entails spraying a chemical into the high atmosphere that will reflect some of the sun\u2019s heat back into space. This is an attempt to mimic the cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, when natural emissions of the same chemical block the sun\u2019s rays. Economists and climate scientists say solar geo-engineering is the most feasible method available to actively cool the warming planet. And Americans are skeptical of it, Pew found. About 70 percent of Americans told the firm that solar geo-engineering would either do \u201cmore harm than good\u201d or have no effect on the environment. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to see promise in geo-engineering, the poll also found. It was the first time the research agency had asked the question, but the results mirror a 2011 poll from the Brookings Institution . In that survey, about 70 percent of Americans said they agreed with the statement that fighting global warming by \u201cadding materials to the atmosphere will cause more harm than good for the environment.\u201d The second bit of intriguing news comes from the poll\u2019s dive into generational attitudes in the Republican party. Millennial Republicans are more likely to endorse centrist environmental positions than their Boomer or Gen X co-partisans, the study found. More than a third of Millennial Republicans agree that the \u201cEarth is warming mostly due to human activity,\u201d as compared to 18 percent of Boomers and older generations. Almost 60 percent of young Republicans say that climate change is having \u201cat least some effect on the United States,\u201d and 45 percent see it active in their community. Nearly half of millennial Republicans say the government is doing too little to \u201creduce effects of climate change,\u201d as compared to 27 percent of Boomer Republicans, the study found. (In comparison, 89 percent of Democrats say the government should do more.) Republican Millennials Are More Likely to Endorse Environmental Positions Than Their Older Peers This might seem like a promising sign for the environmentally concerned. It comes soon after a coalition of College Republican clubs endorsed a tax on carbon pollution . And it fits with a number of other polls that find young Republicans are more environmentally inclined than their predecessors. But \u201cit\u2019s not clear that just because millennials are a little more liberal than other generations, that they\u2019re going to stay that way,\u201d said Dan Kahan , a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School. \u201cIt always looks like the upcoming generation is becoming more liberal\u2014but if that\u2019s the case, they must be getting more conservative as they get older.\u201d \u201cI think that anyone who\u2019s banking on Millennials being more liberal in their 40s or 50s might discover this is not exactly what pans out,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat does Trump say? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. \u201d And even if these shifts do hold\u2014especially in the Republican party\u2014it isn\u2019t clear they would mean anything politically, he said. Climate change and the environment are low-priority issues for most voters, compared to the economy and national security. Americans don\u2019t necessarily choose to vote for a party because of its environmental policy. Or as Kahan put it: \u201cA congressperson knows that if they don\u2019t do what people want on an issue like this, then they\u2019re not necessarily going to get punished.\u201d","headline":"Younger Republicans Are Slightly More Liberal on Climate Change","article_name":560312.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/young-republicans-are-slightly-more-liberal-on-climate-change\/560312\/","date_published":"2018-05-14 16:00:00","article_length":4049,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:15.608603","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/05\/young-republicans-are-slightly-more-liberal-on-climate-change\/560312\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In an interview, the former secretary of state talks about the climate news that makes him want to curse, and his new alliance with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Leonardo DiCaprio. As for the sordid saga of American politics and climate change, John Kerry has not quite seen it all, but he has seen a whole lot of it. He was there in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, when the first global climate treaty was negotiated. Four years later, he was denouncing President George W. Bush from the Senate floor after he withdrew the United States from that pact. In 2009, Kerry was one of three bipartisan senators who tried\u2014 and failed \u2014to pass an ambitious climate bill. As secretary of state in 2014, he negotiated the first climate agreement between the United States and China. It cleared the way, in 2015, for the global Paris Agreement, which he also helped negotiate. Somewhere in this two-decade period he also ran for president. This weekend, Kerry returned to the breach, joining with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, to launch a new bipartisan group that aims to unify the public behind climate action. It is named World War Zero , a reference both to its goal of an American economy with net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to the wartime-style mass mobilization that Kerry says can get us there. Read: Why solving climate change will be like mobilizing for war Other than that mid-century goal, though, World War Zero will not endorse any particular candidate or climate policy. ( As The New York Times noted , its supporters are split on the virtues of fracking.) Instead, it aims to offer a unifying story that can anchor other efforts, focused on the economic benefits of climate action and the national-security and public-health risks of climate change. It will back up that story with star power. Leonardo DiCaprio, Ted Danson, and Sting are all involved, as is John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio. Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, and Cindy McCain are also members. Retired leaders, including General Stanley McChrystal, represent at least three branches of the military. Ashton Kutcher , a noteworthy Iowan who now sits on the board of the Washington-based think tank New America, is also involved. Kerry spoke with me yesterday from Los Angeles. Our conversation touched on whether the Paris Agreement is working, how the next four years could prove \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and how Big Finance could save the world. We also talked briefly about the impeachment proceedings, which have featured several State Department employees whom Kerry knew. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Robinson Meyer: Tell me a little bit about the new group, World War Zero. What can it accomplish that other groups can\u2019t? John Kerry: First of all, there are some terrific efforts out there by a lot of groups. But I think we bring something very unique to the table, which is the joining of unlikely allies who don\u2019t agree on everything at all, who come from different places ideologically \u2026 but all of whom believe that it\u2019s critical to urgently deal with climate change in a very different way from where we are. We\u2019re not fighting about the difference between fracking, or the carbon fee and who gets what, or the Green New Deal. We\u2019re really focused on getting everybody on the same page: that the goal of 2045, 2050 for a low-carbon, no-net-carbon economy is critical. Let\u2019s get everybody moving in that same direction, agreed that we have to reach that goal urgently\u2014almost treating it like war, literally. Because if we don\u2019t get on a war footing in order to do what we have to do \u2026 we\u2019re not going to make it. We\u2019re not going to get the job done\u2014to do what we set out to do in Paris and elsewhere, that the scientists tell us we have to do. Meyer: Do you think the challenge in climate in the United States right now is getting everyone to accept the problem\u2014or is it getting everyone on the same page about what the policy is going to be? Why do we need this big narrative? Kerry: Because it\u2019s only by getting people to buy in and recognize the upside options that you\u2019re going to change the other narrative. We\u2019re trapped right now. And so how do you break out of that trap? I believe you break out of that trap by having conversations with people and motivating people to activate themselves \u2026 so that it becomes an actionable belief taken into elections and into boardrooms and into stockholder meetings and into the halls of Congress. Meyer: What\u2019s the biggest part of that trap\u2014is it partisan? Kerry: No, it\u2019s not partisan. It\u2019s not partisan. The biggest part of it is simply that you\u2019re getting people to believe sufficiently that they can make a difference by working the democracy, and that they are investing in getting the job done. That means you are ultimately gonna politicize yourself. You\u2019re going to become involved in that system, and you\u2019re going to go out, and most importantly, you\u2019re going to vote your future. We\u2019re not going to tell them who to vote for. We\u2019re not going to back candidates, but we\u2019re going to try to generate enough energy that people are interested in making sure that they get the job done here. Meyer: It seems like on the one hand, you\u2019re not backing candidates, and you\u2019re saying climate change isn\u2019t partisan. On the other hand, this is a very specific set of Republicans that you\u2019ve brought together, and they don\u2019t seem like the rising force in the Republican Party right now. Do you really think this is not a partisan issue? Kerry: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a partisan issue. I think it\u2019s been made an ideological issue by some people. But I believe that the vast majority of Americans want to deal with facts, and they want to deal with reality. And if they\u2019re presented with that over a period of time, by people who they know are trustworthy and thoughtful and experienced, I believe we will change the conversation. Meyer: We\u2019re talking about folks eventually voting on this issue. Do you think the survival of the Paris Agreement rests on the 2020 U.S. election? Kerry: [ Pause .] Um, the reason I\u2019m hesitating is that the president, I believe by executive order, has the right to say that he is going to take the government out. Meyer: Yes. Kerry: But something extraordinary is happening in America, which is that states have passed renewable-portfolio laws, and so you\u2019ve got [37] states in our country that are locked in already to moving towards Paris, no matter what the president does. You also have the mayor of every major city in America signed on to the mayor\u2019s commitment to try to live by the Paris Agreement. So you have this dichotomy in America, where the president of the United States has said I\u2019m out , but, frankly, the majority of the American people are still saying, We\u2019re in . Meyer: Do you think that dichotomy is powerful enough to counteract the U.S. leaving? Kerry: No. It\u2019s not counter enough; it\u2019s not powerful enough. It\u2019s powerful enough to continue to mitigate to some degree. But ultimately, not having a president committed to this is going to be a disaster globally. We\u2019re losing the momentum, and actors in the world are using the American absence and lack of commitment as an excuse to cover for their desire not really to rush themselves. We saw this in the negotiations in Poland. Meyer: I think that\u2019s what I mean here, in that we\u2019re seeing other countries hiding behind the U.S. withdrawal. Kerry: Correct. Meyer: And if that withdrawal then extends another four years \u2026 Kerry: If it extends another four years, it\u2019s catastrophic for the notion that we\u2019re going to somehow meet this challenge\u2014with one exception. If Big Finance, Big Business, says we\u2019re going to move no matter what, we\u2019re going to do this, that could save the day, actually. But absent that, the lack of a president being committed to this is catastrophic. Meyer: It\u2019s funny; I was remembering a press conference you gave back during the Paris negotiations , where you said that the Paris Agreement was \u201ca signal to global markets.\u201d Kerry: Correct. And for the first year, Rob, that worked. For the first year, about $358 billion went into renewables. It was the first time that more money went to renewable than fossil fuel ever. So it worked. Meyer: Is it continuing? Kerry: It continued for about two years, and now it\u2019s slacked off. There\u2019s a lot of investment still, but it\u2019s not at the level that it needs to be or we anticipated, or that you would have if you had a president who was really screaming about this. Meyer: Do you think the Paris Agreement has worked as anticipated? Kerry: Not as anticipated, because of the interference of our president\u2014I mean, the fact that the president pulled out hugely stemmed the momentum. And that\u2019s another reason for our creating World War Zero. Unless we get this thing on a kind of presidential-leadership, wartime footing, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to meet the goals. Meyer: This is a bit forward-looking, but let\u2019s say the winning candidate in 2020 wants to do something about climate change. How should America then rebuild its credibility on Paris or on climate? Should it immediately rejoin? Or should it try to set some goals first and show the world it\u2019s serious? Kerry: Well, I think every presidential candidate has already said that they\u2019re committed to rejoining Paris. So the answer is yeah, they should say we\u2019re going to rejoin. But I think that we have to leverage immediately the raising of ambition by everybody. And that requires remarkable presidential leadership. You\u2019re going to need to sit down and negotiate with countries. We\u2019re going to have to put real money on the table together with other countries that can afford it. I mean, basically, the [Group of 20] has the ability to really solve the problem. The fact that the G20 could only put $20 million on the table for the Amazon fire is a disgrace. They\u2019ve never really fully funded the Green Climate Fund. So there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. But I think if a president came along and immediately began to do those things \u2026 it\u2019s doable. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exasperating about this. It is doable, but you don\u2019t see a very specific set of proposals for how you do it. For instance, bringing the auto manufacturers into the White House and sitting them down and saying: \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got to move this faster. I want to know what the hurdles are. I want to know how we take them out of your way. I want to know what kind of incentives we\u2019re going to need for people to be able to afford to buy the electric car.\u201d Then you\u2019ve got to bring the utility people in. Meyer: That\u2019s the kind of wartime footing you\u2019re imagining, this mobilization of the private sector. Kerry: That is precisely what it is. People will competitively protect themselves if it\u2019s simply left up to the outside process. But if, on the other hand, the president is enlisting everybody in this endeavor, then you\u2019ve got the opportunity to eliminate those kinds of hurdles, and people join up, and boom! You\u2019ve got the kind of energy that\u2019s really going to get the job done. I don\u2019t doubt America\u2019s ability to do that for an instant, but clearly it\u2019s not going to happen with this\u2014with where we are today. But World War Zero is not going to be talking about Trump. This is the first mention you\u2019ve heard me say, and I\u2019m saying, we\u2019re not going to talk about it. We\u2019re not focused on candidates. We\u2019re focused on the ideas and on what has to happen. Meyer: What\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened on climate that you didn\u2019t anticipate, since your last day as secretary of state? Kerry: I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t anticipate it, but I think the best thing that\u2019s happened is the reduction in the price of solar and wind. It\u2019s been what we did predict, but it\u2019s the best thing that has happened in terms of the technical, physical component of meeting the challenge. The best thing that has happened\u2014beyond the technical component of it\u2014is the engagement of young people on a global basis, the fact that they\u2019re kicking butt out there, going out there and trying to hold people accountable. Ultimately, I think that will translate into the kind of political accountability that existed back in 1970, when the Dirty Dozen were held accountable. Meyer: What\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s happened? Kerry: The worst thing is the fact that the largest nations have reneged on genuine efforts to really get there and are playing a game\u2014a very dangerous game\u2014with it. The fact that emissions are going up in the United States, they\u2019re going up in Europe, they\u2019re going up in China, they\u2019re going up in India, they\u2019re going up in countless countries in the world, that is just\u2014I could use an expletive, but it\u2019s really unacceptable. It\u2019s outrageous. Meyer: You\u2019re welcome to use an expletive. Kerry: You know, suffice it to say that it\u2019s \u2026 outrageously unacceptable. It\u2019s just disgraceful. And the public ultimately is going to catch up and hold people accountable for this kind of indifference. Meyer: So I have to ask. You were the 68th secretary of state. There have been two since you. Right now, the president is attacking members of the Foreign Service and State Department career employees. If you were in Secretary Mike Pompeo\u2019s shoes, with your boss, the president, attacking your employees, what would you do? Kerry: Well, I\u2019m not going to get into that. I can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not going to get into the politics, which is what it is, of the current administration. I\u2019m trying to build an organization here that is going to be bipartisan and bring people together, not split them apart. Meyer: Did you work with any of the witnesses? Kerry: Suffice it to say\u2014Yes, I did work with them, Marie Yovanovitch and many others, David Hale, all these people. But I do want to say how proud I was of those who testified and their courage in defining the best of foreign policy and the best of Foreign Service, and I think America should be very grateful that we have public servants like that. Meyer: You were the last candidate who tried to unseat a Republican president in a midterm. I realize you\u2019re trying to build a bipartisan organization now, but do you have advice for the current set of candidates who have the same aspiration? Kerry: I don\u2019t have anything to say about the presidential thing this morning. I mean, that\u2019s not just what I\u2019m involved in right now. I may some time in the future, but I\u2019m not today. Meyer: What\u2019s the next step for World War Zero? Kerry: The first thing [people] should do is go to WorldWarZero.com , enlist on the website. We\u2019re very specific with giving people things that they can do in their local communities to begin this process of building. But next year, we will have several mobilizations of people on a large scale. We need people to be involved in that. And we\u2019ll also be doing these town halls in order to talk about real options. We\u2019ll have experts and people who are demystifying this and trying to bring it down to Earth. No pun intended.","headline":"John Kerry\u2019s New Bipartisan, Star-Studded \u2018War\u2019 on Climate Change","article_name":602833.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/john-kerry-interview-climate-catastrophic-world-war-zero\/602833\/","date_published":"2019-12-02 16:51:36","article_length":15002,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:16.014231","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/john-kerry-interview-climate-catastrophic-world-war-zero\/602833\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Negotiations in Washington, D.C., are far more important than those in Glasgow, Scotland. It has been bizarre, over the past few weeks, to see the attention lavished on the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The summit was lauded as the world\u2019s \u201c last, best hope \u201d and the place where the \u201c fate of the planet \u201d would be negotiated. And fine, it was very important. But Glasgow was not, last week or now, the world\u2019s most important city for staving off climate change. That title belongs to Washington, D.C. Over the next few weeks, Democrats in Congress will make a far more influential and far-reaching decision than anything that happened at the UN conference. They will decide whether to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s signature spending bill, the Build Back Better Act. Because of the president\u2019s slim majorities in Congress, the bill\u2019s fate will be decided by just seven Democrats: five moderates in the House of Representatives and two moderate senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. With only $555 billion in climate spending , the act is no green dream: Progressives once contemplated a $10 trillion climate law. In size and approach, the Biden bill is far closer to a patriotic moderate\u2019s ideal of climate policy, beefing up strategic industries through subsidies, federal support, and tax credits. The bill neither mandates greenhouse-gas reductions nor requires utilities to shut down fossil-fuel generation. Yet it now seems likely to be a hinge point in the country\u2019s history. Its passage would, yes, end America\u2019s 30-year failure to plan for the energy transition, and it would vindicate the approach of the Paris Agreement, which places no constraints on U.S. sovereignty. But with their vote for Build Back Better, lawmakers will be doing more than shaping environmental politics. They will be deciding the future of U.S.-China relations, and they will be molding the strength of the American economy itself. If Build Back Better passes, the United States will have a coherent climate strategy for the first time in decades. That strategy will, notably, be shaped only somewhat by environmentalists, activists, and neoclassical economists. The Biden administration\u2019s labor, national-security, and protectionist concerns will have played a larger role. Through subsidies, investment, and some regulations, the country\u2019s policy will seek to reshape the American economy so that it is set to produce new zero-carbon technology for itself and the world. More important, the bill would position the U.S. as a counterweight to China, a rival clean-energy superpower. Right now, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of wind and solar energy. It is the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles , and it looks certain to overshoot its goal of making EVs a quarter of all new car sales by 2025. China\u2019s leadership is adopting clean energy so aggressively not only because it wishes to reduce air pollution and stop the climate-fueled expansion of the Gobi Desert\u2014but because as long as China depends on foreign oil, it has a geopolitical weak spot . But that geopolitical need has created dilemmas for both American companies and American diplomats. If China subsidizes homegrown clean-energy technologies, it will get better at making those technologies more cheaply than the United States can. Its companies will be able to sell those same technologies abroad, dominating markets, such as steel- and automaking, long at the core of American dominance. The Biden administration\u2019s strategy for dealing with China and other authoritarian states requires creating a global network of democracies to counteract their influence. But residents of those democracies\u2014the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union\u2019s member states\u2014care deeply about climate change, and China\u2019s geopolitical need  to develop clean energy could \u200b\u200bmake it an alluring ally, if it can credibly position itself as doing more about climate change than ailing America. But if Build Back Better fails, then the United States will plainly be incapable of responding to climate change in any organized or systematic way. The U.S. Congress\u2014really, the Senate\u2014will have killed President Bill Clinton\u2019s carbon-reducing BTU tax in 1994, doomed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, declined to pass Waxman-Markey in 2010, and abandoned Biden\u2019s climate bid in 2021. This final failure will be massively delegitimizing for the United States and for small- d democracy around the world. And because Democrats are likely to lose control of the House and the Senate next year, it would resound for years. The failure to pass Build Back Better will worsen climate change, of course\u2014but we will not feel those effects for several decades. In the meantime, political camaraderie will deteriorate. Already, a sense that the government cannot safeguard ordinary people\u2019s interests is feeding the country\u2019s disunion. Congress\u2019s failure to do anything about climate change\u2014even pass a bill that 58 percent of Americans support \u2014will only send Americans into less hopeful directions. Young people, living in a country that cannot ensure their future safety, could easily grow more radical. The tens of millions of young people who once championed the Green New Deal have lately started to wonder aloud about a form of property destruction that they call \u201cdirect action\u201d; Andreas Malm\u2019s book, How to Blow Up a Pipeline , got a not-unflattering write-up in The New York Times . The country\u2019s technology and financial elite will be tempted to admire authoritarian states for their efficiency and can-do spirit. And large companies will still need to hire professional, college-educated Americans with disproportionately liberal views who will demand that executives continue to reduce those companies\u2019 carbon pollution, further disrupting American energy markets and prompting a rupture with rural fossil-fuel communities. The American economy will probably transition away from fossil fuels anyway. But instead of a controlled shift, it will be closer to an economic disaster. Coal towns and the oil patch will be stunned by a ruthless market, shaped by technocrats and the subsidizing whims of Beijing, before their final economic value is strip-mined by financiers. And though the U.S. will consume green technology, its technological advantage will slowly slip in China\u2019s and Europe\u2019s favor, and just as the U.S. no longer produces solar panels \u2014a technology that it invented\u2014so will it lose its early advantage in the clean-steel, carbon-capture, electric-vehicle, and hydrogen industries. Manchin should know, personally, that Build Back Better is the best deal that he and West Virginia are likely to get. The pressure to act on climate change has grown in the past few years because fires, floods, and heat waves have grown worse. The California utility PG&E may have been, as The  Wall Street Journal  put it , the first bankruptcy of climate change, but it will not be the last. Liberal bankers will become more agitated by climate change with every new fire season and every corporate collapse. This bill does not include a carbon tax and does contain economic-development initiatives for Appalachia. But in a bleaker future, a carbon tax, now unpopular with Democrats, could come back, and a West Virginia senator may not be in the position next time to stop it. It\u2019s not hard to make a plausible case that the Paris Agreement is working . At the initial Paris meeting, in 2015, countries collectively pledged emissions reductions that would limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Their actual policies\u2014the laws on the books\u2014would have put the world on track for 3.6 degrees Celsius by 2100. Five years later, the world has closed that gap. National policies now put us on track for 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100. And the pledges and targets made under the agreement, depending on how you count them, would put the world closer to an end-of-century warming of 2.4 degrees Celsius. All of these numbers, though, hang on a thin agreement among nations to act as if they\u2019re important. Glasgow\u2019s purported theme was \u201ckeeping 1.5 degrees Celsius alive.\u201d But until the drafting of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the world had agreed to limit warming to only 2 degrees Celsius. That year, the small island nations won a last-minute, extremely contingent concession that placed the 1.5-degree goal in the agreement. This number represents the world\u2019s best intentions, and having it on paper matters, in some way. But the Paris Agreement itself starts from a place of failure: Fighting climate change requires changes to domestic policy. The UN has no ability to mandate changes to domestic policy, so how do you proceed? Ultimately, the countries that say they will reduce emissions have to reduce emissions. And in the U.S., that means passing Biden\u2019s plan.","headline":"The Seven Lawmakers Who Will Decide the Climate\u2019s Fate","article_name":620723.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/the-seven-lawmakers-who-will-decide-the-climates-fate\/620723\/","date_published":"2021-11-17 11:00:00","article_length":8912,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:16.223843","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/the-seven-lawmakers-who-will-decide-the-climates-fate\/620723\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The GOP is ceding important ground by tolerating and encouraging denialism on this critical topic. Mitt Romney's remarks on NBC's Meet the Press earlier this month rankled environmental activists hoping for a bipartisan approach to climate change. \"I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet,\" the Republican presidential nominee told David Gregory. \"I'm in this race to help the American people.\" The comment was meant as a dig at some of President Obama's more high-flying rhetoric from the 2008 campaign, but it also laid bare a significant difference in outlook between the parties: When it comes to the issue of climate change, Republicans have taken a decidedly unrealistic tack. The available evidence overwhelmingly suggests that climate change is real; that extreme weather events are increasing, likely due to climate change; and that this dynamic will have an impact on American national-security interests, if it hasn't already. This year's curiously hot summer was accompanied by the worst drought that the U.S. has experienced in 50 years -- a phenomenon that not only hurts Americans, but is having ripple effects throughout the world as crops wither and food prices increase in nations that can barely afford the price shocks. But the GOP's leading political figures have not been raising the alarm about the connection. That's unfortunate -- both for the GOP and for America. While the GOP has traditionally held an electoral advantage on national-security issues -- something that apparently will not be the case in this year's election -- its stance on environmental issues also could have a decidedly negative impact on American national security. Climate change denialism remains a powerful current within the Republican party, and is a stance honored by most of the candidates who sought this year's GOP presidential nomination. Though Romney argued for reductions in carbon emissions when he governed Massachusetts, he changed his tune on the campaign trail. He said at one point that he thought the world was getting hotter, but added, \"I don't know that, but I think that it is.\" As to human contributions, Romney allowed, \"It could be a little. It could be a lot.\" On another occasion, Romney stated outright , \"My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.\" Meanwhile, the evidence that climate change is a real and pressing problem continues to mount . Not only do heat records continue to fall, but the extreme weather events that we have seen with increasing regularity further underscore the problem. As James Hansen, who directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, wrote recently about a new analysis he conducted of six decades of temperature data, \"our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change.\" Events that can be attributed to climate change, according to his research, include the deadly heat wave that gripped Europe in 2003, the heat wave that rocked Russia in 2010 and caused spontaneous fires, and the droughts that have hit Texas and Oklahoma. This is not a \"soft\" issue that should be of concern only to environmentalists. Climate change can be destabilizing in international affairs, a fact that the Department of Defense is now trumpeting. As the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report notes , climate change contributes to food and water scarcity, provoking or exacerbating mass migrations, and amping up conflicts over resources. The report states, \"While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.\" We have seen this dynamic at play in recent years. The global food crisis of 2008 was destabilizing, causing unrest in the Middle East, Africa, and South America; and this summer's drought will similarly be felt throughout the world. As Robert Thompson, who studies food security at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs, recently said , \"What happens to the U.S. supply has an immense impact around the world. If the price of corn rises high enough, it also pulls up the price of wheat. I think we are in for a very serious situation worldwide.\" The full impact the drought will have throughout the globe remains to be felt, but we can already see world food prices rising . Some prominent Republicans have admirably tried to reframe the debate within the party by arguing that climate change should be seen as a national security problem. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham co-wrote a New York Times  op-ed with John Kerry in 2009 arguing in favor of climate-change legislation; Inside Energy , a prominent newsletter examining federal energy policies, notes that former Virginia senator John Warner has also argued that \"climate change is a national security issue because it could spawn global conflicts that could require a response by the U.S. military.\" It is past time for Republican leaders to come around to this reality, and for candidates to formulate a fact-based approach to this significant problem. Environmental issues and national security ones are increasingly intertwined, with climate change the leading edge of this connection. It isn't clear that Republicans will lose electoral support if their environmental policies have a second-order consequence of making the U.S. less safe, though they may (already, some evidence suggests that failure to appeal to environmentally-minded voters is costing the GOP). What is clear, though, is that ignoring climate change won't make it go away -- and that America will be worse off if Republicans fail to act.","headline":"Time for the GOP to Get Serious About Climate Change, the New National Security Issue","article_name":262428.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/09\/time-for-the-gop-to-get-serious-about-climate-change-the-new-national-security-issue\/262428\/","date_published":"2012-09-17 16:25:10","article_length":5726,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:17.002246","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/09\/time-for-the-gop-to-get-serious-about-climate-change-the-new-national-security-issue\/262428\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"As people flock to see the world\u2019s receding frozen wonders, they\u2019re also encountering freak accidents. In the summer of 1987, a woman visiting Alaska was crushed by a 1,000-pound chunk of ice. According to news reports at the time, Thais Grabenauer, 59, had been taking pictures with her husband at the foot of Exit Glacier, a towering wall of ice that\u2019s one of the most popular attractions in Kenai Fjords National Park. A half-ton piece of the glacier calved off as the couple was snapping, killing Grabenauer and injuring her husband. It was one of those wrong place, wrong time tragedies that seem unlikely to happen again. But in the three decades since Grabenauer\u2019s death, it has happened again\u2014in Alaska and around the rest of the world. In 2009, for instance, two brothers crossed a safety barrier on New Zealand\u2019s Fox Glacier and were buried under a collapsing ice shelf. On a single day last July, two people were killed at separate glaciers in south-central Alaska: A 32-year-old woman was crushed by a collapsing ice ceiling on Byron Glacier, and a 5-year-old boy was hit by a rock falling from Worthington Glacier. Deaths like these remain rare, but they\u2019re also telling cases of a broader trend. In recent years, people have been increasingly flocking to the world\u2019s glaciers. This boom in \u201c glacier tourism \u201d seems to be dually spurred, at least in part, by climate change: For one, people seem eager to glimpse the majestic monuments of ice before they melt away. And as ice sheets disappear, many glaciers are becoming more accessible\u2014and unstable. The result is that places such as Exit Glacier are not only witnessing more tourists than ever crossing rocky, dangerous terrain; they\u2019re also becoming better poised for those wrong place, wrong time misfortunes. Cape Town is an omen. Every year, nearly 300,000 people come to Kenai Fjords National Park, which sprawls along the southern coast of Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula and includes the vast majority of the Harding Icefield. Exit Glacier is the sole glacier accessible by road in the park. The managers now close the area at the base of the glacier each summer to protect people from falling ice, snow, and rocks. But the closure \u201cis mostly just to keep people from going up the sides of the glacier,\u201d says Mark Walters, who works in the Exit Glacier visitor center. \u201cThere\u2019s a way onto it higher up.\u201d Most summer days, Trevor Kreznar leads visitors up this path to give them the chance to walk across the glacier and climb down into the crevasses. Kreznar works for Exit Glacier Guides, a guiding business that has operated for 14 seasons, over which it has more than doubled its number of guides due to increased demand. \u201cI would say maybe 10 percent of the [customers] have been on a glacier before,\u201d Kreznar estimates. Nevertheless, Exit Glacier Guides has never had an accident on the ice, he says. It briefs clients on safety, and the guides know the glacier well; Exit Glacier moves downhill about a foot a day in the summer, changing the nature of the ice day by day. Not everyone shares this track record of safety. Around the world, people are hurt on glaciers every year. Some are mountaineers making attempts on dangerous climbs across glaciers, like a Slovakian man who slid deep into a crevasse on the Kahiltna Glacier while trying to descend Alaska\u2019s Denali in 2017. (The 1992 climbing season on Denali saw 11 deaths in a single three-week period, according to the Alaska Division of Public Health .) Others are casual tourists just trying to get close to the ice, like a 17-year-old who died earlier this year when he fell into a crevasse while hiking on Switzerland\u2019s Gorner Glacier with his dad. \u201c[Accidents] on the snow bridges and snow caves, that\u2019s inexperience,\u201d Kreznar says. \u201cOne side of it is people who are basically ignorant to it, and [the other side is] people knowingly taking risks.\u201d The 5-year-old boy who was hit by the rock from Worthington Glacier earlier this year was hiking with his family on a commonly used trail in a state recreation site. The glacier is just east of the small city of Valdez, which is wreathed by glaciers, some of which are remote while others are highway accessible. Lee Hunt, the executive director of the Valdez Adventure Alliance, which operates the park containing Worthington Glacier, says about 100,000 unique visitors make their way to the site every year. The organization has added more warning signs and tries to remind people that glaciers can be dangerous, she says: \u201cThere are trails that go up to the toe of the glacier \u2026 but you know, people can\u2019t resist scrambling up the sides. There is something definitely alluring about glaciers.\u201d Every year, the Kenai Fjords National Park officers get complaints about tourists not being able to get close enough to Exit Glacier. The glacier has receded much farther than the trails surrounding it originally reached. South of Anchorage, another popular glacier, Portage Glacier, is still referred to as a \u201croadside\u201d glacier, though it\u2019s receded too far to be seen from the road. The only way to walk up to it now in the summer is to hike a mountain pass and cross several deep, fast rivers on a glacial plain. Boats are increasingly used to cross the widening lake at the glacier\u2019s foot. That trend is not unique to North America. In Iceland, where tourism has skyrocketed in the past decade, glaciers and ice caves have become key attractions. On the Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice cap, the largest ice cap in Europe, where the ends of glaciers jump out onto gravel plains, guides and park managers have been busily extending trails and taking vehicles farther to access the glaciers as they recede across the landscape. There are bridges scattered around the country built to cross streams that have since moved entirely out from under them. The victims of climate change are already here. To date, there haven\u2019t been many incidents of injury on Iceland\u2019s glaciers, says Hans Welling, a researcher with the University of Iceland who has written about glacier tourism . Extensive tourism and national-park systems are still relatively new for the country, he notes. Now that glaciers have moved farther back, some entrepreneurs are opening other tour options on glacial lakes, such as kayaking. There\u2019s one glacial lake, the Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon, that an estimated 40 percent of the tourists in Iceland visit. But many visitors are still focused on the ice, Welling says. Glaciers in Iceland, like other places, recede at different rates each year depending on a variety of conditions. Welling says that Iceland\u2019s parks have not traditionally considered climate change in their park plans, so now park managers have to strategize around the shifting rates and figure out ways to handle tourists coming to the parks. \u201cThere are some very popular glaciers because they come in on a very shallow bay and they recede on a 100-meter-a-year basis,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on the parks. Now that some of [the glaciers] are receding, they have to extend their infrastructure.\u201d Kreznar, Hunt, and Welling all said one reason many tourists gave for wanting to see glaciers is because of the feeling that it was their last chance to do so. \u201cSome folks are really into the environmental aspect of it, some folks are really into the science aspects of it, some folks are definitely just into the aesthetics of it. And then you have other folks who are really into the athleticism of it,\u201d Kreznar says. All appear to be part of a growing recognition that many of nature\u2019s most picturesque scenes are fragile and changing. Climate change is a slow creep: Often the shifts happen too gradually for people to see them in action. Glaciers, on the other hand, are disappearing in real time. On warm days, tourists can watch rivulets of water run off the surfaces of the ice, draining away into streams. Still, it\u2019s likely that people visiting glaciers may not anticipate consequences quite as immediate as dislodged half-ton chunks of ice. The growing risks to travelers on melting glaciers are cruel reminders of all the smaller-scale and sometimes unpredictable damages climate change can inflict\u2014even in the places where its broadest impacts are most visible.","headline":"Glaciers Falling on Tourists: Yet Another Danger of Climate Change","article_name":569929.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/09\/climate-change-look-out-below\/569929\/","date_published":"2018-09-11 18:36:00","article_length":8234,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:17.621614","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/09\/climate-change-look-out-below\/569929\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A \u201cgreen vortex\u201d is saving America\u2019s climate future.\u00a0\u00a0 Here, at least, is the standard story: The past decade has been abysmal for climate-change policy in the United States. In 2009, a handsome new president took office pledging to pass a comprehensive climate bill in Congress. He did not. The Environmental Protection Agency sought to meaningfully reduce carbon pollution from power plants. It did not. The United States joined the Paris Agreement. Then we elected President Donald Trump, and we left. Yes\u2014and here, the narrator always inserts a gale-force sigh\u2014America knows what it needs to do: Pass a carbon fee or tax, some kind of policy that nudges people to reduce their use of fossil fuels. Yet America refuses. And so the 2010s, once greeted as a \u201cnew era\u201d for climate action, now seem unexceptional, the third decade in a row that the United States understood the dangers of climate change but failed to act. Meanwhile the seas rose, wildfires raged, and the Earth saw its hottest 10 years on record. You have probably heard this tale before; it is a popular and undeniably accurate read of recent history. It has just one flaw: America is decarbonizing anyway. That 2009 climate bill, the one that President Barack Obama couldn\u2019t pass? It required the U.S. to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 as compared with their all-time high. Yet last year, our emissions were down 21 percent . The same bill said that the U.S. had to generate 20 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. Last year, we met that target . We will surpass it in 2021. These numbers are not a mere fluke. Last year was a singular, awful moment in economic history, but even accounting for the effects of the COVID-19 recession, America\u2019s real-world emissions last decade outperformed the Obama bill\u2019s targets. From 2012 to 2020, real-world U.S. emissions were more than 1 billion tons below what the bill would have required, according to my analysis of data from Rhodium Group , an energy-research firm. (Of course, had the bill passed, the U.S. might have done even better.) Meanwhile, across the economy, companies are learning how to decarbonize. Ford is already producing more electric Mustang Mach-Es than gas-powered Mustangs; General Motors, Honda, Volvo, and Jaguar have promised to stop selling gas cars altogether by 2040. Royal Dutch Shell was court-ordered last month to cut its emissions, and shareholders just forced Exxon to replace a quarter of its board with climate-concerned activist investors. Most important of all, the costs of solar and batteries have declined in the United States by a factor of 10 over the past decade, and the cost of wind has fallen 70 percent. Ten years ago, virtually no analyst thought they would fall so low. The International Energy Agency made headlines this year when it called solar \u201cthe cheapest electricity in history,\u201d but the entire apparatus of renewable energy has seen cost declines. What gives? America is supposed to be doing nothing right. Yet we\u2019re making progress anyway. How? Why? A group of scholars, engineers, and economists may have an answer. Over the past few years, this group has puzzled together a powerful thesis that explains why America and the world are decarbonizing\u2014and how they can get better at it. Decarbonization isn\u2019t best accomplished by fiat, they argue, but by feedback loop; it proceeds by a self-accelerating process that I have called \u201cthe green vortex.\u201d The green vortex describes how policy, technology, business, and politics can all work together, lowering the cost of zero-carbon energy, building pro-climate coalitions, and speeding up humanity\u2019s ability to decarbonize. It has also already gotten results. The green vortex is what drove down the cost of wind and solar, what overturned Exxon\u2019s board, and what the Biden administration is banking on in its infrastructure plan. In the group\u2019s telling, the past decade might not be defined by \u201ca failure to have any sort of comprehensive climate policy,\u201d as Jesse Jenkins, an engineering professor at Princeton, told me, but by a \u201cpiecemeal, bottom-up investment and subsidy-led approach to driving emissions change.\u201d \u201cPolicy makers have been dithering about climate change since 1988, and in the background you have this steady progression of technologies,\u201d Greg Nemet, a public-affairs professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. Foreign industrial policy has driven that progression, he said, although American tax rebates\u2014and California\u2019s economic planning\u2014have also played a part. Those policies have allowed the entire world to decarbonize and led companies to support ever more aggressive carbon cuts. That, in essence, is the green vortex. In coining green vortex , I\u2019ve borrowed from the work of Nina Kelsey, an international-affairs professor at George Washington University, who has argued that combining financial incentives and technological change into a \u201cgreen spiral\u201d can drive decarbonization. \u201cThere\u2019s so much energy spent on trying to convince people what we should do about climate change,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think it\u2019s gone about as far as we can go.\u201d What will fix climate change now, she says, is making it profitable for companies to fight climate change. We should hope this thesis is correct. Under America\u2019s new Paris Agreement pledge, announced by President Joe Biden in April, the country will need to double the pace of its emissions decline over the next decade. Whatever we\u2019re doing right, we\u2019re soon going to have to do it twice as fast. So \u2026 you know \u2026 we\u2019d better figure out what it is. The idea that drives the green vortex is: Practice makes improvement. The more that we do something, whether baking a cake or manufacturing electric vehicles, the better we get at it. (Economists call this \u201clearning by doing.\u201d) This idea might seem intuitive, but it is often ignored in policy conversations. Over the past half decade, learning by doing has driven down the cost of semiconductors, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The green vortex leverages this idea to describe a positive feedback loop. Policy can speed up the pace of technology development. As technologies develop, they get cheaper. As they get cheaper, more companies adopt them. As more companies adopt them, their leaders grow more comfortable with climate policy generally\u2014and more supportive of pro-technology policy in particular. As more corporate leaders support climate policy, coalitions change, governments can pass more aggressive measures, and the cycle expands and begins again. The core mechanism here is that subsidies speed up learning by doing. Any industry would, eventually, figure out how to make a product more cheaply; subsidies move that learning forward in time, so that the unsubsidized price starts looking attractive more quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to grab the lever that accelerates the pace of cost declines,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the policy has teeth.\u201d The cycles of the vortex can start slow, but there is wide evidence for them. Nemet, the Wisconsin professor, pointed me to one case in particular. In the 1970s, amid a global surge in the price of oil, Denmark began to seed a homegrown wind industry. By the early \u201980s, this small country best known for its maritime culture and cheese-filled pastry found one of its largest markets in the U.S., when California began subsidizing large wind farms. By 1990, three-quarters of the world\u2019s installed wind capacity was in that one state. Cheap solar energy emerged from a similar global alignment, Nemet\u2019s work has shown, this one between Chinese factories and German tariffs in the early 2010s. But to harness the green vortex in order to make decarbonization cheap, the industries that adopt these technologies matter quite a bit. Kelsey, the GW professor, has thought carefully about this exact question. Generally, you can divide industries facing decarbonization into four broad categories, she told me. The first two are straightforward: There are winner industries and loser industries. So solar companies, on the whole, will prosper; coal-mining firms and traditional oil-and-gas companies will decline. But many, if not most, companies probably fall into a category that Kelsey calls \u201cresource managers\u201d: They will respond to climate policy chiefly by using less energy and fewer raw materials\u2014increasing their efficiency and decreasing their electricity use. Google, Nike, and Walmart are all arguably resource managers, as are most restaurants, hair salons, and doctors\u2019 offices. But a precious few industries\u2014some of the most important to the second story of American climate politics\u2014fit into a fourth box. Some companies look like losers; under their current business model, they stand to suffer from the energy transition as much as oil companies. But if they restructure their business and reimagine their products, then they would become winners, poised to dominate the future economy. Kelsey calls these the \u201cconvertible industries,\u201d and they anchor her scheme. In the American economy, she told me, two such industries tower above the rest: automakers and electric utilities. Both sell a product that contributes to climate change today but does not need to. Ninety-eight percent of light-duty vehicles sold in the United States in 2020 burned gasoline, but automakers could\u2014with some capital investment and reorganizing\u2014sell electric cars instead. The green vortex also makes Biden\u2019s climate and infrastructure agenda, the American Jobs Plan , fit into place. Large swaths of Biden\u2019s plan, which has been criticized for a lack of focus and unnecessary constraints , are devoted to beefing up industries. This choice makes more sense in light of the green vortex. It focuses much of its attention on industries that are crucial to decarbonization but that remain in their early stages. So it spends, for instance, $174 billion on \u201cwinning\u201d the global EV market, chiefly by building \u201cdomestic supply chains\u201d for electric vehicles and helping consumers buy specifically American-made vehicles. The Biden plan spends even more time on industries that don\u2019t yet have a plan to go zero-carbon. So it promises to invest in 15 industrial-scale demonstration projects to produce green hydrogen, and to create another 10 factories that will pioneer new ways to make zero-carbon steel, cement, and chemicals. And the plan promises that the federal government will buy such zero-carbon products to help fledgling firms. This focus on domestic production, on American-made cars and steel, runs against 40 years of textbook economics, which has prized efficiency above all. Herbert Stein, President Richard Nixon\u2019s chief economist, once declared that \u201cif the most efficient way for the U.S. to get steel is to produce tapes of [the TV show] Dallas and sell them to the Japanese, then producing tapes of Dallas is our basic industry.\u201d And it\u2019s true that fostering a domestic carbon-capture industry might suck up dollars that could go toward decarbonization elsewhere. But if you\u2019re trying to accelerate a vortex, it makes sense: Biden is betting that a strong domestic EV industry will build political demand for more decarbonization down the road. \u201cI feel a little weird looking at Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan, because I say, \u2018Well, you\u2019re doing everything I would tell you to do,\u2019\u201d Kelsey told me. Could a dynamic like the one these policy wonks and academics describe really save the world? According to Kelsey, it already has\u2014just not for climate change. The green vortex helped fix the fraying ozone layer in the 1980s, she argues, when it allowed for the global phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals, called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. \u201cThe most important thing, the underreported thing, is that the same companies that made the polluting CFCs also made the substitute for CFCs,\u201d she said. When major American chemical companies realized they could sell those new chemicals, called hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, to the same customers who once bought their CFCs, they lobbied a recalcitrant Reagan administration to support a global ozone pact. The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out use of CFCs, passed soon afterward. Then, when demand for HFCs wasn\u2019t as robust as those companies had projected, they pushed the U.S. and the world to toughen the Montreal Protocol. The agreement was tightened multiple times in the \u201990s and made stricter again in 2016 And that vortex has continued forward on its own strength. In the past decade, it has become clear that although HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, they do ravage the climate, trapping heat thousands of times more effectively than carbon dioxide. (Humanity, you might say, leapt from the atmospheric frying pan into the climatological deep-fat fryer.) Yet again, the U.S. has moved swiftly to address this problem. Last year, bipartisan majorities in Congress voted to keep phasing out the chemicals over the next 15 years, which will prevent the equivalent of 900 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than Germany\u2019s annual emissions. President Trump signed the phaseout, one of the most substantial pieces of climate policy in American history, into law on December 27. Why did Trump, no climate fan, approve the measure? Perhaps because it created another new market for those same chemical companies to sell a new type of replacement. Trump was, in other words, trapped in the green vortex. In the next decade, we\u2019ll find out if that feedback loop can work the same for decarbonization more broadly\u2014and whether American policy makers can learn not just to live in the green vortex, but to manipulate it.","headline":"How the U.S. Made Progress on Climate Change Without Ever Passing a Bill","article_name":619228.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/06\/climate-change-green-vortex-america\/619228\/","date_published":"2021-06-16 21:36:00","article_length":13631,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:18.016092","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/06\/climate-change-green-vortex-america\/619228\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Francis has been preparing an official text on the environment for over a year. An Italian newspaper leaked an early version of the document\u2014here\u2019s what\u2019s important to know. According to the Catholic Church, a number of acts qualify as mortal sins: murder, apostasy, stealing from the poor, etc. But in the eyes of a Vatican official who spoke to Bloomberg News on Monday, there\u2019s another kind of sin that qualifies as a \u201cheinous act\u201d: when a newspaper leaks a papal encyclical three days before it\u2019s supposed to come out. For more than a year, Pope Francis and his close advisors have been preparing this document, called Laudato Si , or Praised Be . The text focuses on environmental stewardship and, in particular, the effects of climate change on human life. The themes are directly in keeping with the rest of his papacy: When he was elected to the office, he told journalists he took the name \u201cFrancis\u201d in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, who stood for the poor and for peace, and was a \u201cman who loved and cared for creation ... in this moment we don\u2019t have such a great relationship with the creator.\u201d The official copy of the encyclical doesn\u2019t come out until Thursday, but on Monday, the Italian magazine L\u2019Espresso leaked an Italian version, which Church officials are calling a \u201cdraft.\u201d The Vatican has reacted so strongly to the leak because this encyclical is a very big deal within the Catholic world. It\u2019s one of the most formal statements the pope can make about Catholic doctrine, and it\u2019s the first of his papacy. (Last spring, he released another piece of writing on the topic of poverty, but it was a slightly less formal document called an apostolic exhortation.) Francis chose a theme that\u2019s long been a focus for pontiffs: Benedict XVI is cited 21 times in the draft version of the text, and John Paul II is cited 22 times. But this is the first instance in which the environment has been a topic of an encyclical. \u201cNo pope has ever issued a statement [about the environment] on this level of document,\u201d said Kevin Irwin, a priest and theologian who teaches at the Catholic University of America. \u201cJohn Paul put it into a World Day of Peace message, but a World Day of Peace message is down the rung on the ladder of the hierarchy of Catholic documents. And Benedict gave a number of homilies and speeches on it, but never a document on this level.\u201d In the draft version of the document, the pope makes a strong case that humans are at fault for the degradation of the environment. \u201cNumerous scientific studies indicate that the major part of global warming in recent decades is due to the high concentration of greenhouse gas \u2026 emitted above all because of human activity,\u201d he writes. His thinking on the environment connects with other major themes of his papacy, including care for the poor and the importance of human life. In the draft, he writes that the heaviest impacts of climate change \u201cwill probably fall in the coming decades on developing countries. Many poor people live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to heating, and their livelihoods strongly depend on natural reserves and so-called ecosystem services, such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.\u201d He also discusses the effects on immigrants and refugees: Changing environmental conditions force them into a position of economic uncertainty in which they can\u2019t sustain livelihoods, he writes. What this encyclical is not is a love letter to Greenpeace\u2014although Francis is embracing the idea of environmental stewardship, he's doing so as a Catholic theologian, not a liberal activist. Especially in the American press, the pope\u2019s encyclical has often been discussed in terms of U.S. politics, where a significant minority of mostly Republican voters and legislators deny the existence of climate change. Earlier this month, Oklahoma Sentor James Inhofe said of the encyclical , \u201cThe pope ought to stay with his job, and we\u2019ll stay with ours.\u201d Rick Santorum, a Catholic former U.S. senator and presidential candidate, advised the pope to \u201c[leave] science to the scientists and [focus] on what we\u2019re good at, which is theology and morality.\u201d But, in fact, the topic of this encyclical is squarely in the pope\u2019s wheelhouse. Francis links his call for environmental stewardship to the book of Genesis, and he repeatedly couches environmental degradation in theological language. \u201cThat human beings destroy the biological diversity in God's creation; that human beings compromise the integrity of the earth and contribute to climate change, stripping the earth of its natural forests or destroying its wetlands; that human beings pollute the water, soil, air; all these are sins,\u201d he writes. Although American Catholics are a sizable group, they\u2019ve got nothing on the whole of Francis\u2019s church: There are 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world, and nearly 40 percent of them live in South America, not North America. Sub-Saharan Africa is another area of rapid growth for the Church; demographers expect the number of Christians in the region to double by 2050 to nearly 1.1 billion, although some of those will be Protestants. Considering that Latin America and Africa are Francis\u2019s two biggest \u201cconstituencies,\u201d it\u2019s no wonder that the environment is a point of pressing concern for the global Church: Climate change affects those who are poor and live in developing countries much more intensely than those who live in the developed world. Francis is coming out against climate change, yes. But he\u2019s mostly continuing the focus of his entire papacy: speaking for the world\u2019s poor.","headline":"Why the Pope Is Blaming Climate Change on Humans","article_name":395915.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-climate-change-encylical-leaked-version\/395915\/","date_published":"2015-06-15 19:52:12","article_length":5592,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:18.959116","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-climate-change-encylical-leaked-version\/395915\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Guys, did you hear that a \"global warming\" expedition got trapped in ice and also\u00a0it's been pretty cold\u00a0recently? Yes, you did, because both stories have been used as a rationale to deny the existence of climate change. Guys, did you hear that a \"global warming\" expedition got trapped in ice and also it's been pretty cold recently? Yes, you did, because both stories have been used as a rationale to deny the existence of climate change, because people are disingenuous or misinformed or both. But, fine, let's explain it to them one more time. This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice For example, Donald Trump! Trump, a former reality television star, tweeted on Thursday morning that global warming is \"bullshit\" for the reasons you can see at right. Trump's previous environmental activism has been mostly focused on being mad at wind turbines that are interfering with a golf course he wants to build. Suffice it to say his foray into the broader sphere of environmental science has been equally dumb. But he's not alone. Deniers of global warming like Breitbert.com and Newsmax and a host on Fox Business and the Drudge Report have seized on the two occurrences to prove their point, or bolster their point, or just insult their opponents, whichever. Breitbart's John Hayward even wrote a poem about the ship, which was in the Antarctic to investigate sea ice levels. \"The water started getting cold \/ The frozen ship was stuck \/ Their theories called for melting ice \/ But they were out of luck... yes, they were out of luck\u2026\" Lol, etc. The Guardian  explains why this argument is incorrect. The Arctic, where sea ice melt has rapidly accelerated in recent years, is very different than ice in the Antarctic. There's no land, no continent in the Arctic, just ocean, which leads to a different pattern of melt than on Earth's southern pole. As the University of Tasmania's Tony Press told the paper, \"[Antarctica] is losing continental ice while sea ice has been increasing by about 1% a decade.\" This has been known for a long time. Oh, and the ship wasn't frozen in; it was trapped by shifting ice. How bad is Arctic ice melt? As The Hill  reports , Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is mad that the United States isn't moving faster to stake a claim in regions of the Arctic Circle that have become accessible due to warming temperatures. In 2012, a U.S. major general referred to the creation of a \"northern coast\" \u2014\u00a0that is, a new sea border for the continent as the Arctic opens up to sea travel. That is all thanks to global warming. Hayward didn't make up funny poems about it. But the much dumber argument is the one that it is cold therefore there is no global warming. As it turns out, it is winter. Even as temperatures warm, winter will still be colder. There will still be snow! It will just be wetter and in different places, and the cold nights will not be as cold on average . Take the mangrove trees in Matt Drudge's home state of Florida. They're suddenly being found further up the state's coast, thanks to a decreasing number of cold winter nights that would normally kill off the plants. New research suggests that the predicted increases in global temperatures have been underestimated , meaning that our expectations for what's to come are probably too optimistic. That's what the Drudge headline in the image above was linking to, but Drudge added the quotation marks, because who believes \"scientists\"? Losers.

{"id":null,"body":"Data featured in Al Gore's film turns out to be more complicated than simple graphs Two different climate change scientists at opposite ends of the political spectrum have backtracked on their positions in the last couple of days, indicating that Al Gore's method of simultaneously scaring and inspiring everybody with graphs, while effective, might not be sustainable. On Monday, Edward Wegman, the leading critic of that famous \"hockey stick\" graph, which shows a sharp uptick in atmospheric carbon dioxide in recent years (and which plays a key role in An Inconvenient Truth ), had his paper retracted because much of it was plagiarized. Then today Robert Socolow, who came up with those \"wedges\" that Gore uses at the end of his film to demonstrate that the problem is surmountable, said he regretted making the solution seem so simple . Those inspired by the theory took it farther. \u00a0If Socolow's wedges could stabilize emissions with a 3-degree rise, they said, even bigger wedges could actually bring greenhouse gases back down to a level resulting in only a 2-degree rise. (This is the goal that 140 nations have pledged to try to achieve in the Copenhagen Accord.) \"Our paper was outflanked by the left,\" Socolow said. \u00a0But he admits he did not protest enough: \"I never aligned myself with the 2-degree statement, but I never said it was too much.\"","headline":"Climate Change Scientists Face Inconvenient Truths","article_name":350776.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2011\/05\/climate-change-scientists-face-inconvenient-truths\/350776\/","date_published":"2011-05-17 19:24:32","article_length":1357,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:20.203116","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2011\/05\/climate-change-scientists-face-inconvenient-truths\/350776\/","source":"atlantic"}

And unless we all plan on getting used to an annual superstorm season, we should hope so. But here's a reminder, courtesy of a recent World Resources Institute report \u00a0on coal consumption,\u00a0that whatever the U.S. does to deal with climate change, our efforts will be for naught unless they're part of a global effort. Coal-fired power plants are the top contributor to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, and the future of coal will not be decided, by and large, in the United States, which consumed about 13 percent of the worldwide total in 2010. Instead, it's in the hands of China, which burned up 46 percent of it. China is also responsible for almost 40 percent of all the new coal-fired power plant capacity that's been planned across the planet. Beijing says it wants to cap its total consumption at about 3.9 billion tons by 2015, though some analysts expect it to reach around 4.2 billion -- a 27 percent leap from where it is today. Meanwhile, India is also readying to install huge quantities of coal power capacity. Unless something can be done to limit usage in these developing giants, their growth is going to eclipse any reasonable U.S. carbon reductions. This isn't an excuse for inaction here at home. If anything, taking steps to curb greenhouse gasses domestically would be a demonstration of good faith should the world's leaders ever try to hash out a new climate treaty.

{"id":null,"body":"The weather is nice, but it reminds us of the problems to come. This is not how February is supposed to feel. From D.C. to Denver , from Charlotte to Chicago , towns and cities across the United States have posted strings of record-breaking summery days in what is normally the final month of winter. Wednesday was only the third time since 1880 that Green Bay, Wisconsin, cracked 60 degrees Fahrenheit in February. Ice on the Great Lakes covers only a quarter of its normal surface area . And parts of Oklahoma and Texas have both already been scorched by 90-degree afternoons. All in all, the United States has already set more than 2,800 new record high temperatures this month. It has only set 27 record lows. Most people handle this weather as the gift it is: an opportunity to get outside, run or bike or play catch, and get an early jump on the spring. But for the two-thirds of Americans who are at least fairly worried about global warming , the weather can also prompt anxiety and unease. As one woman told the Chicago Tribune : \u201cIt\u2019s scary, that\u2019s my first thing. Because in all my life I\u2019ve never seen a February this warm.\u201d Or as one viral tweet put it: Me enjoying this weather but knowing our Earth is danger pic.twitter.com\/Jy6bINvZ6C If these feelings take the form of a question, it is something like: How much should we really be enjoying weather so unseasonal, so suggestive of the consequences of climate change, when we\u2019re doing so little to combat the larger phenomenon? If we think the future consequences of climate change will be very bad, are we allowed to savor them now? There is, of course, no single right answer to this query, and it is an ethical or existential concern as much as a scientific one. But when I posed it to the scientists who encounter climate change\u2019s consequences firsthand\u2014in the planet\u2019s expanding deserts, deluged coasts, and bleached coral reefs\u2014they said that it was fine to take the good with the bad when it came to upheavals in Earth\u2019s long-term climate. Katherine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University, told me that people shouldn\u2019t hesitate to enjoy unseasonably warm days, whether or not they are caused by climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of how all of the symptoms of a changing climate are not negative. And if there is something good, then enjoying it doesn\u2019t make [climate change] any better or worse than it would be otherwise,\u201d she said. Rather, the warm days might prepare people to notice other shifts in how they experience the weather. \u201cAs it gets warmer, the negative impacts outweigh the positive impacts,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will first look like hotter summers, pests moving northward, and our air-conditioning and water bill going up. Having these unusual days that we really notice, it makes us more aware of how other things are changing, too.\u201d For the climate-concerned, this is an encouraging theory of change\u2014and it fits with a body of research that suggests people experiencing unusual warmth are more likely to tell pollsters they believe in global warming. But a study published last year in Nature  should make advocates pause. It found that, for the vast majority of Americans, the weather became more favorable and pleasant from 1974 to 2013. Over all, winters have gotten generally warmer and more pleasant for \u201cvirtually all Americans,\u201d while summers have not yet become scorching and oppressively humid. This change has occurred on a shocking scale: On the \u201cpleasantness index\u201d used by the study, Boston in 2013 was as favorable as New York City was in 1976; and present-day St. Louis is nicer than D.C. or Baltimore four decades hence. This study stands apart from the rest of the climate literature for several reasons. It examines neither how climate change is shaping the weather\u2014it does not pull out a climate signal from the 40 years of weather change, only looking at weather overall\u2014and it does not treat the entire expanse of the country\u2019s land surface area equally. Rather, it wants to know how Americans experience the weather, so its analysis gives more weight to highly populated counties. The study also omits incidences of extreme weather. Those have increased during the study period , and they will be one of the earliest ways Americans in the Lower 48 experience the consequences of climate change. \u201cWhile we\u2019re hearing over and over again that climate change is something we should fear, most people are experiencing it in a way that\u2019s really quite comfortable,\u201d says Megan Mullin, a political scientist at Duke University and one of the authors of the study. \u201cWhat I take away from this is really a lesson for scientists. My Twitter stream is filled with these maps, over and over again, showing departures from historically average temperatures. In my mind, [that kind of messaging] is not going to motivate the public to treat this as a top priority.\u201d And their study also found that that motivation is needed now, because\u2014after the middle of the century\u2014climate change will begin to make summers worse: Under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions proceed at an unabated rate \u2026 we estimate that 88 percent of the U.S. public will experience weather at the end of the century that is less preferable than weather in the recent past. But this switch won\u2019t happen \u201cfor decades out,\u201d said Mullin. And by then it will be too late to adjust policies to meaningfully mitigate climate change. \u201cOnce we\u2019re past a certain point, then we can\u2019t just flip the switch and say, it\u2019s time to address it. What we have to do is start dealing with it now. Partly because of the way our climate system works, but also because of the way our policy system works,\u201d she told me. All this said, many Americans are already feeling the economic consequences of unseasonable warmth. For instance, peach trees require a certain number of chilling hours\u2014that is, exposure to weather below 45 degrees\u2014in order to produce a bountiful crop. Optimally, Georgia\u2019s peach-farming regions want to experience about 1,000 chilling hours before the arrival of spring. This year, according to the Macon Telegraph,  some farms have recorded as few as 470\u2014and they have little hope of seeing temperatures fall again before spring. This story has been repeated across the country for essentially any plant that requires some amount of wintertime chilling. \u201cThose of us who have office jobs and bike to work may be enjoying these temperatures, there are a large number of stakeholders in the agricultural community who see doom more clearly in them than we do,\u201d says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech. \u201cI know without a doubt that should such unseasonbly warm temperatures continue into the summer, we will see energy bills spike to astronomical levels, see older residents suffer, and see schoolchildren have to stay inside due to temperatures spiking past human thresholds,\u201d she added. And by the way, are the warm temperatures this month even attributable to the large-scale damage that climate change will wreak? Many climate scientists encouraged some humility. People shouldn\u2019t look to any one day\u2019s weather for confirmation that climate change exists, they said. Rather, Americans should look at the broader trends: specifically, the century-long, planet-wide warming trend , and the fact that eight of the last 10 years have been among the warmest on record. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that this week\u2019s warmth is caused by climate change, so I feel free to tell my colleagues to enjoy it,\u201d said Cobb. \u201cThe staggering and humbling and worrying moment as a scientist comes when we see that 2015 shattered the record for 2014, and 2016 shattered the record for 2015 .\u201d Mullin said that people should ultimately try to seek out better and more reliable sources than their personal experience of the weather. \u201cI think of weather as an indicator in the same way that I think about exposure to crime or exposure to unemployment,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf you know a bunch of people who have lost their jobs, you start to think unemployment is a substantial problem. And then when you start seeing coverage in the newspaper, you might not really know what a baseline level of unemployment is, or should be\u2014but that employment figure jumps out at you, because you know a bunch of people who have lost their jobs.\u201d \u201cIt makes sense that people use this information, but we should try really hard not to. Because it\u2019s not high-quality information,\u201d she said. Rather, we should trust the well-documented trends and studies that point to global warming\u2019s existence and urgency. And Katherine Hayhoe encouraged thinking about any one day\u2019s weather through a more nuanced lens. \u201cOn the science side, the number-one question often is: Is this global warming or not? I really am convinced that\u2019s completely the wrong question to ask,\u201d she told me. It was like, she said, asking if a heart problem is the result of genetics or lifestyle. \u201cFor most of us, the answer is both. And saying\u2014\u2018Is this heart attack caused by lifestyle or genetics?\u2019\u2014is pointless, because the answer will be both. We can\u2019t change the genetics of our natural weather patterns and variability, but we can change our lifestyle.\u201d And right now, our planetary lifestyle involves emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every second and slowly, but surely, warming the globe.","headline":"Is It Okay to Enjoy the Warm Winters of Climate Change?","article_name":517512.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/should-you-enjoy-the-warm-winters-of-climate-change\/517512\/","date_published":"2017-02-23 15:45:58","article_length":9351,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:21.527331","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/should-you-enjoy-the-warm-winters-of-climate-change\/517512\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Republicans have the ability to offer a market-based solution to climate change, so why aren\u2019t they doing it? William F. Buckley, widely considered the father of modern conservatism, once opined: \u201cConservatives pride themselves on resisting change, which is as it should be. But intelligent deference to tradition and stability can evolve into intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism, as when conservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort to raise their heads and reconsider is too great.\u201d A perfect illustration is the GOP\u2019s current stance on climate change\u2014an issue Buckley himself took seriously . In the face of overwhelming scientific consensus, today\u2019s Republican leaders either deny climate science outright or insist that any solution, as Marco Rubio recently claimed , \u201cwould have a devastating impact on our economy.\u201d This has relegated the GOP to playing defense at the moment that President Obama is turning climate mitigation into a central pillar of his legacy and heading to Paris to broker a global climate agreement. Republicans have backed themselves into a losing climate position that not only reflects poor science, poor economics, and poor strategy, but also betrays enduring conservative principles. The party of Theodore Roosevelt has forgotten that stewardship stands among its most noble traditions. As Russell Kirk, author of The Conservative Mind , put it: \u201cNothing is more conservative than conservation.\u201d It was Ronald Reagan, after all, who signed the Montreal Protocol, the most successful international environmental agreement to date. But \u00a0today\u2019s Republican leadership views stewardship as incompatible with free enterprise and limited government. This is a shame, as the conservative canon could offer America a better climate solution than Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan . So what would a conservative alternative look like? Naturally, it would be market-based. It would begin by fixing a widely known flaw of free markets: their tendency to produce negative externalities\u2014such as pollution\u2014as a result of not being factored into market pricing. The obvious remedy is a carbon tax, which economists of all stripes overwhelmingly favor. Recent advocates include Henry Paulson and Gregory Mankiw , respectively secretary of the treasury and chairman of the council of economic advisers under President George W. Bush. But what makes for good policy does not necessarily make for good politics. A carbon tax is usually considered a non-starter in the United States, both among the general public, to whom it sounds like all sticks and no carrots, and to the GOP, which views carbon taxes as a backdoor to larger government. This political calculus changes completely, however, if the money generated is returned to citizens in a revenue-neutral fashion. Two-thirds of Americans favor such an approach, according to a Stanford University\/RFF poll . The idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax is hardly new. My colleagues Clifford Cobb, Jonathan Rowe, and I wrote about this 20 years ago in an Atlantic cover story . What\u2019s new is that in 2008, the right-of center government in British Columbia introduced such a plan, and sufficient time has now passed to weigh the results . Fossil fuel use in British Columbia has since fallen by 16 percent, as compared to a 3 percent increase in the rest of Canada, and its economy has outperformed the rest of the country. So the benefits of this approach are no longer theoretical. The next question is how revenue generated from carbon taxes should be returned to the American people. The Alaska Permanent Fund , which pays out an annual dividend to all residents, and was first introduced by a Republican governor in a state known for its libertarian tendencies, provides a useful precedent. But unlike the Alaskan model, which derives its revenues from resource extraction and therefore encourages fossil fuel use, a climate dividend funded by a carbon tax would encourage the precise opposite: efficiency and cleaner energy. All citizens would suddenly have an economic stake in reducing greenhouse gases. There is no free lunch here, but rather a highly incentivized, \u00e0 la carte, one: The bigger your carbon footprint, the more you pay; the smaller your footprint, the more you benefit as all revenue raised would be distributed equally. So if, for example, you choose to drive a gas-guzzler, your costs will go up, but if you switch to a more efficient car or public transportation, you come out ahead. Each year, both the carbon tax and corresponding dividend would increase, until the country reaches a low carbon economy. Prominent Republicans such as former Secretary of State George Schultz and former Congressman Bob Inglis are already advocating such a plan\u2014which they call Fee and Dividend \u2014alongside liberals such as climatologist James Hansen. Meanwhile legislatures and citizens in states from Massachusetts to Washington are advancing their own versions of the idea, hinting at its bipartisan appeal. But the strategic upsides to Republicans may be the most intriguing. Chief among these is a climate solution fully consistent with the philosophy of limited government. The popularity of climate dividends would ensure that a carbon tax remains revenue neutral\u2014but the argument goes deeper. The logic of internalizing the environmental cost of carbon extends to pashing out all fossil fuel subsidies, which would shrink government. And over the longer term, as Paulson points out , \u201cpricing carbon\u2026 will reduce the role of government, which, on our present course, increasingly will be called on to help communities and regions affected by climate-related disasters.\u201d What of the fears that tackling climate change could cripple the economy? As British Columbia illustrates, recycling carbon revenues back into the economy yields the opposite. Bill Gates (another carbon tax advocate) , recently told The Atlantic that decarbonizing requires an unprecedented level of innovation. This so happens to be one of the main drivers of economic growth and higher living standards. Reinventing everything from transportation and energy infrastructure to homes and the appliances they contain will not only spur whole new industries, but also create vast numbers of jobs. This year, a REMI study found that pairing carbon taxes with climate dividends could generate 2.1 million new jobs in the United States over the next decade. Could a climate solution that upholds conservative principles overcome the current lock that fossil fuel and related interests have over the GOP? Judging from the Republican presidential primary, the answer is a resounding no. But more encouraging forces are at work beneath the surface. Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, is lobbying Republicans to propose a carbon tax in exchange for dismantling Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. A prominent GOP donor, Jay Faison, is spending $175 million to encourage Republican candidates to take climate change seriously. A number of Fortune 500 companies are voluntarily committing to carbon reductions. And grassroots groups like Young Conservatives For Energy Reform are gaining traction within the party. Add to that the moral weight of Pope Francis\u2019s much-publicized plea to honor our collective responsibility as stewards of the earth. Perhaps this explains the recent spike in the share of Republicans who acknowledge that climate change is occurring: from 47 percent to 59 percent in the latest University of Texas Austin poll , and from 47 percent to 56 percent in the latest University of Michigan one . Among younger Republicans and political independents \u2014two key swing groups\u2014support is considerably higher. Come the 2016 general elections, these numbers suggest that the Republican presidential nominee may well be cornered in an unpopular position for lack of a conservative climate solution. How, voters will increasingly ask, can the GOP claim to be the party of the future, without a plan to safeguard it?","headline":"What a Conservative Alternative to Obama's Climate Plan Looks Like ","article_name":415887.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/a-conservative-approach-to-addressing-climate-change\/415887\/","date_published":"2015-11-16 11:07:00","article_length":7996,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:22.387190","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/11\/a-conservative-approach-to-addressing-climate-change\/415887\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Scientists say that poorer countries will see devastating effects much sooner than richer ones. In 2013, the world spewed nearly 40 billion tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that the greenhouse gas will cause a slew of future problems, from rising sea levels to warmer worldwide temperatures. But also included in those worries are the economic costs of carbon dioxide emissions. Known as the \u201csocial cost of climate change,\u201d this measurement looks at the damage rising temperatures can create for human health and crop yields, and estimates the monetary cost of each ton of carbon waste. Right now the Obama administration pegs that number at $37 for every ton, but according to a new study, that price tag may be much lower than the actual cost. Researchers from Stanford University found that the current price of climate change is more likely six times as much, approximately $220 for every ton of carbon produced. Using a new model to calculate the number, the researchers took into account the economic damage that catastrophic climate events, like storms or crop loss, could pose to a country\u2019s GDP over time. \u201cIf climate change affects not only a country's economic output, but also its growth, then that has a permanent effect that accumulates over time,\u201d Frances Moore, co-author and environmental scientist, said . Their findings appeared Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change . The Stanford study, like many others that calculate the social cost of climate change , has several variables in need of further investigation, and may not be completely accurate some researchers point out. \u201cTo me, it just seems like it has to be an overestimate,\" said William Pizer from Duke University, to ClimateWire \u201cI just think this is another data point that someone needs to weigh as they're trying to figure out what the right social cost of carbon is.\u201d Although Pizer suggests that the $220 figure might be too high, the Stanford study corroborates many scientists\u2019 suspicions that the current $37 per ton figure used to shape emission regulations is indeed underestimated . Another intriguing aspect of this new model, however, is that it also incorporates the economy\u2019s ability to adapt to damage from climate changes and acknowledges that warming temperatures will economically affect high- and low-income countries differently. \"There have been many studies that suggest rich and poor countries will fare very differently when dealing with future climate change effects, and we wanted to explore that,\" co-author Delavane Diaz said. The researchers noted that because poor countries are on average hotter than rich countries and have less rigid infrastructure, they might suffer greater economic costs due to climate change. \u201cIf temperature affects economic growth rates, society could face much larger climate damages than previously thought\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThis would justify more stringent mitigation policy.\u201d","headline":"The Dangerous Underestimation of Climate Change's Cost","article_name":384517.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2015\/01\/calculating-the-dollar-value-of-climate-change\/384517\/","date_published":"2015-01-14 17:58:04","article_length":2972,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:22.700448","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2015\/01\/calculating-the-dollar-value-of-climate-change\/384517\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The climate-denier-skeptic-doubter debate has new life thanks to a change in the AP style guide. When Jim Inhofe threw a snowball on the floor of the Senate to protest the scientific consensus on climate change, was he being a climate denier? Or a climate skeptic? Or a climate doubter? The distinction may seem trivial, but to those active on both sides of the issue, the words matter. So much so that lawsuits have even been threatened over them. And an addition to the Associated Press Stylebook entry on \u201cglobal warming\u201d announced Tuesday has only inflamed the debate. In a release , the AP said this: \u201cOur guidance is to use climate change doubters or those who reject mainstream climate science and to avoid the use of skeptics or deniers .\u201d When the AP talks, journalists across the globe listen\u2014the agency\u2019s stylebook can dictate exactly what words and phrases are used in reporting on political debates. So right on cue, environmentalists and climate scientists jumped on the change. Here\u2019s how the Sierra Club reacted on Twitter: \"Also, please now refer to 'flat-earthers' as 'Sphere-thought-challenged.'\" Seriously, what the heck, AP? https:\/\/t.co\/4UdZOWiV8t \u201cIt's not like [Inhofe\u2019s] climate-change views are nuanced or well thought out. It's not as if he's found some fundamental flaw with climate science\u2014he just refuses to accept the vast body of existing scientific work,\u201d said Karthik Ganapathy of 350.org in an email. The concern for the Left is that \u201cdoubter\u201d carries a connotation of questioning or concern. But the science on climate change is objectively overwhelming\u201497 percent of the world\u2019s scientists agree that the climate is changing as a result of human activity and that its effects are being felt. The AP guidance for \u201cthose who reject mainstream climate science,\u201d then, would seem acceptable. But it\u2019s \u201cdoubter\u201d that has proved controversial. \u201cThose who are in denial of basic science, be it evolution or human-caused climate change, are in fact science-deniers,\u201d climate scientist Michael Mann told ThinkProgress . \u201cTo call them anything else, be it \u2018skeptic\u2019 or \u2018doubter,\u2019 is to grant an undeserved air of legitimacy to something that is simply not legitimate.\u201d Even the word \u201cskeptic\u201d has proved controversial. In an open letter last year, scientists and educators with the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry urged the media to stop conflating skepticism with a rejection of science. \u201cProper skepticism promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims,\u201d they wrote . \u201cIt is foundational to the scientific method. Denial, on the other hand, is the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration.\u201d Paul Fidalgo of the Center for Inquiry, which was behind the letter, said that \u201cdoubter\u201d fell in the same category by implying that there was some \u201cgenuine skepticism and inquiry.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t like Bigfoot or aliens, where we can debate. Climate change is a real-world problem going on right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we bestow deniers with legitimacy, it\u2019s bad for us as a species. It means we can\u2019t move forward on confronting the problem.\u201d Paul Colford, a spokesman for the AP, said the change was discussed \u201cat length\u201d and that the AP had \u201cdecided that the description we added to the entry was the most precise.\u201d But \u201cdenier\u201d has also proved controversial, something the AP cited in its release on the change. The word deliberately carries with it connotations of Holocaust denial. In an email, George C. Marshall Institute CEO William O\u2019Keefe said the word \"was intended to be pejorative and was seen that way.\" In April, the American Legislative Exchange Council, a right-leaning partnership of state lawmakers and corporations, threatened to sue activists over the term. In a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letters to some left-leaning groups, ALEC said that statements charging the group denied global warming were \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cfalse and misleading material.\u201d The debate over what word is appropriate is still ongoing. The  New York Times covered the debate in February and followed up with a May column by public-editor Margaret Sullivan. Society for Environmental Journalists executive director Beth Parke has said there\u2019s no \u201ccollective opinion or institutional stance\u201d among the member journalists but that the discussion is continuing. William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University who has questioned climate science, applauded the AP for the move, but said he was still happy to be called a skeptic. \"All real scientists should be skeptics,\" he said. But green groups want the harshest word possible to be lobbed against a community they say is harmfully standing in the way of progress on climate change. Democrats have\u00a0 sought repeatedly to put Republicans on record about climate-change science, associating a denial of science with other extreme positions. It's become a frequent talking point on the campaign trail, especially as many GOP presidential candidates have openly questioned humans' role in climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"Researchers are beginning to tease out the environmental factors that play a role in helping the virus to spread. Last year, a team of researchers made a surprising discovery: Aedis aegypti mosquitoes\u2014the species that spreads West Nile Virus, dengue, chickungunya and, most recently, Zika\u2014were living year-round in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C. In a paper published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , the researchers wrote that the mosquitoes had been living in the area since at least 2011, biting and reproducing in the summer months and likely riding out the winter underground. Previously, scientists had believed that the mosquitoes couldn\u2019t survive year-round anyplace north of South Carolina. While the D.C. population of A. aegypti isn\u2019t believed to carry Zika, its presence nevertheless came as a shock. And as the Zika epidemic continues to spread through Brazil, Central America, and now the United States, scientists will continue to wrestle with how environmental factors like climate change are affecting the creatures that spread infectious diseases. Before last year, Zika outbreaks had appeared in sporadic small outbreaks near the equator in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. In May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization confirmed the first cases of Zika in Brazil; since then, the virus has spread rapidly throughout the Americas, including the first cases of Zika in the U.S. A student in Virginia contracted the virus while traveling in Central America, and public-health officials identified a case of sexual transmission in Texas . The World Health Organization recently declared Zika a public-health emergency , which means that controlling the epidemic \u201crequires a coordinated international response,\u201d said Kathryn Jacobsen, a professor of global health at George Mason University. The designation of \u201cpublic-health emergency,\u201d she explained, allows the WHO to designate additional resources for researching the virus, tracking its spread, and developing programs to prevent and control the disease. Zika, named for a forest in Uganda, is a flavivirus, a type of virus that mutates frequently. Scientists believe a new mutation to the Zika virus may explain the emergence of birth defects and other side effects not seen in past outbreaks. (Researchers strongly suspect a link between Zika infection in pregnant mothers and babies born with unusually small heads and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.) Flavivurses are also typically spread through animal vectors. Zika\u2019s vector, the A. aegypti mosquito, is found in warm, humid areas in Central and South America, Mexico, and the Southeastern United States (among others). Most people have a rough sketch of these mosquitos\u2019 life cycles and dietary habits: They are known to reproduce in standing water. Bites from the female, which feeds on human and animal blood, are the primary mechanism of Zika\u2019s spread (although the Texas case, so far the only case to be communicated in the United States, \u00a0has made sexual transmission a concern as well). And like other viruses spread by mosquitos and ticks, Zika could soon enjoy a greater reach, thanks to climate change. Last year, a team of researchers mapped the global distribution of Aedes mosquitos to better understand the global human-health risk, noting that the mosquitos are more widely distributed than ever before. In 2005, Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical School published an influential paper on climate change and human health, outlining mosquitoes\u2019 sensitivity to temperature changes. \u201cWarming of their environment\u2014within their viable range\u2014boosts their rates of reproduction and the number of blood meals they take, prolongs their breeding season, and shortens the maturation period for the microbes they disperse,\u201d he wrote. In other words, they bite more, breed more, and spread more disease. But exactly how climate change drives the spread of Zika and other diseases is hard to define. In 2013, researchers at the University of Arizona published a paper examining the effect of climate factors on dengue and its Aedes vectors. Their conclusion highlighted just how far scientists still have to go in understanding the climate-disease link: \u201cClimate influences dengue ecology by affecting vector dynamics, agent development, and mosquito\/human interactions,\u201d they wrote, but \u201calthough these relationships are known, the impact climate change will have on transmission is unclear.\u201d Climate change introduces additional complications into an already complex system, the study authors explained: It\u2019s difficult enough to understand how weather, climate, human interaction, or mosquito behavior contribute to the spread of a virus. Assembling those pieces to create even the vaguest picture of how a virus will act weeks, years, or decades from now is a herculean analytical task. The WHO identifies environmental changes \u2014climate change chief among them\u2014as hazards to human health, and the populations most vulnerable to climate-related health issues tend to live in populations that lack a robust public-health infrastructure. One WHO publication predicts that warming of two to three degrees Celsius would put up to 7 percent more people\u2014several hundred million globally\u2014at risk of malaria, another mosquito-borne disease. \u201cZika showing up in the Americas is probably more a function of international travel and trade than of climate change. But now that the virus has started circulating in the Americas, both climate factors and human behavior will play a role in where it spreads,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cChanges in temperature, precipitation, and humidity can alter how long the mosquitoes live, how often they bite, how many offspring they have, and how quickly a virus reproduces inside an infected mosquito, and each of those changes can mean more humans are exposed to mosquitoes.\u201d The concern extends beyond public-health organizations\u2014on a more immediate level, primary-care physicians are also taking notice of climate change as a health concern. \u201cI\u2019ve done several surveys of physicians and asked them whether they think climate change is relevant to direct care of patients,\u201d Mona Sarfaty, the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Climate Change Communication, told me.\u201cTwo-thirds say yes. It\u2019s definitely relevant to patient care.\u201d In 2011, the American Medical Association published an editorial arguing the same thing. As WHO devotes more resources to understanding Zika, therefore, it may make sense to incorporate research on climate. \u201cThere is a general need for more studies of the linkages between ecological health, animal health, and human health,\u201d Serfaty said, \u201cin addition to the very specific and urgent need to learn more about Zika virus.\u201d","headline":"The Link Between Zika and Climate Change","article_name":470643.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2016\/02\/zika-and-climate-change\/470643\/","date_published":"2016-02-24 14:00:00","article_length":6794,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:24.015713","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2016\/02\/zika-and-climate-change\/470643\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Geo-engineering won\u2019t hurt a bit, at least compared with climate change\u2014and it deserves serious investigation, according to the authors of a recent study. The year is 2055, and climate change has fully set in. Months-long heat waves regularly kill infants and the elderly , and food shortages are testing governments on every continent. While the world is finally reducing its carbon emissions, the cuts aren\u2019t happening fast enough, and scientists say Earth will keep rapidly warming for at least another century. To stave off a crisis, China and the United States jointly propose an audacious scheme: They will inject sulfate aerosols into the high atmosphere to dim the sun\u2019s rays, as happens naturally after a huge volcanic eruption. The two countries say the plan will restore order and lower the planet\u2019s fever. But critics assert that the aerosols will distort the planet\u2019s climate even further, weakening the monsoon and setting off droughts across Asia and Africa. The scenario may sound like science fiction, but the debate over the prudence of this technique\u2014called solar geo-engineering\u2014has already begun. On Monday, a new paper from a team of researchers claimed that it is possible to dim the sky in such a way that no region of the planet will be made significantly worse. No major land area will face more intense temperature, precipitation, or drought extremes under a specific solar geo-engineering scenario than would occur instead under climate change, the paper asserts. Read: What happens if we start solar geo-engineering\u2014and then suddenly stop? \u201cThat\u2019s stunning. If it\u2019s really true, it\u2019s a huge deal,\u201d says David Keith , an author of the paper and a professor of applied physics at Harvard. The study, which relies on a relatively rosy and moderate geo-engineering scenario, was co-authored by several widely recognized climate scientists who had never published on the topic before: Kerry Emanuel , an MIT professor who specializes in tropical cyclones, and Gabriel Vecchi , a geoscience professor at Princeton. Keith believes that these optimistic early results should justify the establishment of a new international research program on solar geo-engineering. Yet the paper, published in Nature Climate Change , has already been criticized by those who worry that geo-engineering researchers are moving too fast and overselling the still-notional technology. They also fret that optimistic talk of geo-engineering could discourage the public from embracing emissions cuts. \u201cThey are desperately trying to conjure demand for their research topic, but I think they\u2019re hamstringing themselves over the long term by overclaiming,\u201d said Jane Flegal, a climate-policy researcher and an adjunct faculty member at Arizona State University, in a message. She worried that the study\u2019s cheerful conclusion downplays the chance that geo-engineering will require economic or political trade-offs. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is correct to imply that geo-engineering is a good or safe idea,\u201d said Alan Robock , a professor of environmental sciences at Rutgers, in an email. He questioned how the study used computer climate models\u2014that is, its authors did not simulate solar geo-engineering by modeling volcanic aerosols in the high atmosphere. Instead, they told the computer model to reduce the strength of the sun\u2019s rays, a sort of brute-force proxy for geo-engineering. \u201cAnd there is no way to do what they modeled, as we cannot turn down the sun,\u201d Robock said. Keith and his colleagues acknowledge some of these criticisms in the paper. Simulating geo-engineering by turning down the sun in models is \u201ca very widely used technique,\u201d he told me. It allows easier comparison between different computer models that may use varying processes to simulate high-atmospheric aerosols. The new paper does not investigate whether solar geo-engineering could restore the climate to pre-global-warming levels. (Right now, the only way to avoid climate change altogether is to cut emissions. ) The new paper asks instead whether geo-engineering could essentially cut the dangers of climate change in half. It uses high-resolution climate models , including one developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to compare two different scenarios: one where atmospheric carbon levels have doubled above preindustrial levels and geo-engineering is not used, and another where they have doubled, but geo-engineering is used. In every region of the world, the study found, temperatures grew less extreme with geo-engineering. And while geo-engineering disturbed the climate of some regions in new but small ways, it overall reduced the effects of climate change in places it was worst. \u201cThose regions experiencing the greatest climate change are the most likely to see it reduced by [solar geo-engineering],\u201d the study says. There are many asterisks here. The study focuses on very vast regions: One of its areas encompasses the entire Pacific coast of South America; another includes almost all of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. It also does not study the lines on the planet that may matter far more: national borders. Even if rainfall remained constant in each of the studied regions, it could still cause conflict by shifting from one country to another, disrupting agriculture and water supplies. The study cannot examine that possibility. The study also examines a form of unadulterated climate change that will likely be easier than what we are on track for: It uses a scenario that assumes carbon-dioxide levels will sit at about 560 parts per million , but even some moderate scenarios assume they will pass that point in the middle of the century . (The absolute worst-case scenario projects 1370 parts per million by 2100.) \u201cI am not saying that we know solar geo-engineering reduces risk,\u201d Keith said. He acknowledged that the paper presents idealized risks, and those may be wrong. But the paper also, he said, makes \u201cthe most important case that solar geo-engineering could be really useful.\u201d Read: Should we dim the skies to save the world? \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that this study actually tells us very little about the feasibility of the idea of geo-engineering,\u201d Flegal said. \u201cIt is reasonable to ask whether we expect the real world to behave like these models. [And] even if the real world behaved like these models, it is not clear to me that we should expect that this research will inform \u2018rational\u2019 decision making in this domain.\u201d \u201cPeople\u2019s experience of climate is not entirely driven by physical climate variables,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is mediated by all sorts of other cultural, political, social, and economic factors.\u201d In other words, even if solar geo-engineering didn\u2019t cause a particularly bad weather outcome, people may still blame it. While scientists have long hypothesized about the role of solar geo-engineering, serious researchers avoided the topic for all of the 20th century. That changed 13 years ago, when the Dutch chemist Paul Crutzen, a recipient of the Nobel Prize, called for a new program of \u201cactive scientific research\u201d into the technique . Since then, governments and philanthropists have begun funding programs on the topic . \u201cThere\u2019s much more interest among really senior science-policy leaders than there used to be,\u201d said Keith. In 2017, during President Barack Obama\u2019s final days in office, the White House proposed a multiyear, comprehensive investigation into the topic. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine also recently formed a committee to study it. But the topic has not yet been subject to widespread study across many institutions. It also poses a dilemma for environmental organizations. While some major green groups have tepidly endorsed geo-engineering research , a tweet-length endorsement of the technology by President Donald Trump\u2014or any antagonistic leader using it as an excuse to avoid cutting emissions\u2014would immediately force them to retract their support. \u201cSolar geo-engineering has been fairly critiqued as this clique,\u201d Keith said. Only a small number of scientists have spent time on the topic, \u201cand I\u2019m one of them. People could easily write this off and say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s Keith, so he knows the answer before we start.\u2019\u201d This is why he was so pleased that Vecchi and Emanuel also worked on the study. In Keith\u2019s view, more researchers of their caliber should be involved in geo-engineering research. \u201cWe need to get beyond a few researchers doing this as a hobby, which is what\u2019s happening now, and move to a serious international program with democratic controls and open-access research,\u201d he said. And he was clear: The results don\u2019t yet justify actually trying out solar geo-engineering on the planet. \u201cDeployment would be ridiculous,\u201d he said. It would also be impossible; there is still no way to seed sulfate into the high atmosphere. Robock, who is skeptical of the approach , said that some proposals to do so could cost $50 billion to $200 billion a year. \u201cEverybody wants to leap to an answer, \u2018Should we do it or not?\u2019 But we need some humility,\u201d said Keith, who is 55. \u201cOur generation, people my age, are not making this decision. It\u2019s going to be our kids, maybe in 20 years, who make a serious decision about solar geo-engineering. We can\u2019t bind their hands one way or another. And if we maintain the existing taboo and have no research on it, they\u2019ll still have to make decisions.\u201d","headline":"The Very Optimistic New Argument for Dimming the Sky","article_name":584551.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/solar-geo-engineering-may-bring-only-benefits-harvard-study-claims\/584551\/","date_published":"2019-03-12 15:19:01","article_length":9419,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:24.576329","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/solar-geo-engineering-may-bring-only-benefits-harvard-study-claims\/584551\/","source":"atlantic"}

And the only technologically proven way to keep them at bay is to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions,\u201d Meyer wrote. Climate change has been described \u00a0as \u201c a classic collective action problem in response to overexploitation of a global commons \u201d \u2014 the commons, in this case, being the atmosphere\u2019s capacity to buffer the huge amounts of carbon dioxide that human beings are sending into the sky. The world\u2019s nations have struggled to agree on how to fairly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, coming up with agreements that don\u2019t match the scale of the problem. At the same time, climate change has often been framed as a global problem, one that can only be solved by global action. The charismatic mascot of climate change is the polar bear, an animal that the vast majority of residents of earth will never encounter. Individual people experience the effects of climate change within their local communities. \u201cClimate and its changes might not only be observed in relation to landscape but also felt, sensed, apprehended emotionally, passing noticed and unnoticed as part of the fabric of everyday life in which acceptance, denial, resignation and action co-exist,\u201d wrote geographers Catherine Brace and Hilary Geoghegan of the University of Exeter . Anthropologists have begun to study how climate change weaves into the \u201cfabric of everyday life\u201d in different places. In Jinja, Uganda, a town experiencing environmental and economic decline, shifting weather patterns were seen as another sign that \u201c everything is becoming worse. \u201d A multinational set of students in Melbourne adopted a variety of strategies for staying cool in the city\u2019s extreme heat. People living in smaller islands in Micronesia can draw on centuries-old links with larger islands to escape rising seas. In Guyana, local and expert knowledge clashed and hybridized in the creation of a protective mangrove forest, a climate variation on a international development pattern. Here in California, in the wealthy tech-heavy region of the Bay, the fires offer a glimpse of an emerging form of disaster capitalism . Climate adaptation could look like a million individual products, each precisely targeted on social media to the intersection of a consumer culture and a catastrophe. As the environment weirds, people can reinterpret the problem as a personal, consumer one: \u201cWhat do I need to survive the biosphere today?\u201d For the wildfire smoke, there\u2019s the panoply of masks, from the Training Mask tapering down to simple paper masks, which don\u2019t work , but make you feel like you\u2019re doing something.

{"id":null,"body":"Surprising new polling data shows swing voters are going green. It was quite the messaging turnaround. In his September 6 acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, President Obama -- whose reticence about so much as mentioning global warming has flummoxed environmental activists -- used the subject to launch an unexpected attack on his opponent. \"Climate change is not a hoax,\" the president declared. \"More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future.\" In the after-speech gabfest, Politico  cited the moment as one of Obama's top applause lines. Obama's shift comes as pollsters and strategists are increasingly saying that Democrats -- and even perhaps some Republicans -- could be using the climate issue to their political advantage, especially after a summer of drought, wildfires, and record heat. Ever since the collapse of cap and trade, it's been \"strong conventional wisdom, even within major environmental organizations, that it can hurt us to talk about climate change,\" explains climate strategist Betsy Taylor, whose consulting firm Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions just released a new report on the subject. \"And I think that was a mistake.\" Recent polling data make clear, however, that extreme weather is leaving Americans increasingly worried about climate change. A mid July survey from the University of Texas at Austin, for instance, found that 70 percent of the public thought climate change was happening, an increase from 65 percent in March. What's more, a series of public opinion reports and analyses -- some based on data collected prior to the record heat waves of the summer, which suggests the public is even more alarmed now than when those surveys reached them -- have indicated that global warming is a potential political winner, rather than an electoral albatross.The conventional wisdom that activists like Taylor want to upset emerged following the 2008 economic collapse--when many climate advocates were painted as wannabe energy taxers , and a sharp contrast was drawn between helping the economy and helping the climate. Then came \"Climategate,\" a pseudo-scandal which has since been debunked , but which planted the idea that climate scientists had made up results to scare the public, and weakened Americans' concern about global warming Upshot: In the 2010 congressional elections, a number of Democrats who'd voted for cap-and-trade were picked off by Republican challengers. The most prominent victim: Virginia's Rick Boucher, a 14-term Congressional vet who lost to a Tea Party opponent who'd pilloried his pro-cap-and-trade vote. Moderate Republicans known for taking climate change seriously, like former South Carolina Rep. Bob Ingliss, were also sent packing . The first of these studies emerged in 2011 from Stanford pollster Jon Krosnick and his colleagues. The researchers conducted a survey in which respondents were broken into three groups, and then asked to support a hypothetical Senate candidate who either (1) denied the science of global warming and attacked cap and trade, (2) accepted the science and called for action, or (3) took no position on the issue. The result was clear: 77 percent of respondents supported the \"green\" candidate, 65 percent the neutral candidate, and only 48 percent the denier candidate. Both Democrats and independents strongly favored a green candidate over a neutral one, while for Republicans it was basically a wash -- neither a pro or anti-climate candidate moved them much. \"By taking a green position on climate, candidates of either party can gain votes,\" Krosnick's team concluded. Their findings were reinforced earlier this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason who, in a March 2012 survey, similarly found that taking a stand on climate has the potential to motivate Democratic and independent voters, without causing damage among Republicans. For instance, 82 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Independents agreed that the U.S. should undertake an either medium or large scale effort to cut down global warming. The implication, explains Edward Maibach of the George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication, is \"so different from what seems to be the wisdom of politicos, which is that this is a third rail of politics and you don't touch it.\" The reason, he explains, is that \"Independents respond more like Democrats than like Republicans\" on the issue -- giving climate advocates a potentially larger base of support. For example: 72 percent of Democrats in the study, as well as 66 percent of Independents, agreed that global warming would harm \"future generations\" either a moderate amount or a great deal. But perhaps most striking is Taylor's recently released report , which draws on a survey designed by Harstad Strategic Research pollster Andrew Maxfield, who previously did polling for President Obama's 2008 campaign. In a survey of 1,204 likely voters in May of 2012, Maxfield found that a \"clean energy\" candidate fared better than an \"all-of-the-above\" candidate who supported a variety of energy choices -- coal, drilling, and also clean energy. Maxfield then went on to test a variety of climate messages -- and the upshot, he says, is that \"if you feel strongly about climate change, there is a way to talk about it that voters will understand and appreciate\" -- especially if candidates focus on recent extreme weather. \"I was surprised at the strength of that, and the extent to which voters had begun to recognize the severe weather, and experience it,\" Maxfield says. It helps that climate scientists themselves are increasingly outspoken about explaining that global warming is shifting the odds in favor of more heat waves, severe storms, and other weather extremes -- even if no single, isolated event can be laid at the feet of global warming. Another set of messages Maxfield tested involve oil companies, which people perceive as having too much power. \"They know that oil companies command undue influence,\" and \"have rigged the system in many ways,\" says Maxfield. He and Taylor advise emphasizing \"patriotic pride\": America can come up with climate solutions -- it can \"rise to the challenge and succeed.\" Such messaging, they suggest, can appeal to a \"solid majority of voters.\" What's perhaps most fascinating is that all three studies discussed aboveare based on public opinion data gathered prior to the summer of 2012, when record heat and freak storms drove up public belief in global warming. The Yale and George Mason group just conducted another more recent poll , this one on likely but undecided voters in the 2012 election. Not only do most undecideds think global warming is happening and caused by humans, but 61 percent say it will be an important issue in determining who they vote for. To be sure, none of the pollsters or strategists are saying that climate change will be a winning issue across the board. There are good ways and bad ways for politicians to communicate about climate, explains Paul Bledsoe, a Washington-based consultant who was the chief staffer on climate change communications in the Clinton White House. \"When it is isolated from the things they care about, people tend to react more negatively, especially if they feel they're being lectured about it, because they often feel there's little they can do about it,\" says Bledsoe. Rather, he explains, a climate message will resonate with voters if it is made \"relevant to their livelihoods, experiences in their states and localities.\" In other words, it is not that any type of climate communication is a guaranteed win--just that it is far from a guaranteed loser. But that still leaves a growing disconnect between politicians' fear of the climate issue on the one hand, and emerging public opinion data on the other. \"Democrats don't need to be as afraid of this issue as they are,\" says Maxfield. From President Obama on down, if candidates who talk about climate change win in 2012, expect that situation to rapidly change.","headline":"Is Climate Change the Sleeper Issue of the 2012 Election?

{"id":null,"body":"Experts say mounting environmental pressures will make people sicker, and that the health-care system will play a major role in averting disaster. C limate change can seem almost too big to fathom. Reports such as the recent National Climate Assessment and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s recent release have made waves by portraying the dire threats of a warming world, making the case that the fundamental fabric of humanity will be degraded without immediate action. But the scenarios\u2014the biblical floods and droughts, the mass migrations of dispossessed people, the creeping seas and the retreating glaciers\u2014have a way of short-circuiting the brain. It\u2019s almost easier to despair or to will oneself into ignorance than to begin to grapple with the future. What are human lives when measured against the coming tempest? Efforts to assess the exact human costs of climate change, however, have provided new tools for understanding the ways in which those lives will be impacted. A major report published November 28 in the public-health journal The Lancet provides predictions of how climate change is degrading human health, and how it will alter health-care systems in the future. The findings are reliably grim. But in focusing on the health-care implications and the potential damage done to people and their descendants, the report provides a firm backing to the call to climate action. The experts behind the report hope to marry the urgency of climate science with the muscle of America\u2019s most successful and most trusted policy experiment\u2014its public-health system. The report, sponsored by 27 academic institutions, a collection of intergovernmental agencies, and the UN, features an American Public Health Association\u2013sponsored supplement dedicated to the specific effects of climate change on America. The authors Renee Salas, Paige Knappenberger, and Jeremy Hess examine what they propose are the three main ways in which a warming world will affect the health of Americans. For one, the heat itself and the increased intensity and duration of heat waves will make people sick, along with exacerbating existing conditions and reducing the productivity of workers. Second, as has been demonstrated in recent disasters, the rising severity and frequency of extreme weather events will elevate threats to health, as well as threats to health systems. Third, warmer seasons and warmer water mean the range for illnesses carried by ticks and mosquitoes will expand, putting more Americans in the crosshairs of diseases such as vibrio, Lyme disease, and West Nile. T he actual \u201cwarming\u201d of global warming is an issue that is often curiously overlooked in terms of its direct effects on human lives. But as The Lancet \u2019s report shows, it\u2019s the most predictable component of a changing climate, and also the one with measurable effects already. The report points to evidence already indicating links between hotter temperatures and mental-health and cognitive issues; increases in kidney diseases, preterm births, and respiratory diseases; heat exhaustion; and the advance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One estimate cited in the report finds that more than 3,000 additional people across the country will die prematurely because of higher temperatures by 2050. Released just days after the catastrophic fires that burned Paradise, California, were contained, The Lancet \u2019s paper also studies the effects of extreme weather events on health. \u201cSince 1980, there has been a steady rise in billion-dollar weather and climate disaster in the U.S.,\u201d the authors write, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But that finding doesn\u2019t quite capture how much more common extreme events have become, or how much their magnitude has increased in a short time. In 1984, there were two weather events that exceeded $1 billion of damage in today\u2019s dollars, with a five-year average of about $40 billion a year in costs from extreme events. In 2017, there were 16 such events, with a five-year average north of $200 billion in annual costs. With each of those events comes both direct risks to human lives and indirect risks associated with the collapse of health-care services and the spread of infectious diseases\u2014consequences that were already highlighted in the deaths of thousands of people in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. \u201cPerhaps one of the most startling facts is that we truly have climate refugees within the United States,\u201d Salas said in a conference call before the brief\u2019s release. \u201cI think that this is something that a lot of individuals within the U.S. think is a distant effect, but it\u2019s truly something that we\u2019re seeing here today. In fact, earlier this year I had a patient who came from Puerto Rico. She was elderly, she showed up with her luggage, and truly had a bag with medications that she hadn\u2019t taken in a few weeks \u2026 She was truly a climate refugee.\u201d And, as Salas notes, the most vulnerable populations to a whole range of health problems are those that have been recently displaced. As has emerged recently in studies of disaster-affected communities , they also suffer post-traumatic stress and a uniquely high mental-health burden that can persist for years. It\u2019s no wonder that displacement and the long-term effects of disasters are also wrapped up with spikes in diseases carried by mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas, and those transmitted by pathogens in warm water. In tropical Puerto Rico, Zika outbreaks before the storm led to fears of even greater outbreaks after the storm. But on the more temperate mainland, the real risk is the spread of subtropical diseases to places where temperatures were once too cold to support the diseases. The Lancet \u2019s report cites another from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that shows that disease cases from mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas more than tripled from just under 30,000 to almost 100,000 a year from 2004 to 2016, and also highlights a steady increase in the viability of vibrio, a bacteria found in warm waters that can cause life-threatening infections of gastroenteritis. According to Gina McCarthy, the director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment and a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, the increased geographic spread of these diseases can reverse the signature gains of the past century of American health policy\u2014namely, the near-eradication of many of the communicable infectious fever diseases that have always haunted humanity. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing challenges as broad as Massachusetts, where you\u2019re seeing that West Nile virus is increasing,\u201d she said on the conference call, \u201cor Lyme disease, because of species of mosquito that are spreading diseases that we weren\u2019t familiar with years ago, that are now becoming commonplace.\u201d I n a forum by the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Harvard Global Health Institute discussing The Lancet \u2019s global report and its brief for the United States, the authors and several public-health experts stressed to me that these findings were only the tip of the iceberg of some truly unforeseen future effects, that they were only examples of larger global trends, and that they don\u2019t reflect far-off future scenarios but rather what is currently observable in existing climate change. \u201cIn recent years, we have understood the importance of heat and climate change on the impacts of farmworkers who are working outdoors in some of the most difficult conditions just so Americans can have food to eat,\u201d said Jeannie Economos, the pesticide-safety and environmental-health project coordinator at the Farmworker Association of Florida. In a study that the association conducted with Emory University researchers, Economos told me that they found that more than 50 percent of farmworkers start each day dehydrated, and that after long days in the sun, a tenth of them can reach body temperatures of more than 101 degrees, which is in the danger zone for heat stroke. At that forum, with experts who were fluent in both climate and health, with perhaps more M.D.s on display than Ph.D.s, it was made clear that climate change and health care cannot be considered as separate domains. Rather, just as environmental stresses such as pollen and pollutants are key components of public-health initiatives, so the effects of a warming world must first be concerns for doctors and public-health officials working to create healthy communities. On the one hand, these are not necessarily conversations that physicians are primed for. On the other, people generally trust their doctors, and America\u2019s public-health system has provided the muscle for some of the most ambitious breakthroughs in terms of quality of life in the country\u2019s history. With the realization that climate change will have serious and perhaps devastating effects on human health over the next century also comes the realization that it can be addressed as a public-health problem, and combatted with the same kinds of interventions that have proven effective in fighting tobacco use and drunk driving. According to Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the APHA, \u201cOne of the central challenges that we do have is trying to encourage people that climate change is here today and is impacting our health today.\u201d While polls do indicate that most Americans believe the climate is changing, and that it is caused by anthropogenic actions, there\u2019s still a disconnect between that knowledge and informing the public of the tangible risks to their and their children\u2019s lives. Additionally, public-health models currently stress the importance of enduring racial and class health disparities, which Benjamin thinks will only be made doubly worse by the effects of climate change, which will also likely affect vulnerable populations first . How can policy makers make people care about health problems that may be disproportionately affecting people who don\u2019t look like them\u2014in a country where bigotry is rampant and encouraged at the highest levels? These are the points of consideration as a scientific movement at the intersection of climate change and public health truly begins to take off. The major debates at that intersection are no longer about whether the climate is changing, but the roles people should play in addressing it, who will be harmed, and how. For Benjamin, the role for the medical community is clear: \u201cThe way I think about it is: Somebody was made sick yesterday from climate change, someone is being made sick today as we speak, and someone is going to be made sick from climate change tomorrow.\u201d","headline":"How Climate Change Is Challenging American Health Care","article_name":577477.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2018\/12\/lancet-study-says-global-warming-threatens-public-health\/577477\/","date_published":"2018-12-06 13:00:00","article_length":10699,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:25.307730","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2018\/12\/lancet-study-says-global-warming-threatens-public-health\/577477\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Facing sea-level rise, flooding, and landslides, the city\u2019s residents are finding resilience\u2014because they have little other choice. R ain had been falling for several hours on the night of July 18, 2021, when the Tiwaris called their relatives and told them to evacuate their house. The Tiwaris live in suburban Mumbai, in the hillside shantytown of Surya Nagar, and their relatives were perched in one of a row of single-room tenements atop the steep terrain. Some of those homes had collapsed in a landslide two years earlier and had been recently rebuilt. Now, as the rain thundered on, the Tiwaris began to worry. Suddenly, the slope disintegrated into a torrent of mud and rock, the sound of the slide drowned out by the heavy rain. Before the Tiwaris\u2019 relatives could make it to safety, their ceiling collapsed. Mud and debris washed down to the Tiwaris\u2019 door. They struggled to get out of their own house, and then out of their narrow lane. By the end of the night, 10 people in Surya Nagar, including three children, had been crushed to death. The Tiwaris lost three family members, and 21 more lives were lost in another landslide nearby. By the end of last year\u2019s monsoon season , an estimated 50 Mumbai residents had died in landslides or wall and house collapses triggered by heavy rain\u2014one of the city\u2019s worst tolls in recent memory. In the geography of climate risk, some places are more vulnerable than others, and coastal megacities like Mumbai face the combined threat of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. As their populations expand\u2014by 2050, most of the world\u2019s people will live in urban areas\u2014the paving over of permeable soil for houses and roads further increases the risk of flooding. Like the rest of India, Mumbai is no stranger to what headline writers like to call \u201cmonsoon fury.\u201d The city receives an average of about 94 inches of rain annually, more than double New York\u2019s rainfall, and most of it arrives during the four-month rainy season. For years, the city and its residents have met the monsoon with precautionary measures including the clearing of municipal drains and the plastering of leaky roofs. Those measures have never been quite enough: The season has long been marked by disruptions in train services, upticks in water-borne diseases, and occasional landslides and building collapses. Mumbaikars have tolerated these hazards in exchange for the economic opportunity offered by India\u2019s commercial capital. People here are known for getting back to work quickly after a disaster, whether the disaster is a terrorist strike or a deluge. But climate change could stretch Mumbai\u2019s fortitude to its limits. Severe flooding used to occur once every few years. Now, intense-rainfall events occur almost every year. As the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea increases, sea levels rise, and the city continues to sprawl over floodplains and hills\u2014from 1991 to 2018, the city lost 58 percent of its already limited open space\u2014Mumbai is routinely ranked high on lists of the world\u2019s cities most vulnerable to climate impacts. City authorities, now finalizing a climate action plan, must confront long-standing inadequacies in housing, drainage, and sanitation, and resolve historical tensions between development interests and environmental protection. Working-class communities in hillside areas such as Surya Nagar may have to think about eventual relocation, however difficult. At every level, Mumbai is facing new dangers and new decisions. L ike many coastal settlements , Mumbai stands on land hewn from water. In the 18th and 19th centuries, British colonists leveled the hills on the small islands of what is now called the Mithi River estuary, using the resulting debris to join the archipelago into a narrow peninsula on the northwest coast of India. One British official, describing how the original seven islands had been shaken loose from the mainland by tectonic shifts, suggested that the reclamation was fated. \u201cProvidence \u2026 decreed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey should be once more united by the genius and energy of man.\u201d Despite the location\u2019s challenges\u2014malarial swamps, a lack of fresh water, and the need to build bunds and embankments to protect areas at or below sea level\u2014the city became one of the most important ports in the region, a magnet for trade, industry, and labor. \u201cIs it not an astounding feat,\u201d marveled an Indian writer in 1863, \u201cto recover the land from the sea and make it habitable and free of disease and earn lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of rupees in the process?\u201d During the 20th century, Mumbai expanded to accommodate its growing economy and population. More creeks, streams, and mangroves began to vanish under roads, buildings, and sewage. But every year, the rivers reminded the city of their existence. From June to September, the southwest monsoon sweeps up the west coast of India and into the hinterlands, filling lakes and reconnecting rivers with the sea. For Mumbai, one of the world\u2019s most crowded cities, the season\u2019s cool, clean air and leafy shade is a relief\u2014but it\u2019s also a warning, especially in neighborhoods where the tides once flowed. The city\u2019s defensive rituals, already well established, have multiplied in recent years. Before the monsoon, people buy umbrellas and plastic footwear. Apartment-building owners and residents repair or waterproof their walls and roofs. During the monsoon, shops in low-lying neighborhoods remove merchandise from the bottom shelves. Commuters brace for traffic or train disruptions and parents look out for school cancellations. All kinds of improvised measures are on display in Kranti Nagar, a settlement of old and new migrants sandwiched between the airport and a series of metal scrap yards on the banks of the Mithi River. On a weekday in September, the sky is gray and the ground dark from a morning drizzle. Tarpaulins cover Kranti Nagar\u2019s roofs, and clothes are hanging out to dry as best they can. Inside the maze of single- and double-story brick-and-tin tenements, it\u2019s impossible to tell that a river runs nearby. But the residents know. In a tiny room close to the river, Ranju Devi, a mother of two, reaches up to the light switch just above her head, a little more than five feet from the ground. That\u2019s how high the water can rise, she tells me, when high tides and heavy rain combine and the river swells beyond its banks. Devi and her husband store the family\u2019s clothes and documents on a high shelf so that important possessions don\u2019t get ruined. When the water rises, they take their children and some food to the municipal school, which is located on higher ground nearby. Sometimes, they have to move quickly\u2014one night, she says, she woke up to water at her feet. The Sonar family, a few twisting lanes away, can afford a double-story tenement. They watch the news for weather alerts and know their escape routine: first switch off their lane\u2019s power mains, then move their belongings and themselves upstairs. On the second floor, they\u2019re protected from electrocution and drowning, but they\u2019re still exposed to the chemicals and sewage in the floodwaters, which cause outbreaks of gastroenteritis, and the malaria and dengue that spread as the water stagnates. But Tulsa Sonar, the family matriarch, doesn\u2019t see a way out of the neighborhood: Kranti Nagar is in the heart of the city, surrounded by schools, hospitals, small factories, and offices. A family of 11, the Sonars would either have to pay three to five times as much to live in more secure housing in the same area or endure long commutes to the city\u2019s schools and jobs. Besides, their local elected representative has promised them a safer home nearby. The Sonars first moved here from Nepal in search of work in the mid-\u201970s, when Tulsa was a teenager, and she says there was less flooding then. The problems started when the regional planning agency reclaimed hundreds of acres of mangrove-covered floodplains downstream and covered the newly elevated land with glass-and-steel office complexes. Then airport authorities extended the airport\u2019s runways, narrowing and bending the Mithi River. More settlements and small factories rose along the riverbanks, their sewage and effluent further choking the river\u2019s flow. More recently, the city raised the main road near Kranti Nagar, creating a steep slope to the riverbank settlements. Some wealthy neighborhoods face flooding too. In a prosperous seaside housing development in the western suburb of Khar, ground-floor residents such as Shalini Balsavar move their clothes and valuables to higher shelves during the monsoon. Balsavar has swapped her wooden furniture for sofas and tables with aluminum legs. Flooding in the area started in the \u201980s and \u201990s, her daughter Reetha tells me, when settlements and residential buildings replaced mangrove stands along the shore, reducing the capacity of the land to drain water. In the 2000s, the problem was aggravated when the city raised the main road, increasing water flow into the Balsavars\u2019 property. Some ground-floor residents in the area have left, while others hope to add extra floors to their building. The Balsavars own all three floors of their building, so during a bad flood, Shalini can easily move to safety. \u201cWe have an alternative,\u201d says Reetha, who lives on the second floor. \u201cOthers are not so lucky.\u201d That \u201cluck\u201d is becoming more important. Instead of steady rain through the monsoon season, Mumbai now experiences more days of heavy rainfall, defined as more than two and a half inches in 24 hours, interspersed with long dry breaks. Throughout western India, extreme-precipitation events increased threefold from 1950 to 2015 due to an increase in atmospheric moisture from a warming Arabian Sea. Research suggests that the short bursts of extreme rain that trigger flash floods and landslides will continue to increase as temperatures rise. The city itself may amplify these trends: Local scientists have found that clusters of concrete structures generate warmer temperatures and atmospheric instability that could be intensifying monsoon rainfall. And there are new threats: From 2001 to 2019, rising ocean temperatures led to a 52 percent increase in the region\u2019s cyclone frequency and a 150 percent increase in the number of very severe storms, while cyclone duration increased by 80 percent. Mumbai has not suffered a serious hit from a cyclone since 1948, but a few storms have recently come close. For reasons scientists don\u2019t fully understand, the monsoon season is also ending later, meaning that city residents must stay vigilant into the fall. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been flooded in October,\u201d says Kranti Nagar\u2019s Tulsa Sonar, \u201cbut this year, who can tell?\u201d O n July 26, 2005 , three feet of rain fell on Mumbai, taking more than a thousand lives in flash floods and landslides and causing millions of dollars in damages. In many areas, residents were rescued from rooftops and couldn\u2019t return home for days. Though flooding had been increasing for a decade, the deluge awakened Mumbaikars to the geography of their city\u2014its hemmed-in streams and rivers and its vulnerability to the tides\u2014and the dangers of the monsoon. Since 2005, civic authorities have spent more and more money on flood-mitigation measures, largely due to prodding from citizens\u2019 groups and judicial orders. In recent years, they\u2019ve begun installing floodgates and pumping stations along parts of the seashore\u2014only six of the city\u2019s 174 stormwater outfalls lie above the high-tide line, so when heavy rain combines with high tide, gates are needed to stop tidal inflow and pumps must physically push rainwater out. Authorities have also set up smaller water pumps along parts of the Mithi River and are experimenting with large underground tanks designed to catch and store water below one of the city\u2019s lowest-lying areas. A long-delayed plan to expand the capacity of the city\u2019s century-old stormwater drains has been revived and updated. And the desilting and unclogging of open drains, streams, and rivers increases every year: By the end of last year\u2019s monsoon, workers planned to remove nearly 220,000 tons of gunk from the Mithi. The city has built retaining walls along some rivers and has improved weather monitoring and disaster-response systems. Now when high tide coincides with heavy rain, evacuation alerts are issued to riverside settlements such as Kranti Nagar. No one knows the limitations of these measures better than Mahesh Narvekar, the head of the municipality\u2019s disaster-management unit. Set up in 2000, the unit became active after the 2005 floods and has been expanding since. The department now runs a state-of-the-art control room in the municipal headquarters, where staff monitor feeds from 60 automated weather stations; 147 hospitals; 5,000 CCTVs; and social media. During the monsoon season, staff must coordinate responses to instances such as landslides, housing collapses, tree falls, and power outages. Inside the department\u2019s headquarters, an official shows me old CCTV footage of a tree falling on a moving car; passersby leap into action to rescue the motorist. In another video, a car drifts into a flooded street while bystanders watch to see if they need to intervene. \u201cSee how our Mumbaikars respond,\u201d the officer remarks proudly, adding that more people should receive emergency training. Over the past two decades, the unit has dealt with not only floods and landslides but multiple terrorist strikes and a global pandemic. \u201cDisaster response is okay; we can do it. We have the experience,\u201d Narvekar says. But he\u2019s worried about the future. Though the department is working to communicate more quickly with local residents, expand backup-power supplies, and improve its hazard mapping, that may not be enough to protect residents from possible superstorms, or the roughly six inches of sea-level rise expected by 2050. Even expanded drains and river dredging can do only so much. \u201cHow much can you expand [stormwater] pipes and widen streams in a city that\u2019s so densely developed?\u201d he asks. What\u2019s needed, he believes, is a paradigm shift\u2014a climate-adaptation plan equal to Mumbai\u2019s future. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop excess inundation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole city must become a drain.\u201d O n August 27 , state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, the environment and tourism minister of the state of Maharashtra, launched the Mumbai Climate Action Plan website in coordination with municipal officials, touting it as the first such initiative of its kind in urban India and South Asia. At the launch, the municipal commissioner, Iqbal Singh Chahal, noted that most of July\u2019s rainfall had fallen in just four days and that cyclones in the region were increasing in frequency. He warned, rather hyperbolically, that much of the office and government district, located in the historic southern tip of the city, could be \u201cunderwater\u201d by 2050. Climate change \u201chas come to our doorstep,\u201d he said. The India office of the Washington, D.C.\u2013based World Resources Institute was entrusted with helping design the climate plan, and its first step was to hold a series of public consultations with local groups and experts. Lubaina Rangwala, the program head of the urban-development-and-resilience team at WRI India, told me in September that her objective was to come up with a \u201chigh-level road map\u201d rather than a detailed plan. Engineering solutions such as sea walls, pumps, and underground tanks are important, she says. But like Narvekar, the head of the disaster-management unit, she doubts they will suffice in the long run. \u201cInfrastructure is designed for certain thresholds,\u201d she says. \u201cA tank has a capacity; it can hold a certain amount of water until the tide ebbs and the water can drain.\u201d But if rainfall or tides are extreme, that capacity may fall short, she notes. \u201cThe uncertainty of extreme occurrences is what makes us believe that [engineering solutions] won\u2019t be enough.\u201d In recent years, local architects and researchers have pointed out that walls and other barriers can harden the battle lines between land and water, and have argued that the rivers and sea need to be integrated into the urban landscape\u2014by, for instance, maintaining natural riverbanks that can help absorb overflow. \u201cWe do need to see the city as an estuary,\u201d Rangwala says. \u201cWe need to think about the percolative nature of the land, and about protecting the natural infrastructures of mudflats and wetlands.\u201d Development interests have long stood in the way of such measures. After the 2005 disaster, for instance, a high-level state-government committee laid out a series of measures for mitigating floods. Although the city implemented engineering solutions such as pumps, drains, and retaining walls, the recommendations that carried even short-term costs for development interests\u2014such as flood-risk zoning around waterways that would affect the real-estate market\u2014were ignored. Rangwala acknowledges that in a city driven by commerce, systematic reforms are difficult. But she thinks the political moment is ripe for progress, and not only because of the new global attention on climate change. \u201cWe used to say environment was anti-development; now we talk of the two in tandem,\u201d she says. \u201cThat change has happened with this [state] government coming in.\u201d Thackeray, the state environment minister, is a scion of one of Mumbai\u2019s most prominent political families. His grandfather founded the Shiv Sena, a nativist party known for decades for its attacks on migrants from the rest of the country. In 2019, the party took power in the state government after a prolonged tussle with the Bharatiya Janata Party, its erstwhile ally and the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Though the Shiv Sena has dominated the city\u2019s government for two decades, its greater power in the state\u2014along with the rise of new, younger leaders\u2014appears to be reshaping its agenda. Thackeray\u2019s father, Uddhav, the head of the state government, enjoys wildlife photography, and his sons are also interested in ecology: Thackeray\u2019s younger brother, Tejas, a wildlife researcher, has discovered several new species\u2014including a swamp eel, a snake, and a lizard\u2014in the state\u2019s lush and underdocumented Western Ghats mountain range. The younger Thackerays\u2019 interest in the environment is partly generational, says D. Parthasarathy, a sociology professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, an elite research institution. Young people in India and around the world are more concerned about climate change and environmental issues, and 31-year-old Aaditya was one of the few state-level Indian politicians to attend the COP26 talks at Glasgow. But the agenda is also politically strategic: Before they took office, both Aaditya and his father backed a popular residents\u2019 movement to save a piece of suburban forest from an infrastructure project, much to the annoyance of their then-allies. They promised to clean up a massive and polluting landfill in another part of the city that had become a political issue for the local community. \u201cThe [state] government came to power on such issues,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cThey are under pressure to fulfill their promises too.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean they can or will break with business as usual in Mumbai. The Shiv Sena government is not halting one of the city\u2019s most controversial and expensive projects, a 29-kilometer coastal freeway along Mumbai\u2019s western waterfront. The road has been opposed by environmentalists and architects who believe it could lead to coastal erosion and flooding while serving relatively few commuters, and by local fishing communities that say their fishing grounds are being destroyed by extensive reclamation. It\u2019s also not clear how the government will handle recently relaxed national-government regulations that permit more development along the coastline. Political parties need funds, points out Parthasarathy, which makes it risky for them to alienate the city\u2019s wealthy developers. He adds that infrastructure projects have their own political logic: \u201cThere\u2019s an imagination to [infrastructure], a sense that it represents modernity.\u201d M ore than a month after the landslide that killed their relatives, the Tiwaris were still staying with friends in a nearby community. But their neighbors, the Vishwakarmas, had returned home to Surya Nagar, ignoring the warning that the city had pasted on their door. They are a three-generation family of seven. \u201cHow long can we stay with friends?\u201d shrugged 29-year-old Sudhir Vishwakarma, the youngest son. Sudhir and his friends were among the first responders to the landslide; they helped evacuate people and, later, dig out bodies. Ambulances and earth movers couldn\u2019t access the site without destroying homes. The boys didn\u2019t sleep for days, and hardly ate. Since then, every time it rains at night, families in the neighborhood keep their doors open and call out to one another. Many climate-adaptation projects talk of making cities and communities more \u201cresilient,\u201d more able to cope with or adapt to extreme events like floods and heat waves. But without accompanying efforts to address social vulnerabilities, initiatives to increase resilience can place the burden of adaptation on individuals and on local communities, especially in developing countries, Parthasarathy says. Mumbaikars\u2019 ability to help one another in times of crisis or bounce back after a disaster is often celebrated by political leaders and the media. But \u201cthe spirit of resilience exists out of compulsion,\u201d Parthasarathy says, \u201cbecause the state is not doing its job. The people must cope somehow.\u201d Resilience also has hidden costs, he adds. Even people who respond stoically to chronic hazards\u2014\u201cwater comes and water goes,\u201d as one resident of Kranti Nagar told me\u2014lose time and money in dealing with them, and may sacrifice their health. Interruptions in schooling become more frequent, and saving money becomes more difficult. \u201cPeople who are busy surviving aren\u2019t able to invest in the future,\u201d Parthasarathy says. Parthasarathy prefers to use the word transformation . Instead of adapting to and coping with a particular hazard, he says, \u201cwe need to reimagine the city and the idea of development.\u201d His research group is working with officials and local groups on a mangrove-restoration project to achieve both environmental and social objectives. Mangroves can mitigate flooding while also providing a livelihood to local fishers, he notes. For the people of Surya Nagar and Kranti Nagar, transformation might mean moving to safe and affordable housing elsewhere in the city. Because of the lack of affordable options, people who are evicted from hazardous neighborhoods often go and live in even more vulnerable ones, notes Roshni Nuggehalli, the executive director of YUVA, a nonprofit that works with the urban poor. Over the past few decades, the government has tried to incentivize developers to rehabilitate informal dwellings\u2014but many of the resulting housing projects have been poorly constructed or unsanitary. \u201cWhat we need to address is not the climate event,\u201d Nugehalli says, \u201cbut the systemic things that aggravate the climate event.\u201d A fter the landslide in Surya Nagar , city authorities quickly announced compensation to the families of those who died\u2014several hundred thousand rupees per life, enough to support a poor family for a year or two but of little comfort to the bereaved. One man lost his wife and two children; he survived only because he happened to be working that night. \u201cIf there are no people, what\u2019s the point of money?\u201d asks Jaya, Sudhir\u2019s sister-in-law. When Sudhir\u2019s late father moved here from northern India more than 30 years ago, the neighborhood was set among forested hills and mangrove stands and surrounded by new factories with jobs for migrant workers. He built a good life for his wife and children, and Sudhir, now an engineer, is one of the first professionals in the family. But he still can\u2019t afford to live in the upscale residential complexes that now crowd the neighborhood. Sudhir and his neighbors don\u2019t know much about climate change, but they do sense that their home is becoming more dangerous. Many point out that though the 2017 landslide took two lives, last summer\u2019s took 10. (Local officials and politicians likely knew of the danger: In early 2021, an internal report warned of the risk to precariously perched settlements in the area.) Yet most are not ready to leave the neighborhood. Nearby homes down the slope or on level ground are more expensive, and the pandemic\u2019s toll on income and work has put them even further out of reach. Cheaper digs are distant. What they want is for the municipality to protect Surya Nagar with a strong retaining wall. And they seem likely to get it: After the landslide, Aaditya Thackeray directed authorities to speed up retaining-wall construction in unstable areas. Yet a wall did not help Ambedkar Nagar, a much poorer settlement on the other side of the hill. Its shanties stand above a network of apartment complexes, and just below a water reservoir surrounded by forest. In the 2010s, authorities built a 15-foot-high boundary wall to protect the reservoir from urban expansion. But on one extremely rainy night in 2019, water built up behind the barrier and then broke through. The torrent, carrying chunks of concrete, swept away the bamboo and tarpaulin shanties below, killing about 30 people and injuring another 130. Later, an audit commissioned by the city found that the wall had been poorly designed and constructed. Eighty-six families who had lost homes and relatives were rehoused in low-income developments on the other side of the city; 75 more are still waiting to be relocated. A few residents have refused to move, including Bomba Devi, a mother of three. When she came to Ambedkar Nagar in the mid-\u201990s, it was not unusual for leopards from the nearby forest to prowl the hillside. Though she lost a young granddaughter in the flash flood of 2019, she rejected the alternative housing because it was located next to chemical plants and a refinery, and residents there had already fallen ill. (Residents\u2019 health problems were so serious that they sued, resulting in a court decision that blocked the city from relocating people to the area.) Besides, her son works in the local packing firm and her grandchildren go to the nearby public school. To protect her home, she and her children have created small channels and drains in the mud floor that direct the water downstream. Even so, their home is flooded with a foot of water every year. In May, a cyclone brought record rain and winds strong enough to dislodge some boulders above the neighborhood. The residents took refuge in a clearing of sorts\u2014a slightly elevated, flat patch of land kept dry with a thatched roof and strategically dug channels. It was safer than being inside their homes, says Moli Sheikh, Bomba Devi\u2019s neighbor, adding, \u201cWe draw strength from being together.\u201d The morning I visited, more than a dozen residents were sitting in the clearing, participating in an ongoing sit-in. They are demanding that the wall be rebuilt and alternative housing be provided nearby. Many of them had paid into a public-housing scheme intended to provide them with new homes, but so far they have received nothing. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an incident, they come and do a survey\u201d of the damage done and the families that need to be relocated, Sheikh says, pointing to the row of numbers that officials have chalked on his door. \u201cWhat are they waiting for?\u201d This Atlantic Planet story was supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.

{"id":null,"body":"These are the most effective carbon offsets and climate-advocacy groups, according to a new evidence-based group. Every Tuesday morning, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . Let\u2019s say you want to donate $25 to fighting climate change. Where should your money go? Since I started this newsletter, this inquiry (or something like it) is among the most common questions I\u2019ve received from readers. And for good reason: There are at least 461 nonprofits in the United States devoted to environmental causes, according to the evaluator Charity Navigator. Not all of them approach climate change effectively, or even do what they claim to. The green-nonprofit world is a thicket, contained in a morass, reachable only by slog. Daniel Stein, an economist who trained at the London School of Economics, learned this lesson about 18 months ago when he went looking for the best ways to maximize his climate giving. \u201cI thought I could find the information after a couple hours of Googling,\u201d he told me last week. \u201cBut not only could I not find it, a lot of the information that I could find was straight-up wrong.\u201d So he founded Giving Green , to help people ford the swamp. Giving Green advises people on how to fight climate change with their donations in the most evidence-based way possible. It emerged from beta and published new recommendations last month. Because today is Giving Tuesday\u2014the capstone of America\u2019s ersatz Holy Week and the only square on the calendar devoted to philanthropy\u2014I wanted to look at those recommendations. Some background: Giving Green is part of the effective-altruism movement, which tries to answer questions such as \u201cHow can someone do the most good?\u201d with scientific rigor. Or at least with econometric rigor. Some readers of this newsletter might be familiar with GiveWell , which tries to find charities that save the most lives on a dollar-per-dollar basis. It uses randomized control trials and empirical evidence to identify charities that it says \u201cimprove lives the most per dollar.\u201d Giving Green applies this same principle to climate change. It asks: If you donate a dollar to fighting climate change, where will your money go furthest? Right now, it makes recommendations in two areas: carbon offsets and policy change. Each illustrates the benefits of its approach\u2014and the potential problems. Carbon offsetting should be a perfect fit for Giving Green. There\u2019s nothing theoretically impossible about using money to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet doing so has proved devilishly hard in practice. The field is haunted by an idea called \u201cadditionality,\u201d which says that every additional dollar spent on offsets should prevent additional CO\u2082 pollution. According to the European Union, about 85 percent of carbon-offset projects don\u2019t have additionality. That is, they might prevent some carbon pollution, but the amount of pollution prevented doesn\u2019t reliably match the amount of money spent. Giving Green recommends three carbon-offsetting programs that it says have strong additionality (among other traits): 1. The best way to offset additional carbon pollution is to permanently remove existing carbon pollution from the atmosphere. This is what the Swiss company Climeworks does : It sucks carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid material underground. This is the \u201cmost certain\u201d way to offset carbon emissions, according to Giving Green; it\u2019s also the most expensive. Climeworks charges more than $1,000 to remove a ton of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere. For context: If you wanted to offset the carbon dioxide emitted by the average U.S. car each year, you\u2019d be set back $4,600. This is out of reach for most people. So Climeworks offers a subscription service : You can pay the company to capture a small amount of carbon every month in your name. For $8 a month, Climeworks will, over the course of a year, remove 85 kilograms of CO\u2082\u2014about as much as the average car releases in 210 miles of driving. 2. There are cheaper ways to offset carbon pollution. Giving Green also recommends Tradewater , which finds and destroys stores of chemical refrigerants that are more than 10,000 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide is. Because Tradewater targets chemicals that are so much more potent than CO\u2082, and because it doesn\u2019t need to remove those gases from the atmosphere\u2014it only needs to keep them from reaching the atmosphere\u2014it is much cheaper than Climeworks. At $15 a ton, Tradewater \u201coffers one of the most attractive combinations of price and certainty,\u201d Giving Green says. 3. Finally, Giving Green recommends BURN , which provides fuel-efficient cookstoves to people in Kenya. BURN requires $10 to prevent a ton of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. (While many of the early hopes for efficient cookstoves haven\u2019t panned out , Giving Green says that the BURN approach is backed by research .) So if you are going to donate $25 to fighting climate change, which of these groups should you give to? None of them, Stein told me. If you want to seriously fight climate change, he said, you need to move beyond buying offsets to supporting \u201clower-certainty but higher-potential-impact spaces\u201d\u2014specifically, policy. On policy, Giving Green recommends that donors support two very different organizations\u2014 the Clean Air Task Force and the Sunrise Movement . The Clean Air Task Force works with policy makers in both parties to deploy technologies that could alter the basic math of climate change. Essentially that means it promotes new kinds of nuclear energy, improvements to the power grid, and machines that capture carbon from smokestacks or from the open air. It\u2019s technocratic and nonpartisan. The Sunrise Movement , by contrast, champions the Green New Deal, which calls for massive investment in climate-action and social-welfare programs. Sunrise is one of the most visible activist organizations on the American left, and it\u2019s informally allied with Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and other progressive leaders. So it\u2019s assertively partisan, aiming to help Democrats win elections while compelling their party to recognize climate change as an emergency. Giving Green certifies both organizations as highly effective, but says that donors should choose one or the other based on their theory of how the political system works. If donors believe pragmatic dealmaking gets results, then they should choose the Clean Air Task Force. Giving Green says it has a \u201clong track record of successfully advocating for national-level policy change.\u201d But if donors trust that passionate activism and shifting the terms of national debate will triumph over the long term, then they should go with Sunrise. Though that group is only a few years old, Giving Green says that it \u201cshows promise\u201d and that it has a \u201cstrong theory of change and some victories.\u201d (Technically, Giving Green advises that donors give to the Sunrise Movement\u2019s education fund , which is\u2014again, technically\u2014nonpartisan. Because Giving Green is part of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, it cannot support partisan political groups.) Sunrise is certainly the more controversial of the two groups. It has vacillated on the utility of nuclear energy and carbon-removal technology, and it gave President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s climate plan a low grade during the 2020 Democratic primary. (It then endorsed him during the general election.) I asked Stein whether Giving Green\u2019s recommendation might alienate more centrist or conservative donors. \u201cThat is unquestionably right,\u201d he said. \u201cSunrise is associated with policies that are on the left side of the political spectrum \u2026 and there\u2019s risk of that, there\u2019s risk of blowback. \u201cBut how does change get done?\u201d he continued. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s bipartisan compromise, but sometimes it\u2019s extremely passionate people on one side.\u201d Many of Sunrise\u2019s tactics are borrowed from the civil-rights movement, he said\u2014a cause that was undeniably effective at changing U.S. policy. Ultimately, Giving Green reveals the value\u2014and the limits\u2014of an evidence-based approach to philanthropy. Jennifer Rubenstein , a political-theory professor at the University of Virginia who has written about effective altruism , told me that she thinks the methodology is good at helping donors avoid the worst 15 percent of nonprofits. Giving Green has likely done so here. But in climate, it faces a harder, even epistemological, question. The carbon-offset question is knowable; some organizations remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere better than others, and it is possible to learn their names. But supporting political action, as Giving Green recommends, goes beyond the realm of quantifiable evidence; it requires arguing about what will change people\u2019s behavior. Sunrise and the Clean Air Task Force are good options for certain kinds of donors. But to support either group is to make a bet about the future. And nobody can run a randomized controlled trial on the future. Our reader Karen Buczynski-Lee shared this photo of a misty, rainy day in Bagni di Lucca, Italy. November was unusually warm nearly everywhere in the world, including Italy. It was far and away the warmest November on record, and nearly 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than Novembers during the late 19th century. Every week, I feature a weather photo from a reader or professional in this part of the newsletter, because the climate is someone else\u2019s weather. If you would like to submit one, please email weeklyplanet@theatlantic.com. 1. We\u2019re still waiting to find out who will fill many of the most important climate positions in the Biden administration. We don\u2019t know who will lead the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Energy under Biden, nor do we know who will serve as his domestic-climate-policy chief. (John Kerry will lead climate policy abroad.) But one important name has come into focus: Brian Deese will direct the White House National Economic Council , making him Biden\u2019s top economic adviser . Deese\u2019s nomination has aroused some controversy. Deese led a White House regulatory office during the Obama administration. But he left to lead environmental efforts at BlackRock, an investment powerhouse that owns a huge share of the U.S. economy, by dint of operating some of the world\u2019s most successful index funds. Some climate activists argue that BlackRock, by idly owning many fossil-fuel companies, is making global warming worse ; progressive activists take issue with its attempt to relax financial regulation. This history led the Sunrise Movement to oppose Deese\u2019s nomination\u2014which, in turn, led Bill McKibben, who has written about climate change since the 1980s and is perhaps the country\u2019s most influential climate activist, to endorse Deese\u2019s nomination . McKibben, in fact, had officiated Deese\u2019s wedding. \u201cI imagine he'll work steadfastly and competently and honorably, to the betterment of the world, and that he'll get a lot done,\u201d McKibben said of Deese. I tell this story not to come down on one side or the other. Instead, I want to call attention to a conflict that will become more common as investment firms become larger players in the climate fight and actively push poorly performing companies to do better. Activists\u2019 skepticism of financial power and the use of that corporate power to accelerate climate action are going to collide. 2. An EPA investigation has found that diesel-engine tuners, installed on pickup trucks, are responsible for a staggering amount of air pollution. Trucks with these devices are collectively responsible for emitting 10 times more nitrogen-dioxide pollution than the cars at the center of the Volkswagen scandal . Yet the Trump administration hasn\u2019t yet publicized the paper that reached these conclusions , The New York Times reports. 3. Some reasonably good news: Bank of America has announced that it won\u2019t finance any oil exploration or drilling in the Arctic. This means that none of the six major U.S. banks will fund Arctic drilling, a potential obstacle for any company that might want to pursue it. (An anemic global oil market doesn\u2019t help much either.) Thanks for reading. Did someone forward you this newsletter?

{"id":null,"body":"Fox News headliner Glenn Beck usually isn't much of a friend to the environmentalist movement; it was only a few days ago that he included \"global warming\" in a list of destructive lies foisted on the American public, and a few days before that that he seemed to recommend ritual suicide for scientists affiliated with the IPCC. It's a stance, one or two steps beyond skepticism, that Beck shares with most of his Fox News colleagues. So it was surprising to learn, in the course of Dennis McCafferty's breezy USA Weekend profile , that Beck is apparently a member of the global-warming faithful in his private life: Was Beck misquoted? Taken out of context, maybe? The news host spoke to the issue a few days ago, complaining about inaccuracies in McCafferty's piece. But Mother Jones's Kate Sheppard notes that while \"Beck had plenty of criticism of the USA Weekend story... he didn't raise any objections to the article's portrayal of his environmental views.\" Perhaps Beck has had a change of heart--which would make his tiff with Al Gore in this Babbleheads cartoon seem sadly dated.","headline":"Glenn Beck, Climate Change Believer","article_name":341282.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/02\/glenn-beck-climate-change-believer\/341282\/","date_published":"2010-02-25 22:08:49","article_length":1088,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:26.265788","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/02\/glenn-beck-climate-change-believer\/341282\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"They\u2019re hoping that the vice-presidential nominee will be as malleable as Joe Biden. The far left of the Democratic Party spent much of the primary attacking Kamala Harris, decrying her as an untrustworthy \u201ccop\u201d whose overtures to the left were half-hearted and opportunistic. But with Joe Biden naming the senator from California as his running mate, some progressive leaders and activists, including Harris skeptics, sound reluctantly optimistic about what the pair could achieve. The progressives I interviewed seem to view Harris and Biden as similar figures, occupying an \u201cin-between space\u201d in American politics, as one activist put it to me. Their political identities and agendas are a muddled mix of the old establishment Democratic politics and the progressivism of the surging Millennial left\u2014a combination progressives believe they can work with. They think that, just as Biden has already welcomed progressive input in his campaign, Harris could be malleable, a potential vice president they can push in their ideological direction. \u201cThe same guy who was willing to sit down with Strom Thurmond is now talking like he wants to be the 21st-century FDR,\u201d Julian Brave NoiseCat, the vice president of policy and strategy at the progressive polling firm Data for Progress, told me. \u201cA savvy politician like Harris is going to see where the winds are blowing and move in that direction.\u201d Harris, who joined the Senate four years ago, described herself a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d in her previous career, but many lefties have never claimed her as one of their own. That\u2019s largely because of her long and complicated record in law enforcement. As California\u2019s attorney general, a position she held from 2011 to 2017, Harris repeatedly declined to investigate officer-involved shootings. Activists in California also criticized her for not supporting reforms that would have increased police accountability; for championing an anti-truancy law that disproportionately  affected parents of color; and for aggressively prosecuting misdemeanors and so-called quality-of-life crimes, such as panhandling and graffiti. Read: When Kamala was a top cop More recently, during the 2020 primary, lefties argued that she wasn\u2019t sufficiently committed to progressive reforms. After initially backing Medicare for All and the elimination of private health insurance, for example, Harris walked back those commitments and developed her own health-care plan . \u201cA lot of why she floundered in the primary was that it was unclear where she stood on a number of things,\u201d Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive organization Justice Democrats, told me. But Harris does have some clear progressive bona fides. A GovTrack analysis showed that she had one of the most liberal voting records of any sitting senator in 2019. She announced her support for the Green New Deal early that year, and this month teamed up with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on a bill that would require the federal government to consider the effect of any new environmental legislation on marginalized communities. Throughout the summer, as protests against racism and police brutality erupted in cities across the country, Harris advocated for banning choke holds and no-knock warrants, and called for \u201c reimagining how we do public safety in America.\u201d The progressives I spoke with don\u2019t really care if those moves were genuine or motivated in part by politics. They just want Harris to make more of them. \u201cHer collaboration with AOC on the Climate Equity Act shows that she can take some fairly left-wing and justice-oriented conversations to the highest office in the land, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d NoiseCat said. Others framed her leftward shift more cynically: \u201cWhile her penchant for taking positions broadly palatable to the corporate donor class raises concerns about her dedication to progressive principles, her habit of aligning her stance with the prevailing political winds gives us some hope,\u201d the leaders of RootsAction.org and Progressive Democrats of America said in a statement yesterday. Harris\u2019s potentially pliable ideology, in other words, could prove useful to progressives. It\u2019s also something that she has in common with her running mate. When I asked him to define Harris\u2019s politics, Larry Cohen, the chairman of Our Revolution, the political-action committee spun out of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign, described her the same way one might describe Biden: \u201ca centrist Democrat who has shown willingness in the past to consider progressive ideas.\u201d Read: Biden goes big without sounding like it At one point, a Biden nomination was a nightmare scenario for many American progressives. Yet in the past few months, the former vice president and his fiercest critics on the left have reached a tentative d\u00e9tente: Biden has adopted some of the most liberal policies proposed by his former primary rivals, including Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy plan , and he invited a group of Sanders-aligned activists to advise his campaign. The $2 trillion climate plan he announced in mid-July was met with glowing praise from influential lefty groups such as the Sunrise Movement, which first came to national prominence after its members held a protest outside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Capitol Hill. \u201cSome of our administrations who have been the boldest haven\u2019t always been the most progressive,\u201d Tory Gavito, the president and co-founder of the progressive Way to Win network, told me. Many liberal Democrats were skeptical of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s commitment to progressive reforms when he arrived in office, given his southern background and establishment ties. But Johnson was responsible for \u201csome of the most levelizing, equalizing policies in recent history,\u201d Gavito noted, adding that progressives shouldn\u2019t underestimate the potential for similarly ambitious legislation from a Biden-Harris administration. Many progressives, though, are still highly skeptical of Biden\u2019s VP pick. Some of the activists and organizers behind this summer\u2019s protests believe that Harris is exactly the wrong person to lead the country through this pivotal moment. (Even some statements in support of Harris\u2019s nomination alluded to this concern .) Given Biden\u2019s age, his vice president would likely be viewed as a \u201cpotential president-in-waiting\u201d and \u201ca signal for the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda in the years to come,\u201d as my colleague Christian Paz wrote last month . While that\u2019s exciting for progressives eager to see a Black woman occupy the highest office in the land, the idea that Harris represents the party\u2019s future is a worrying prospect for others who are focused primarily on pushing radical change. The next generation of voters \u201cwants a more forceful progressivism that\u2019s grounded in racial justice and economic populism,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she has proven that she\u2019s able to do that.\u201d There\u2019s no pretending that Harris was their ideal candidate for vice president, the progressives I talked with acknowledged. They still want and expect Biden to demonstrate his commitment to party unity by appointing more liberal Democrats to key roles in his administration, such as tapping Warren to oversee the Treasury Department. And they\u2019re prepared to apply constant pressure to extract the most progressive policy outcomes if the ticket wins in November. \u201cHarris didn\u2019t run on big reforms and neither did Joe Biden, so progressives are going to be pushing them to go as big as they can,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of the lefty political-action committee Democracy for America.

{"id":null,"body":"A group of GOP lawmakers have signed a resolution warning that \u201cthe consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans.\u201d Will it translate to legislative action? At a time when President Donald Trump is working to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy, more than a dozen House Republicans are calling for action to confront the threat of a changing climate. Seventeen Republican lawmakers, including Elise Stefanik of New York, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Mia Love of Utah, Don Bacon of Nebraska, and Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, introduced a resolution on Wednesday that urges the House of Representatives to \u201caddress the causes and effects\u201d of climate change, \u00a0according to a press release sent out by Costello\u2019s office. The resolution, which revives a call to action endorsed  by nearly a dozen House Republicans in 2015, describes environmental protection as a \u201cconservative principle.\u201d And it warns that \u201cif left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans.\u201d \u201cThis is an issue where there really is consensus within the scientific community,\u201d Sanford said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a larger debate on what to do about it, and that\u2019s a much more complex debate, but it\u2019s like with Alcoholics Anonymous, if you don\u2019t even recognize the fact that you have a problem, you\u2019re never going to address the problem.\u201d Representative Brian Mast of Florida, one of the signers of the resolution, said in an interview that he thinks \u201cit\u2019s important that we take climate change very, very seriously because the threats that are posed by that are very serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just not a person that believes we should be turning a blind eye to it,\u201d he said. The resolution is evidence that at least some congressional Republicans are willing to label climate change a threat despite the fact that President Trump once called global warming \u201ca hoax.\u201d Still, a call to action from a relatively small number of House Republicans won\u2019t necessarily translate into any kind of significant legislation to address global warming. The Republican Party has a track record of rejecting climate-science in recent years, and supporting an agenda that would increase the burning of fossil fuels while eliminating environmental regulation. That\u2019s unlikely to fundamentally change anytime soon. In interviews, several Republican lawmakers who signed the resolution indicated they would consider supporting legislation to incentivize the use of clean energy. A number of legislators sponsoring the resolution made clear, however, that they would not support a carbon tax. Some former Republican officials and conservative policy analysts  have endorsed the idea of imposing a price on carbon emissions, but many elected officials\u2014in a party where opposition to increased taxation has become something of a conservative litmus test \u2014aren\u2019t willing to do the same. \u201cI think that\u2019s a non-starter for Republicans in Congress,\u201d Costello said, adding that he does not support a carbon tax. \u201cI am not there yet, no,\u201d Bacon said when asked if he would back such a policy. \u201cI have not been a supporter of carbon taxes in the past, and I don\u2019t think I would be inclined to as we move into the future,\u201d Representative Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania, another sponsor of the resolution, said in an interview. In an apparent indication of just how difficult it is to get a group of congressional Republicans to endorse any kind of call for climate action, the resolution itself does not explicitly spell out and affirm the scientific consensus that greenhouse gases generated by human activity are the primary driver of global warming. Instead, the declaration notes only that human activity has \u201cbeen found to have an impact\u201d on a changing climate, and calls for \u201cefforts to balance\u201d that impact. Bacon said in an interview that while \u201cthe evidence is clear that there has been an increase in temperature. It\u2019s always a little bit debatable how much is the human element versus cyclical.\u201d But, he said: \u201cRegardless, you still want a cleaner planet,\u201d adding that if Earth\u2019s temperatures continue to rise, that would be \u201ca serious threat.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the hyperventilating, and all the anger out there,\u201d he said, noting that he hopes to \u201cwork across the aisle and find some middle ground on this.\u201d Republican voters have become less likely to believe that human activity is causing Earth\u2019s temperatures to rise over the past decade and a half, despite the fact that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming has only grown more conclusive. Scientists warn that the world is already experiencing the detrimental impacts of global warming, from rising sea levels to volatile weather and more destructive wildfire seasons. As long as the issue remains politically polarizing, consensus over how to confront the problem, and the political will to push for legislative solutions, may not materialize in any meaningful way. Even Republicans who acknowledge climate change may justify congressional inaction by arguing that efforts to curb emissions would harm the economy. Republican Senator John Cornyn wrote in National Review in 2015: \u201cYes, our climate is changing over time and, yes, humans have played some part in that change,\u201d but \u201cnew burdensome regulations would hinder our economy.\u201d The resolution itself notes that \u201cany efforts to mitigate the risks of, prepare for, or otherwise address our changing climate and its effects should not constrain the United States economy.\u201d \u201cWe are way past the point where we can be rewarding people purely for empty statements,\u201d said Ben Schreiber, a senior political strategist at the environmental organization Friends of the Earth. \u201cWill Republicans who acknowledge the threat of climate change work to stop rollbacks of policies that tackle rising emissions, stand up to climate deniers in the administration, or challenge their party leaders who are attacking climate science? That's what really matters, and I don't see evidence of that so far.\u201d Still, even a symbolic call to action from Republican lawmakers could make the political debate over climate change less polarized. \u201cIf more GOP lawmakers start talking about climate change as a real and important risk, and start supporting climate action, that is likely to change the conversation within the GOP and of course, the country at large,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of Yale University\u2019s Program on Climate Change Communication. \u201cIn this case, political leadership matters. Cues from political elites such as public statements and stances of elected officials influence the views of the party rank and file.\u201d Many Americans, including Republican voters, are concerned about man-made global warming. Gallup recently found that a majority of Americans are worried about rising temperatures and believe human activity is responsible for climate change, with 84 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of Republicans reporting concern. \u201cThat\u2019s the unfortunate part, when things become politicized it makes it difficult to not take a hard-line on things,\u201d Mast said. \u201cBut you chip away at it one at a time and that makes it better.\u201d When I asked what he thinks about the fact that Trump has called global warming a \u201choax,\u201d he replied: \u201cWe all have different stances on this issue,\u201d before adding: \u00a0\u201cShould we be able to work with President Trump on this? Absolutely.\u201d A number of the Republicans who signed the resolution represent states or congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in the presidential election. But several of the Republicans\u2014including Representatives Brian Mast of Florida, Mia Love of Utah, and Don Bacon of Nebraska\u2014represent districts and states that voted for Trump. The remaining GOP lawmakers who signed the resolution are, per the release : Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, John Faso, Tom Reed and John Katko of New York, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Dave Reichert of Washington, and Mark Amodei of Nevada. Costello is one of the Republican lawmakers who supported the climate resolution when it was first introduced in 2015, and later faced re-election and won. The GOP congressman, who represents a district Clinton carried in a state Trump won, said in an interview he supported the resolution then because he \u201cthought it was the right thing to do.\u201d But, he argued that \u201cit\u2019s not politically perilous to speak on these issues, and to be viewed as a clean energy Republican who recognizes that climate change is present, and that we should be looking to reduce carbon emissions.\u201d The question now for these congressional Republicans is what comes next, and to what extent they will break with, or back up, the current administration as it pursues its own agenda. Trump has already signed an executive order seeking to undo a water protection regulation enacted by the previous administration. And the administration is expected to initiate a rollback of greenhouse gas regulations that formed a key pillar of Obama\u2019s climate agenda. If Trump follows through with his promise to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and does away with regulations without implementing any kind of alternative policy to curb emissions, calls to action in Congress may do little to reverse, or mitigate, the impacts of global warming on the planet. Curbelo, who has been outspoken on climate change, conceded that \u201cregrettably, there\u2019s a legacy of polarization on this issue.\u201d But, he said, \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do is break that status quo, and open a new chapter of evidenced-based, rational, bipartisan policy action,\u201d describing the resolution as only a \u201cfirst step.\u201d When asked whether it will be harder to achieve consensus on climate solutions in the aftermath of the election, he replied: \u201cI know we have very strong allies in the White House. Hopefully they can win the argument there, and we can win it here in the Congress.\u201d","headline":"Meet the House Republicans Calling for Climate Action in the Trump Era","article_name":518430.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2017\/03\/house-republicans-climate-change-global-warming-trump\/518430\/","date_published":"2017-03-15 15:21:36","article_length":10055,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:27.470625","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2017\/03\/house-republicans-climate-change-global-warming-trump\/518430\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"What happens when we do something\u2014but not enough\u2014to stop climate change? The COP26 international climate-change negotiations have just begun in Glasgow, Scotland, and the vibes are \u2026 ambivalent. The leaders of Russia and China haven\u2019t bothered to attend, but did promise to help end deforestation by 2030\u2014though many observers are skeptical that they will keep their word. In the United States, President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan lost a powerful provision that would have helped convert the nation\u2019s electricity grid to renewable energy, but still includes an unprecedented $555 billion to combat climate change. In a prelude to the conference, the UN added up the most recent pledges of parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement. If all 192 keep their promises, the synthesis found, the planet would still be on track to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius, or 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century. This is nearly twice the 1.5-degree-Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) goal agreed to in principle in Paris. But it is also not nearly the jump predicted in the hottest scenario envisioned in the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u20144.4 degrees Celsius, or 8 degrees Fahrenheit. The world is wandering into a kind of gray area between total failure and real global commitment to containing global warming. In a recent video call to supporters, Varshini Prakash , the head of the Sunrise Movement, which advocates for aggressive action on climate change, said she felt two ways at once\u2014proud \u201cthat we forced Democrats and the president to care about our generation\u201d and also angry. \u201cI feel disappointed that this is all that we\u2019ve won,\u201d she said. It is hard to know how to feel. A future of possibly 5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming seems like an unknown country. Is it a civilization-ending crisis? Or is it a more familiar version of awful\u2014a bit sweatier, more chaotic, and less just than the world we currently inhabit? Brian O\u2019Neill , the director of the Joint Global Change Research Institute, a partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and the University of Maryland at College Park, has a clearer view of this question than most of us. He was one of the lead architects of the five different futures\u2014called \u201cshared socioeconomic pathways,\u201d or SSPs\u2014 developed for the latest IPCC report . Read: The key insight that defined 50 years of climate science These five futures aren\u2019t just versions of 2100 at different temperatures. Each started with a different idea about how society might develop . The SSP 1 pathway, which keeps us under that 1.5-degree-Celsius goal, for example, is the \u201cSustainability\u201d path. In this scenario, the global economy still expands, but humanity \u201cshifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being, even at the expense of somewhat slower economic growth over the longer term.\u201d The highest-temperature scenarios are SSP 4, in which inequality accelerates to even more grotesque levels, but advanced technology zaps some emissions, and SSP 5, where the world simply charges forward with fossil-fuel-powered turbo-capitalism. The path we seem to be on, at least for now, looks closer to SSP 2, which the authors call \u201cMiddle of the Road.\u201d This is a world in which \u201csocial, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns.\u201d A world, in other words, in which we do not heroically rise to the occasion to fix things, but in which we also don\u2019t get much worse than we already are. So what does this SSP 2 world feel like? It depends, O\u2019Neill told me, on who you are. One thing he wants to make very clear is that all the paths, even the hottest ones, show improvements in human well-being on average . IPCC scientists expect that average life expectancy will continue to rise, that poverty and hunger rates will continue to decline, and that average incomes will go up in every single plausible future, simply because they always have. \u201cThere isn\u2019t, you know, like a Mad Max scenario among the SSPs,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Climate change will ruin individual lives and kill individual people, and it may even drag down rates of improvement in human well-being, but on average, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re generally in the climate-change field not talking about futures that are worse than today.\u201d Read: Rivian wants to be the Apple of electric pickup trucks But all the current physical impacts of climate change\u2014drought, extreme heat, fire, storms, sea-level rise\u2014would get significantly worse by 2100 under SSP 2. And say goodbye to coral reefs. \u201cAt 2.5 degrees [Celsius], it\u2019s probably a world in which we don\u2019t have them,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist.\u201d The Arctic? \u201cMy guess is that we would have a permanently ice-free Arctic in the summer. And so we would have all of the ecological consequences that would come along with that.\u201d All the IPCC scenarios might be wrong. They\u2019re using statistical extrapolation and models, and as O\u2019Neill reminded me, history is always wilder than people expect. (Just as Mad Max scenarios are missing from the SSPs, so are \u201c no growth \u201d scenarios.) But the world we are heading toward may be one in which the average human is living longer and making more money than ever, but some vulnerable humans and many nonhumans are collateral damage. This is why many climate activists frame global warming as a problem of justice . John Paul Jose is a young climate activist based in Kerala, India, where a series of flash floods linked to climate change have killed hundreds of people since 2018 . \u201cIn all seasons throughout the year, there is cyclones, extreme rainfall and flood, heat waves,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the place where I live is an ecologically fragile and sensitive hill, an extension of Western Ghats. The immediate danger we have is of landslides and flooding in low-lying areas. So anything could happen in future; the only thing is to live in fear and hope.\u201d He wants to see drastic emissions cuts promised at COP26, along with serious money flowing from rich countries that have historically emitted the most toward poor communities where the impacts are the worst. At COP16, in 2010, wealthy nations promised to send $100 billion a year to \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d by 2020, but Oxfam International estimates that climate-specific net assistance is currently more like $20 billion a year. Climate advocates like Leah Stokes, a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara and an adviser to congressional Democrats on climate policy, are determined to find a way through this gray area. For her, the action that is happening is a motivation to push for even more action. \u201cIf they are able to pass this bill, it won\u2019t just be okay; it will be transformative,\u201d she told me. But there\u2019s more to do after the celebrations. \u201cThe climate crisis is not going to be solved in one bill. Every ton matters. Every dollar we get invested in this matters. It all adds up,\u201d she said. Fighting for incremental investment dollars is not as dramatic as a single sweeping intervention to avoid total planetary ruin, and activists moved by horrific visions of human extinction may not be as motivated by the quest to steer the globe from SSP 2 to SSP 1, to shave just a few degrees off the total average warming. But anyone who needs an apocalypse to focus on can rest assured that it\u2019s happening, unequally, for some. Even at today\u2019s 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, for many individual people, communities, and species, climate change has already meant the end of their world.","headline":"We\u2019re Heading Straight for a Demi-Armageddon","article_name":620605.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/how-bad-will-climate-change-get\/620605\/","date_published":"2021-11-03 17:24:44","article_length":7493,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:27.804279","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/how-bad-will-climate-change-get\/620605\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Democrats have figured out how to talk about climate change with urgency and air real differences among the candidates\u2019 ideas for dealing with it. How should Democrats even debate climate policy? It\u2019s a harder question than it may seem. Climate change is a sprawling, scary, cinematic problem, and its remedies involve the less-than-inspiring technical undergirding of society: stormwater management , the electrical grid, dirt . And dirt management will never be as engrossing as, say, Medicare for All. The party may also benefit, in a sort of shallow but undeniable way, from its monopoly on climate concern. Since any Democrat would do more to fight climate change than the current president, what\u2019s the point of airing dirty laundry about it in public? \u201cWe have all put out highly similar visions on climate,\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday night. \u201cWe will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency.\u201d Of course, there are lots of reasons to talk about it. Debates can inform the public about vital issues, as much as about the candidates, and on this topic, the Democrats running for president have real disagreements. This primary has taught them how to talk about those disputes in a way that is accessible, useful, and urgent. (And Buttigieg\u2019s claim that they share \u201chighly similar visions\u201d on climate, for instance, is more than a little self-serving: His campaign has been less specific about its own climate plans.) The biggest fissure last night had former Vice President Joe Biden on one side and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on the other. Biden\u2019s climate proposal aims for a \u201c100 percent clean-energy economy\u201d by 2050. It asks Congress to spend $1.7 trillion on new climate-friendly programs. Inslee\u2019s plan, by contrast, requires most of the economy to go 100 percent clean by 2030 , and it calls for $9 trillion in investment . Read: Do renewable-energy standards work? \u201cWe have to have a bold plan. And mine has been called the gold standard,\u201d Inslee said last night. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, specifically, called his plan the gold standard.) \u201cMiddle-ground solutions like the vice president has proposed or sort of average-sized things are not going to save us. Too little, too late is too dangerous,\u201d he added. Biden, who has proposed a legitimately ambitious climate policy, seemed thrown. The United States is responsible for only 15 percent of global carbon emissions, he said. For the other 85 percent, the world needs something that \u201cI helped negotiate \u2026 the Paris climate accord.\u201d He promised to \u201crejoin that accord, and I would make sure we up the ante. I would be able to bring those leaders together that I know and convene them in the White House, and I would raise the standard.\u201d His plan would also spend $400 billion on clean-energy R&D and build half a million charging stations for electric cars by 2030. Most of the candidates onstage then sided with Inslee. \u201cI have to agree with Governor Inslee,\u201d Senator Kamala Harris said at the start of her answer. She then quoted a line from his stump speech. A few minutes later, Senator Cory Booker made the same move. \u201cI want to take a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords. That is kindergarten.\u201d Booker then argued that every aspect of the U.S. government, from its trade deals to its economic policies, must center on climate change. (Inslee has already proposed plans advancing similar ideas.) \u201cThe majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we\u2019re going to deal with this is if the United States leads,\u201d Booker said. Read: Democrats try to resurrect the Paris Agreement Pursuing ambitious climate policy would have repercussions, and across the two evenings of debate, one of the clearest disagreements was about the right status for the fossil-fuel industry. Inslee argues that the oil and gas industry is the primary obstacle to taking climate action. Any attempt to reduce carbon emissions, he says, must address Big Oil\u2019s power head-on. Siding with him most clearly are Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Sanders went even further than Inslee on the first night of the debates. \u201cWhat do you do with an industry that knowingly\u2014for billions of dollars of short-term profits\u2014is destroying this planet?\u201d asked the senator from Vermont. \u201cI say that is criminal activity. That cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d Not everyone was won over by that antagonism. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, warned that demonizing fossil-fuel companies could also demonize their employees. John Hickenlooper, Colorado\u2019s governor, was skittish too. Biden, meanwhile, seems like he\u2019s trying to split the difference. A moderator asked, \u201cWould there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d Biden quickly replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Then he immediately amended that answer. \u201cWe would work it out,\u201d he said.","headline":"\u2018Nobody Should Get Applause for Rejoining the Paris Climate Accords\u2019","article_name":595276.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/pretty-good-democratic-debate-about-climate-change\/595276\/","date_published":"2019-08-01 11:00:55","article_length":5009,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:28.396376","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/pretty-good-democratic-debate-about-climate-change\/595276\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Scientists are struggling to figure out the timeline for how climate change will affect vulnerable waterfront communities. Between 1901 and 2010, global sea levels rose an average of 0.19 meters, or roughly seven inches. Over the next century, they\u2019ll continue to rise\u2014but at this point, that\u2019s one of the few things scientists know for certain. Less understood is how fast they\u2019ll rise, or where in the world these changes will be the most pronounced\u2014information that will be crucial in helping coastal communities adapt to climate change. \u201cThis is the burning question,\u201d said Andrea Dutton, an assistant professor of geology at University of Florida. \u201cHow quickly will the sea levels rise, and by how much?\u201d To figure it out, Dutton and other scientists across the United States are studying sea-level changes dating back 125,000 to 400,000 years ago, when global mean temperatures were 1.5 or two degrees Celsius higher than they are today. In some cases, the global mean sea levels during these eras peaked at 20-30 feet above present rates. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the planet is likely to reach those temperatures again by 2100\u2014which means understanding the past millennia could help researchers determine how best to protect vulnerable areas from the rising tides. The IPCC estimates a maximum 2.69-foot increase over the next hundred years or so, though other estimates are as high as three or four feet. In the meantime, some places have already begun to feel the impact. In southeast Florida, for example, four counties\u2014including Miami Dade and Palm Beach\u2014have formed a coalition called the Southeast Florida Regional Compact to develop strategies for problems like nuisance flooding, land subsidence, and saltwater intrusion into fresh water sources. Similar local efforts are taking place in the communities surrounding the Chesapeake Bay, and in other flooding hotspots around the country. \u201cPeople are demanding more regionalized information because local communities are being affected,\u201d said Benjamin Kirtman, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami. \u201cThe regional effects are very tricky, particularly here.\u201d But regional research will have to account for events with global implications:, including the likely eventual break-up, or deglaciation, of the West Antarctic ice sheet and the melting of Greenland. And right now, scientists don\u2019t have the data to understand how the changes in these massive ice sheets will affect sea levels worldwide, says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University. Scientists have approximated that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet alone could lead to a rise in global sea levels by up to 11 feet. Alley has modeled scenarios in which warming temperatures led the ice sheet to \u201cdevelop unstable cliffs and fracture rapidly, leading to rapid ice-sheet loss and sea-level rise.\u201d He compares the phenomenon to a fragile sand dune, susceptible to collapse. \u201cNot much research has been available to the IPCC on this topic. The uncertainties are large,\" said Alley. \u201cWhether a cliff is going to crumble or not is a hard thing to say.\u201d Putting together a complete picture of past different warm periods, ranging from about 11,700 to 5.3 million years ago, is no easy task, either. These eras, though distinct, all share certain commonalities, like temperatures and atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels on par with what we\u2019re experiencing today. Ben Horton, a professor of marine and coastal sciences at Rutgers University, co-authored an article with Dutton and others in Science last summer about sea-level rise during these time periods. \u201cThe geological record is very worrying,\u201d Horton said. Looking back 120,000 years, the temperature was two to three degrees Celsius higher than today\u2019s temperature\u2014what scientists project climate change could bring within the next century. For example, in the interglacial age 120,000 years ago, temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius higher than they are today, and sea levels were three to nine meters higher. Scientists project that within the next century, climate change could bring current temperatures up to levels on par with this period. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very big rise,\u201d Horton said Dutton recently received funding from the National Science Foundation to assess the rates of sea level rise around 125,000 years ago. Her project, like most research in this field, relies not on models, but instead on aged physical evidence\u2014in her case, coral samples collected from the Florida Keys, Mexico, and Western Australia. Since coral grows close to the sea surface, the different layers of coral fossil reflect their growth, age, and subsequently, contact with the ocean. This ocean life can help \u201cserve as a record for where sea level was,\u201d said Dutton. \u201cWe can measure the rates of sea level rise and see: Was it a gradual process, or did it jump quickly? Was it stable?\u201d she said. \u201cPart of the question is, did [this rise] happen in 1,000 years or less,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe want to get it down to plus or minus 50 years, but we might not be able to resolve anything less than that.\u201d Though sea level is a local issue, Australia\u2019s particular topographical dynamics during this time period would help it stand as an estimate for a global average. Maureen Raymo, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, studies the climate systems of past warm periods, including the Pliocene era (spanning 5.33 to 2.58 million years ago). She says that as climate science has come into sharper focus over the past five years, the idea of studying deep-time records has caught on within the climate-research community. \u201cI don\u2019t think 10 years ago scientists realized just how quickly the potential for rapid sea level rise was,\u201d Raymo said. At the southern tip of the United States, meanwhile, the Miami chapter of the Southeastern Florida Compact\u2014the local climate-change coalition composed of city officials, community members, and scientists\u2014is laying out city plans on five-year cycles. Anything further out may be rendered irrelevant by the rising seas. \u201cNobody knows what things are going to look like in 50 to 100 years,\u201d said Nicole Hefty, who heads up Miami-Dade county\u2019s office of sustainability. \u201cWe can speak for smaller years and adapt in that way.\u201d In the Chesapeake Bay area\u2014a flat region that\u2019s been sinking at a rate of 1.1 to 4.8 millimeters per year since the 1940s\u2014residents have recently begun preparing for the sea rise with a local pilot project in Norfolk, Virginia. Different working groups\u2014composed of climate scientists, citizens, and representatives from government and the private sector\u2014will develop recommendations for zoning and construction projects with an eye on sea-level rise and storm surge. This model could be replicated throughout the country, says Larry Atkinson, a professor at the Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography in Norfolk who consults for the pilot. But because projects like these depend on local funding and organizing, they can be challenging for some communities to develop. Horton has used his research of past sea-level fluctuations to develop regional projections of future sea-level rise. The more he and other scientists learn about the oceans of millennia ago, he says, the more confident they can be in their predictions about the near future. The research can also place current global warming in context, he adds. \u201cIt can show how unusual the 20th and 21st century [are], and that is very important as a public science education,\u201d he said. \u201cThis accelerated rate of sea-level rise has not been seen for over 2,000 years.\u201d","headline":"Preparing for the Inevitable Sea-Level Rise","article_name":471417.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/02\/rising-sea-levels\/471417\/","date_published":"2016-02-29 17:11:58","article_length":7686,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:29.150315","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/02\/rising-sea-levels\/471417\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Smearing soup on paintings is a stunt. What does real work look like? \u201cWhat is worth more: art or life?\u201d That was the provocative question that the demonstrator Phoebe Plummer asked onlookers at London\u2019s National Gallery last month. Seconds before, Plummer\u2014along with another activist\u2014had splattered tomato soup across Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers ,  superglued one hand to the wall, and kneeled in front of the painting, facing museumgoers in a shirt emblazoned with JUST STOP OIL . In the subsequent weeks, more climate activists defaced other famous works of art at museums across Europe in stunty attempts to draw attention to the climate crisis. \u201cA lot of people, when they saw us, had feelings of shock or horror or outrage,\u201d Plummer told NPR. \u201cWhere is that emotional response when it\u2019s our planet and our people that are being destroyed?\u201d The protesters may have succeeded in grabbing headlines, but their logic was puzzling. As my colleague Robinson Meyer has written , pitting concern for the climate against concern for protecting famous paintings makes little sense. In posing a false choice between art and the environment, the soup protesters backed themselves into a corner, attracting support from neither art lovers nor climate-movement sympathizers. Read: The climate art vandals are embarrassing A better connection between art and climate change exists, and the people who know this best are those who live and work at its intersection: the niche community known as eco-artists. Capturing the climate crisis in their work requires eco-artists to confront the daily realities of drought, heat, wildfires, and pollution. These conditions converge dramatically in the western states of the U.S., a region that has become synonymous with hazy tangerine skyscapes, charred remnants of forest, and cracked mosaic riverbeds. These images remind us that climate change is about loss\u2014of species, of livable conditions, of beauty. The climate crisis has inspired visual artists to create works that challenge viewers\u2014and themselves\u2014to move beyond shock and outrage, and toward action. In Colorado, where wildfires are increasing in both intensity and frequency, Anna Kaye has used the changing landscape as reference scenes for her drawings and paintings. After moving to the state in the mid-2000s, she has repeatedly visited the burn zones of the 2002 Hayman Fire\u2014one of the largest in Colorado\u2019s history\u2014to document the wreckage. In Kaye\u2019s watercolor Bluebird and Mountain Dandelion , abstract streaks of brown, black, and green stand in for a tree reshaped by fire, while a detailed mountain bluebird and an orange dandelion perch atop the branches. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see those slivers of grass that come back out and fight for life, and the roots that resprout and become new plants,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s power in witnessing that regeneration.\u201d In contrast with her vibrant, delicate watercolors of the flora and fauna that repopulate burn zones, Kaye has also created large-scale charcoal drawings of fires that she\u2019s witnessed, such as the Indian Gulch Fire , which destroyed 1,700 acres in 2011. \u201cFire is a challenging [subject] because with it comes trauma,\u201d she said. The resulting drawings inspire optimism less readily; instead, they navigate the friction between the grandeur and terror evoked by large-scale flames. For Kaye, painting and drawing are the practices that she believes allow her to process living through the climate crisis, but eco-art can also encompass music, poetry, dance, and literature. Perhaps America\u2019s most famous eco-artist is the writer Rachel Carson, whom many consider the mother of the modern environmental movement.\u00a0 In 1962, Carson\u2019s book Silent Spring laid out the harms that human pesticide use was wreaking on the natural world. But as Anelise Chen wrote in The Atlantic ,  Carson\u2019s body of work was equally focused on inspiring awe at nature\u2019s beauty. People need to feel invested in protecting what they love about the planet, not just sad about its destruction. Silent Spring \u2019s publication may have been a much-needed wake-up call 50 years ago. Today, many people already recognize that climate change is a serious , pressing issue , yet scientists warn that humanity is not moving fast enough to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis. Eco-artists are now faced with a new challenge: How do you move people past their fatigue and grief, and galvanize action? Read: What it would take to see the world completely differently Kim Abeles has made a career out of trying to answer that question. For 35 years, she has produced art from molecules of Los Angeles smog by layering stencils over glass, wood, or fabric outside on her studio\u2019s rooftop and allowing particulate matter to accumulate. Over time an image emerges, providing a snapshot of the air quality during a particular stretch of days, weeks, or months. Abeles refers to these works as \u201csmog collectors.\u201d One of her motivations, she told me, is to make visible the pollutants that people breathe into their lungs every day. Abeles\u2019s first smog collector, from 1987, traces the silhouette of the San Gabriel Mountains, 50 miles northwest from downtown L.A., which are often obscured by pollution. Over the decades that she\u2019s lived in the L.A. metro area, the mountains have continued to fade in and out of sight, a reminder that Abeles\u2019s work is never truly done. From the beginning, criticism has been a core objective of Abeles\u2019s smog collectors. Her 2019 addition, World Leaders in Smog, features smog portraits of 10 politicians alongside quotes from their environmental speeches, subverting the notion of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d in combatting climate change. Yes, every person can work to reduce their carbon footprint but, Abeles feels, those measures pale in comparison with the harms that governments and fossil-fuel companies inflict on the Earth. \u201cWorld leaders, corporate leaders\u2014they\u2019re individuals too,\u201d she said. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s portrait is accompanied by words from his 2017 speech withdrawing from the Paris climate accords: \u201cThe United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.\u201d More than just protest or condemnation, Abeles told me, she wants to use her art to achieve tangible outcomes. Beyond museums, she has displayed her smog collectors in community centers and other public spaces. In the \u201990s, the California Bureau of Automotive Repair commissioned her to create and display new smog collectors to encourage drivers to test their emissions and share rides. In another project, making smog collectors with Colorado middle schoolers, Abeles tried to encourage parents to stop idling their cars during afternoon pickup. \u201cTypical data and graphs\u2014how we\u2019re often given material\u2014doesn\u2019t ever hit the emotional part that we really need to tap into,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to decorate this problem,\u201d Abeles told me. Indeed, eco-art doesn\u2019t need to be housed in galleries or institutions to reach its intended audiences. For more than a decade, Michelle Glass has held textile workshops with residents of California\u2019s Central Valley, where some of the most polluted cities in the country are located and where poor air quality and water contamination have jeopardized residents\u2019 health. In recent years, the region has had the highest rates of asthma and asthma-related hospitalizations in the state. Like Abeles\u2019s smog collectors, Glass\u2019s works (made of natural dyes and fibers) strive to educate residents about the environmental harms in their backyards and then move them toward change. In her workshops, Glass uses local plants and tap water to dye fabrics\u2014relying on the environment itself as the medium. She told me she finds art to be the most effective way to communicate with the women who attend her workshops\u2014many of whom are older immigrants from Mexico\u2014because it transcends language barriers. \u201cYou get the color story of the land. If you\u2019re living in a healthy environment, the colors will be very rich and vibrant,\u201d Glass said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not \u2026 those colors will be very muted and dull.\u201d In early 2020, Glass started working on a project titled We Are Here\/Estamos Aqu\u00ed in collaboration with several environmental-justice organizations. Their goal was to make residents conscious of the dangers of living with pollution, and to harness that awareness into individual- and policy-level changes. More than 2 million California residents live within 2,500 feet (nearly half a mile) of an oil or gas well; the Central Valley\u2019s Kern County, where Glass works, produces more than 70 percent of the state\u2019s oil. Living near oil production sites can be hazardous to residents, with drilling exposing them to increased concentrations of air pollutants and wastewater from oil extraction contaminating groundwater sources. When this project started, the organizations had spent nearly 10 years lobbying state legislators to create a buffer zone between oil drills and residential communities without success. Photos: The urban oil fields of Los Angeles Over the past two years, Glass and the workshop participants created more than 400 fabric panels stretching 2,500 feet: the distance of their proposed setback. They used reds, yellows, and greens\u2014the colors of the air-quality index\u2014and, on Earth Day this year, carried the tapestry in a procession along the Kern River Oil Field. Glass told me that though she believed the demonstration was a culminating moment, the workshops were equally meaningful, as residents learned the truth about their environment, reflected on ways they could reduce their own climate footprints, and contacted their representatives. In September, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill that will create a buffer zone of 3,200 feet between new oil wells and residents. The California Independent Petroleum Association has already raised $8 million to try to reverse the legislation. \u201cThe oil and gas companies and the large businesses are banking on the fact that we\u2019re going to get tired,\u201d Glass said. But because Glass and other eco-artists believe that the well-being of entire communities and the planet is at stake, they\u2019re committed to pressing ahead. The climate museum protesters don\u2019t seem to be stopping anytime soon, either. Just this past Friday , activists threw flour over a sports car painted by Andy Warhol in Milan. As they become more frequent, the novelty of the museum protests will fade. Creating art, though, can still be a useful tool for the climate movement. \u201cIf you just alarm people or critique, we\u2019re only complaining,\u201d Abeles told me. \u201cYou have to give people somewhere to go.\u201d","headline":"The Other Climate-Change Art Protest","article_name":672185.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/11\/eco-artists-climate-change-museum-protests\/672185\/","date_published":"2022-11-20 12:00:00","article_length":10691,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:29.310661","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/11\/eco-artists-climate-change-museum-protests\/672185\/","source":"atlantic"}

Every Tuesday, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . In January 2020, Boris Khentov attended a climate protest in Washington, D.C., led by Jane Fonda. (She was, at its climax, arrested.) Its theme was the role of financial institutions in the climate crisis, and the speakers\u2014who included Joaquin Phoenix, Martin Sheen, and the environmental author Bill McKibben\u2014stressed one idea over and over again: divestment. Financial institutions needed to stop investing in fossil-fuel companies, they said, for society to have a shot at fighting climate change. For the past decade, divestment has been the climate movement\u2019s biggest demand of banks, pension funds, and university endowments, an echo of earlier campaigns against apartheid and Big Tobacco . \u201cAs we marched together towards the Capitol, one phrase ran through my mind,\u201d Khentov later told me in an email: \u201c\u2018If only it were that simple.\u2019\u201d Khentov is not an expert in climate change, but he does know something about finance. He is the senior vice president of operations at Betterment, a software company that advises people on how best to manage their money. Betterment is what\u2019s called a robo-adviser: It offers consumers a few portfolios of stocks and bonds, then automatically shifts how assets in a portfolio are \u201cweighted\u201d for each customer\u2019s goals, so that a 30-year-old, say, has more stocks in her retirement fund than a 60-year-old. It has about half a million customers and $22 billion under management. Divestment wasn\u2019t wrong ,  Khentov thought, but it was inadequate. The fight against climate change requires transforming the physical stuff of the world\u2014its engines, refineries, foundries, everything we call economic infrastructure \u2014in the next 30 years. That would require more than just an oil change, so to speak. It would require changing every company\u2014including Betterment. The protest led him to create something that, as far as I know, is unique among major 401(k) providers and robo-advisers: a specifically climate -focused portfolio. (This week he published a blog post explaining what went into making it .) Any American can invest in it, including with a retirement account such as a Roth IRA. (Before we get any further, I should specify: Nothing in this column constitutes financial advice.) Even if you don\u2019t have any retirement savings, the new Betterment climate portfolio is worthy of your attention, I think. Unlike many would-be pro-climate investment products, it represents a sincere attempt to think through what will actually change the economy . To very quickly catch you up, there are two big trends in investing circa 2021. The first is that investors are choosing broad, low-fee, diversified funds that track the overall market rather than searching for the very few companies that do disproportionately well. The second is the laudable but frankly kind of nebulous idea that people want to invest in line with their values. This is usually called investing for \u201cenvironmental, social, and governance,\u201d or ESG, funds. Over the past few years, hundreds of billions have poured into ESG funds . Betterment has promoted and boosted these two trends. Its \u201ccore\u201d portfolio tracks major indices, and, in 2017, it launched an ESG-inspired portfolio . ESG funds are seen as inherently climate-friendly, but they\u2019re really not\u2014or, at least, they usually have a broader ambit than climate alone. Many ESG funds track companies based on how well they perform on a scorecard, which might look at a firm\u2019s carbon footprint alongside questions of \u201cgood corporate governance\u201d that climate-focused investors don\u2019t necessarily care about. Some ESG funds invest more in companies if they have a woman on the board of directors\u2014which is a worthwhile idea, except that ExxonMobil\u2019s board has three . The basic idea of ESG is good, though\u2014and, I would add, goes to the heart of what retirement means in the first place. Perhaps for older readers\u2014and I mean this with no slight\u2014the middle decades of the 21st century remain notional. But I, God willing, would like to celebrate my 59th birthday in 2050, and under current law, I have to start taking money from my 401(k) in 2063. That\u2019s about the same time that 90 percent of the world\u2019s coral reefs will be at risk of destruction , and when much of California\u2019s forestland will be giving way to scrub, grassland, and desert. The premise of retirement is that I will one day get to enjoy the 2060s, but it will take some societal work to make the 2060s enjoyable. I would like my (for now, meager) retirement savings to enable such work. I am, apparently, not alone. In October, Betterment split its new climate-focused portfolio from its main ESG offering. Within three weeks of launch, it passed $100 million in total assets\u2014\u201cfar faster than any brand-new portfolio in Betterment\u2019s 10-year history,\u201d Khentov wrote. The median investor in the climate portfolio is three years younger than the median Betterment customer. What are those investors getting? After he came home from the protest, Khentov began a months-long research effort to improve Betterment\u2019s climate portfolio. \u201cLiterally every single sector, every single business, has a CO 2 emissions profile,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHow do we incorporate the fact that these oil and gas companies are pumping, and these utilities are burning, to serve [other] companies? Every business has a carbon profile and very few have fossil-fuel reserves.\u201d What was needed was another approach\u2014call it divestment-plus. He and his colleagues decided to divide the new Betterment portfolio into three parts. The first is divestment. Betterment devotes about half of its stock portfolio to exchange-traded funds that track large-cap companies that have no oil, gas, or coal reserves. So Microsoft is here, but no Exxon. Google, but no Chevron. Yet pipeline manufacturers are here too, because even though they trade in fossil fuels, they don\u2019t own underground reserves. The second approach is what he calls \u201coptimization.\u201d Betterment commits the other half of its stock portfolio to a fund called CRBN , which elevates companies that have the smallest ratio of carbon emissions per dollar in their respective sector. That is, it finds the cleanest companies in each industry, and \u201cvotes\u201d for them with dollars. The final approach is to invest in \u201cgreen bonds,\u201d through\u00a0 a fund called BGRN . These bonds directly finance climate-friendly investments, such as new renewable projects. None of these strategies is perfect. The divestment stocks \u201cclearly represent that energy and emotion that I saw when I was protesting,\u201d Khentov said, but because most companies raise money by issuing bonds , divestment from shares may not significantly raise the cost they pay for capital. The optimization approach isn\u2019t ideal either, because these index funds pick the lowest-carbon companies in every sector, including the energy sector. And the green-bond industry remains hopelessly unregulated, so it\u2019s hard to know whether your dollars are funding truly pro-climate projects. (Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could step in soon .) The optimization problem in particular troubles Justin Guay , a climate-finance activist and the director of global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project. Companies solely devoted to fossil fuels should have no place in a climate portfolio, he told me. \u201cSome companies need to die as part of the energy transition, while others need to evolve into birds,\u201d he said. Khentov argues that a \u201cbest in class\u201d index, such as CRBN, could open up a new age of what he calls \u201cindex activism.\u201d Companies are desperate to get on crucial stock-market indexes\u2014when Tesla made the S&P 500 earlier this year, it was interpreted as a coronation \u2014because they raise the share price, and because they act as a de facto vote of confidence for management. If CRBN attracted enough investor money, he said, then simply wanting to remain on its index could become a pressure point for a company\u2019s executives. They might undertake more ambitious decarbonization plans to stay ahead of their competitors, driving what the political scientist Sarah Manina Kelsey calls a \u201cgreen spiral\u201d of positive behavior. Or maybe not: Either way, the Betterment portfolio is, Khentov admits, an experiment. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible to put together this climate portfolio a year ago, he said, and it\u2019s possible that next year, even better climate-focused funds will be available for his team to add to its portfolio. The next frontier, for instance, may be investing in a fund that promises to get involved in disputes between investors and management over climate plans. But right now, no such fund exists. When I talked to Guay, the activist, he homed in on\u2014and complimented\u2014an aspect of Betterment\u2019s design that I hadn\u2019t noticed. When an investor opens a fund on Betterment\u2019s website, the user interface puts its \u201ccore\u201d portfolio on the same tier as its socially responsible portfolios, including its climate portfolio. \u201cThat is different. That is fundamentally different than most retirement advisers,\u201d he said. Fidelity, for instance, provides no divested portfolio options for its 401(k) customers. The next step, he said, was for the climate-friendly portfolio to become the default. \u201cOptions are all well and good \u2026 but you\u2019ll never get there by consumer choice alone,\u201d he said, citing research that organ-donation programs are more successful when they\u2019re opt-out. \u201cThe problem can\u2019t fall on the shoulders of consumers.\u201d Thanks for reading.

{"id":null,"body":"A 765,000-person study argues that unusually warm nights are a public-health hazard. In the fall of 2015, the worst heatwave in 25 years struck Southern California. Los Angeles saw two back-to-back 100-degree days, which set an October record and plagued the Long Beach marathon. San Diego, meanwhile, cooked in monthly temperatures 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual. But the real weird weather came at night. For more than a week, San Diego\u2019s nighttime low barely fell below 75 degrees, even in the coolest hours before dawn. It remains the hottest string of October nights ever recorded in the city. Nick Obradovich remembers the heat grimly. As a graduate student at the University of California San Diego, his window AC unit couldn\u2019t keep his apartment cool, nor could he afford to keep it running most of the time. His bedroom got hotter and hotter as he tossed and turned through the night. As he lay awake, he wondered if other people were going through the same thing. Yes\u2014and they still are, he and his colleagues now argue. The first paper examining the link between climate change and human sleep, published Friday in Science Advances , finds that high nighttime temperatures drive more self-reported sleep problems. Elderly people, and people making less than $50,000 per year, seem especially affected by the trend. The study draws on data from the largest survey of its kind: a 765,000-person telephone survey conducted between 2002 and 2011 by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors then compared those answers\u2014which included a respondent\u2019s location and income\u2014to heat waves during the same period. \u201cWhen you have anomalously warm nights in the summer, you have increases in reported sleep difficulties,\u201d Obradovich says. Anomalously warm nights are one of the earliest symptoms of human-caused climate change. For the past 10,000 years, the same daily cycle has played out: The sun\u2019s heat streams into the atmosphere during the day, and then much of it radiates back into space at night. But greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap that heat and reflect it back into the Earth system, keeping ambient temperatures high even at night. Obradovich argues that these warmer nights are worsening sleep at a physiological level. \u201cWe know from a broad literature in the laboratory context that our sleep is regulated pretty heavily by our body temperature\u2014and especially by our core body temperature. The [ambient] temperature in a lab setting can affect someone\u2019s sleep quality,\u201d he says. Previous public-health studies have found that heat waves raise mortality levels among older people. Obradovich suggests that one cause of this elevated mortality could be poorer sleep quality. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant use of secondary data,\u201d says Jeanne Geiger-Brown, the dean of the school of health professions at Stevenson University and a long-time researcher of the epidemiology of sleep. She was not connected to this study. \u201cThe federal government collects data for a variety of things and this particular use of the Behavior Risk Factors Survey \u2014and to link it with the climate data\u2014is very, very innovative. I give them a lot of credit for that.\u201d Geiger-Brown cautioned that, \u201cas is true of all studies that use secondary data, you can only work with the data you have.\u201d The two most common causes of self-reported poor sleep quality are sleep disorders, like sleep apnea, and the lack of a comfortable, dark place to rest and the ability to spend seven hours there. \u201cJust because of nature of the data, elderly people are more likely to have sleep disorders. And on the converse side, they found people with lower incomes were more susceptible to having this [heatwave-caused] effect\u2014but they often have to work two jobs to make a living wage,\u201d and thus tend to lack sleep opportunity, Geiger-Brown said. In other words, low-income people and older folks are the groups of Americans most likely to have sleep problems, generally. The data offers other benefits, though. It studies a much more diverse population than a clinical trial would normally allow, Geiger-Brown said. \u201cIt really is a representative sample of the United States, and you can\u2019t get that in the clinical setting. That\u2019s what makes this so powerful.\u201d The most confronting consequences of the research may not even apply in an American setting. While the best evidence for this kind of study comes from the U.S., the consequences of climate-addled sleep could be far worse in less-studied parts of the world: namely, those that get hotter at night or have fewer air-conditioning units. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that the effects we see in the U.S. represent some kind of lower bound for what we might observe in poorer countries that are hotter on average,\u201d Obradovich says.

{"id":null,"body":"From the increase in frequency of heatwaves to the spread of infectious diseases, changing weather patterns are already affecting us all The consequences of climate change sometimes appear far off. But warming and changing weather patterns are already driving changes in public health. The following are seven ways in which climate change affects you and your well-being. Heatwaves Heatwaves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration throughout the world. The nature of heatwaves is also affected by climate change. Nighttime temperatures have been climbing twice as fast as average temperatures since 1970, meaning less relief at night. (When the temperatures at night don't fall in farm country, the cows go down. The same holds true for us.) In addition, the warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor -- seven percent more for each one-degree Celsius warming -- raising humidity levels, thus heat indices, which determine how we feel during a heatwave. The combination of factors make heatwaves today all the more lethal, and the consequences include cardiorespiratory illness, and dehydration and diarrhea in children. Thousands have lost their lives in recent heatwaves in Europe, Russia, and India, for example. Asthma and Allergies The total number of asthma sufferers in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1980 and several exacerbating factors stem from burning fossil fuels. Increased carbon dioxide (CO2) and warming both boost pollen production from fast-growing trees in the spring and ragweed in the fall. The allergenic proteins in the pollen become stronger with higher levels of CO2. You may have observed that poison ivy is proliferating. Increased CO2 also stimulates poison ivy growth and boosts the chemical within it (uruschiol) that causes the contact dermatitis. Small particulates from burning fossil fuels (e.g., diesel, coal), in addition to clogging our airways, attach to pollen and mold spores and help deliver them deep inside our lung sacs. Furthermore, ground-level ozone -- photochemical smog, chiefly from other tail pipe emissions -- injures the lung linings and primes the allergic response. The reaction that forms ozone also increases during heatwaves. Meanwhile, climate change has extended the allergy and asthma season two to four weeks in the Northern Hemisphere (depending on latitude) since 1970. In addition to the anxious suffering induced by asthma, the loss of school days and lost productivity attributable to asthma in the U.S. cost us $56 billion in 2007 -- and that number continues to climb. Spread of Infectious Diseases Climate change encourages the spread of infectious diseases in two ways: Warming expands the geographic conditions conducive to transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) while extreme events often leave clusters of mosquito-, water - and rodent-borne diseases (and spread toxins). First, mosquito-borne diseases are appearing higher in the mountains of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, precisely where glaciers are retreating and plant communities are migrating upward. (Mountains are superb laboratories for studying climate change, because of their verticality. One can go from desert to tropical to polar conditions in just five miles.) Today, Malaria is circulating in the Nairobi, a mile high city; malaria has occurred high in the mountains of Bolivia; and dengue fever is spreading throughout the highlands of Vietnam. In the U.S., tick-borne Lyme disease (LD) is the most important VBD. Its range is increasing as winters warm. LD case reports rose eight-fold in New Hampshire in the past decade and 10-fold in Maine (and today include all of its 16 counties). Babesiosis, or animal malaria, also carried by ticks, is growing in the northeast and threatens the blood supply. Warmer winters and disproportionate warming toward the poles mean that the changes in range are occurring faster than models (based on average temperatures) projected. Biological responses of vectors and plants to warming are, in general, underestimated and may be seen as leading indicators of warming due to the disproportionate winter and high-latitude warming. Note: While temperatures have risen in the U.S. some one-degree Fahrenheit in the past century, those in Maine have gone up 1.4 degrees and winters have warmed three degrees. On the other side of the continent the changes are even more dramatic. Alaska's temperature has risen 3.4 degrees while its winters have risen 6.4 degrees, bringing in stinging insects (wasps), mosquitoes, and pine bark beetles, all while melting tundra and coastal inundations are forcing communities to relocate, causing untold emotional and mental stress. Then, to extreme events. Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and their very nature is intensified by global warming. With the warmed atmosphere holding more water vapor and the warming ocean the repository for the last century's global warming, rain is coming down with increasing intensity across the continual U.S. The yearly amount has increased seven percent overall since 1970, while two-inch\/day rains, four-inch\/day rains, and six-inch\/day rains have increased 14 percent, 20 percent, and 27 percent, respectively. Rains in the U.S. over two-inches\/day are associated with E. coli and cryptosporidium infections. Heavy rains and flooding can also spread toxic chemicals and leave new breeding sites for mosquitoes. Pests and Diseases Affecting Forests, Crops, Marine Life Pests and diseases affecting forests, crops, and marine life are also encouraged in a warmer world. Bark beetles are over wintering (absent sustained killing frosts) and moving to higher latitudes and altitudes, and getting in more generations each year from Arizona to Alaska. Drought in the west also affects tree resistance, drying the resin in the bark that normally drowns the beetles as they try to drive through. While bark beetles are a natural part of the ecology of forests, consuming dead stands and recycling nutrients, warming and extremes have upset this balance, negotiated over millennia, emboldening the pests while weakening the hosts. Forest health is also threatened in the Northeast U.S. Asian Long-horned beetles could spread with warmer winters. Today, the wooly adelgid -- an aphid-like insect -- is decimating Eastern hemlock trees in New England, altering stream quality, and increasing the potential for wildfires (that cause injury, air pollution, death, and property loss, plus tons of carbon released, and damage to oxygen and clean water supplies.) Crop pests and diseases are also aided by warming and extremes. Warming increases their potential range, while floods foster fungal growth and droughts favor aphids, locusts, and viral-infecting whiteflies. Higher CO2 stimulates growth of agricultural weeds. The combination of more pests, diseases, and weeds may require more pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides (where available) for control, increasing the chemical threats to human health. Globally, crop pests, pathogens, and weeds take up to 40 percent of yield annually, amounting to some $300 billion in losses on global markets. Marine diseases (e.g., coral bleaching and sea urchin die-offs) are spreading in the coastal environment. Algae -- dubbed \"the vegetables of the sea\" by Rachel Carson -- absorb nutrients and CO2. Toxin-producing harmful algal blooms (HABs) proliferate with excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), loss of coastal wetlands (that filter nutrients out), and warmer seas. Extreme weather events (especially flooding) trigger HABs by flushing nutrients into estuaries and coastal waters. \"Dead zones\" -- areas with low and no oxygen from persistent HABs -- are proliferating. The over 350 around the world affect fisheries, nutrition, economies, and health. (The one in the Gulf of Mexico doubles in size after flooding along the Mississippi, as farm nitrogen run-off feeds the algae.) Some HABs, including some in New England, contain toxins that contaminate shell-fish and can lead to human illness and the closure of shell-fish beds. Algal and zooplankton blooms can also harbor microbes, including species of Vibrio bacteria. The outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis (a cousin of Vibrio cholerae, the cause of cholera) in cruise-ship travelers in 2004 from eating oysters harvested in warm Alaskan waters extended the northernmost documented source of oysters causing V. parahaemolyticus illness by 600 miles. Mean daily water temperatures exceeded the threshold of 15 degrees Celsius or 63 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter Weather Anomalies With warmer winters overall, more precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow in the Northern Hemisphere, increasing the chances for ice storms. Additionally, more atmospheric moisture nourishes heavy snowfalls. Warming oceans and melting Arctic ice lie at the heart of polar leakage of cold air and altered patterns of the Jet Stream have affected U.S. and European winters for the past two years. Ice storms and heavy snow storms affect ambulatory health (orthopedics), and can lead to motor vehicle accidents, exacerbate cardiac disease, and cause power outages with accompanying health effects. Melting of heavy snowpack this past spring contributed to flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Drought Droughts are increasing in frequency, intensity, duration, and geographic extent. Drought and water stress are major killers in developing nations, and are associated with disease outbreaks, including water-borne cholera and mosquito-borne dengue fever (mosquitoes breed in stored water containers around houses). Droughts and dead stands from forest pests, plus more unstable wind patterns from altered temperatures and pressures, all contribute to the rising incidence and toll of forest fires. Drought can directly lead to illness: Dengue fever has been on the rise in the Caribbean, where water stored in containers and left in tires and vases provide micro-breeding sites. In Africa's Sahel, meningitis outbreaks increase as mucus membranes dry. Drought and higher CO2 also contribute to food-borne illness, as they increase the cyanide content of cassava, a staple food in Africa. Cyanide-intoxication leads to neurological disabilities and death. Food Insecurity Food insecurity is suddenly a major problem worldwide. Demand for meat, fuel prices, and displacement of food crops with those grown for biofuels, all contribute. But extreme weather events today are the acute driver. Numerous extreme weather events are boosting grain prices and causing shortages in many nations. Food shortages and price hikes contribute to malnutrition that underlies much of poor health and vulnerability to infectious diseases. Food insecurity can also lead to political instability, conflict, and war. Climate change has multiple implications for human health. Some of the impacts are direct (e.g., from heatwaves), and some are indirect (via disease vectors). The most profound implications for human health, however, lie with the impacts of climate change on the ecological systems -- our life support systems -- that underlie our health and well-being.

{"id":null,"body":"During the summer of 1924, workers at a refinery in Bayway, N.J., started to get sick. First, they complained of irritability, insomnia, and memory loss. Symptoms progressed to convulsions and collapse. Then tragedy struck: Five workers died from lead poisoning. By the fall, the plant\u2014which produced a new gasoline additive containing lead\u2014had been shut down. But companies continued to sell lead as an additive to gasoline and an ingredient in household paint for years to come, with little attention paid to its deadly side effects. What does all this have to do with global warming? The lead industry distorted the public debate over the lethal metal using many of the tactics that the fossil-fuel industry employs to stir up controversy over climate change, according to three science historians who spoke Thursday on Capitol Hill. \"This is a cautionary tale of what happens when an industry learns about the bad things it has done, and tries to cover them up,\" said Columbia professor David Rosner, who coauthored the book Lead Wars: The Politics of Science and the Fate of America's Children with CUNY professor Gerald Markowitz. Rosner and Markowitz made their case at an event hosted by the Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change. The event was moderated by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Henry Waxman of California, both Democrats. According to Rosner, the lead industry systematically denied that its product posed a threat to public health starting in 1914. Scientists on the industry's payroll churned out studies to refute evidence that lead exposure causes illness and, in extreme cases, death. The industry also waged a marketing war to boost the popularity of their product, Rosner and Markowitz said. Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes, the author of Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco to Global Warming , said at the same event that\u00a0the fossil-fuel industry has followed a similar playbook to halt political action on climate change. According to Oreskes, industry-funded think tanks like the George C. Marshall Institute and the Heartland Institute have sowed seeds of doubt that have spurred debate over whether human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Peer-reviewed studies indicate that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and man-made. Here's how the Marshall Institute's website describes the science behind global warming: \"Human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels to power our homes and businesses and changes to the land caused by the rise of modern cities and expanded agriculture, undoubtedly affect the global environment. It is the extent of that effect and how it relates to changes in the modern climate which is the subject of current scientific debate.\" It's not climate denial, but the statement suggests uncertainty over whether human activity has caused global warming. That, the academics say, is the problem. \"This isn't a coincidence, it was part of a strategy, and today we're seeing the results of that strategy,\" Oreskes said, referring to the fact that a congressional push for policy to address global warming stalled during the president's first term after some segments of the fossil-fuel industry lobbied to kill the legislation. The Marshall Institute and Heartland have refuted Oreskes's claims, saying that the allegations lack integrity and logic. William O'Keefe and Jeff Kueter, the Marshall Institute's CEO and president, respectively, published a lengthy critique in 2010 of Oreskes's book. \u00a0\"Merchants of Doubt is long on innuendo and short on evidence,\" the critique states. \"It fits well with Mark Twain's classic observation about gathering facts and then distorting them as the gatherer desires.\" Heartland has also criticized the science history professor. \"Oreskes can name virtually no significant funding for skeptics,\" a post on the think tank's website states. \"Skeptics are almost all unpaid volunteers, working out of professional and patriotic duty, appalled by the illogical, anti-science sentiments of people like Oreskes.\"","headline":"What Lead Paint Has to Do With Climate Change","article_name":443691.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/what-lead-paint-has-to-do-with-climate-change\/443691\/","date_published":"2014-09-18 14:34:00","article_length":4124,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:30.990036","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/09\/what-lead-paint-has-to-do-with-climate-change\/443691\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The ranking reveals a sad reality: People are really bored right now, and that leaves a lot of room for mediocre content to flourish. Last summer, I made a grievous mistake while getting my hair braided. As I eased into the chair, mentally preparing myself (well, my glutes) for the hours-long process ahead, I looked up and asked my stylist an idle question: What have you been watching on Netflix lately? She launched into an explanation of her latest binge watch, and by the time the lower quadrant of my hair was sectioned off into plaits, I\u2019d somehow become invested in the story of a protagonist whose description I can\u2019t believe is real, even now. The cynically named CW series In the Dark follows a blind 20-something woman named Murphy Mason, whose penchant for drinking and vacuous sexual encounters is rivaled only by her determination to solve the disappearance of her teenage friend Tyson, a drug dealer with a heart of gold who once saved her from a violent mugging. The series is a chaotic m\u00e9lange of genre clich\u00e9s with some earnest moments sprinkled in, which is to say it\u2019s a natural Netflix hit. Sure enough, the first season of In the Dark  found a larger audience after the streaming platform picked it up, and since last week, the newly released Season 2 has bounced around Netflix\u2019s Top 10 most watched list. A relatively new feature, the list offers a glimpse into what other users in the same country are gravitating toward on any given day. As the coronavirus pandemic has hamstrung the production and release of new entertainment, the Top 10 list has become an oddly influential tastemaker. Did I expect a preponderance of Netflix subscribers to be so eager to find out what happened to Murphy and Tyson? Not really\u2014but I\u2019m not surprised to see it. The list is regularly dominated by the kinds of shows and movies best described as \u201cthings to play in the background while you scroll on your phone.\u201d Even if intriguing projects do make it onto the Top 10, it can be hard to tell the names apart. According to Netflix, U.S. viewers are currently obsessed with In the Dark and Dark Desire , Last Chance U and The Last Dance , The Kissing Booth and The Kissing Booth 2 . Sometimes, sensational titles spend weeks in the No. 1 spot, such as the erotic drama 365 Days , which titillated touch-starved viewers with its sexual hijinks . But the makeup of such rankings reflects a rather banal truth: People are really bored right now, and that leaves a lot of room for uninspired content to flourish. Read: Netflix\u2019s accidental coup If HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones was the last great piece of TV monoculture , then the pandemic has popularized a series of forgettable productions that each offers a fleeting, miniature facsimile of communal attention. Absent the usual summer blockbusters , and with few prestige shows rolling out new episodes, the landscape of American entertainment is barren enough for C- shows and movies to rack up the viewership of B+ productions, if not the associated enthusiasm. The mechanism by which Netflix measures its subscribers\u2019 consumption habits is itself a paragon of low expectations. The company, which has historically withheld actual audience numbers, recently revealed that it counts anything longer than two minutes spent on one movie or show\u2019s screen as a \u201cview.\u201d Whether because of the content\u2019s mediocrity , or the sheer exhaustion brought on by living through a historical event , few of these \u201cmost watched\u201d works have generated a collective viewing experience that feels cohesive, much less exhilarating. What is there to text a friend about the way that Murphy Mason trips over herself in every other In the Dark scene because the show is hell-bent on reminding viewers that she is, in fact, blind? Even while trapped in a braiding chair for upwards of eight hours, I had nothing to say about it. That Fatal Affair , the new Perfect Stranger \u2013esque thriller starring Nia Long and Omar Epps, would go largely unremarked upon by Black Twitter\u2014despite putting up a decent showing on the most-popular list\u2014felt symptomatic of this broader apathy, too: How, I wondered while watching that movie, had Netflix found a way to make me yearn for the days when the worst thing a Long character did was date a slam poet with a hoop earring ? Still, no production better captures the unbearable adequacy of such offerings than Netflix\u2019s Kissing Booth franchise. The second film in the series has been planted firmly at the top end of the most-popular list since its release last week, even dragging the original into the ranking with it. The Kissing Booth cinematic universe, which includes another forthcoming film, is a world of middling teenage romantic hijinks that make me\u2014a noted and very forgiving fan of the genre\u2014contemplate never kissing anyone again. \u201cNo boobs are worth a broken nose,\u201d a line uttered by one of the characters in the first film, has haunted me since I first heard it. Read: The most-watched show in America is a moral failure That\u2019s not to say everything that\u2019s been popular on Netflix, or other streaming services, has been tiresome or unremarkable. Tiger King , the morally bankrupt cat-breeding documentary series , took over the platform at the end of March, but an adaptation of the beloved Baby-Sitters Club book series released in June was a genuine delight . Of course, the proliferation of second-rate content predates the pandemic: Who could forget Bird Box , the baffling Sandra Bullock thriller that raked in viewers largely because of its memeability? (I can, thankfully.) No matter how eye-roll-worthy the premise or execution of these productions, I understand their appeal. There\u2019s something inordinately comforting about letting the algorithm decide for you, relinquishing the burden of choice to an external force. There\u2019s a kind of utility in lists that do that and offer a window into what shows other, similarly stressed people are letting wash over them, if only for two minutes. Even outside of the stylist\u2019s chair, I\u2019m still a captive audience\u2014and so are you.","headline":"Netflix\u2019s \u2018Most Popular\u2019 List Is a Wasteland","article_name":614845.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2020\/07\/netflixs-most-popular-list-is-a-wasteland\/614845\/","date_published":"2020-07-31 16:08:14","article_length":6058,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:31.544244","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/culture\/archive\/2020\/07\/netflixs-most-popular-list-is-a-wasteland\/614845\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Activists are pushing educators to teach that human-caused global warming is an opinion\u2014rather than a fact\u2014by issuing textbook ratings of their own. \"As the amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase, the Earth warms. Scientists warn that climate change, caused by this warming, will pose challenges to society.\" That language\u2014featured in a fifth-grade Texas social studies textbook from Pearson Education\u2014is exactly the kind of global-warming alarmism that Emily McBurney wants to protect schoolchildren from. McBurney was a lot happier with an earlier version of the textbook that said, \"Scientists disagree about what is causing climate change.\" But the publisher cut the material amid pressure from groups like the National Center for Science Education. The edited educational material, McBurney says, amounts to \"a one-sided global-warming climate-change agenda.\" McBurney is a member of the Truth in Texas Textbooks coalition, a volunteer-run organization of more than 100 activists that wants global warming to be taught as an opinion rather than fact. \"If you're a car salesman and you have a car that has bad ratings, that car is not going to sell,\" says Roy White, the founder of Truth in Texas Textbooks and a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel. \"That is what is going to happen with these books.\" To shape climate curriculum, the coalition plans to rate textbooks as \"good,\" \"acceptable,\" \"poor,\" or \"worse.\" The group will score books on an array of subjects\u2014and any educational material that treats global warming as settled science is guaranteed to get low marks. Truth in Texas Textbooks formed last year to shape how climate change and scores of other topics are taught. It has no political or religious affiliation but organizers recruit volunteers through tea-party networks and church groups\u2014as well as teachers associations, Rotary clubs, and other civic organizations\u2014and have accused publishers of creating textbooks with an \"anti-Christian\" and \"anti-American\" bias. Teaching that the global-warming theory is controversial reflects public opinion, as there is a sharp divide over the connection between human activity and Earth's evolving climate. But that approach is sharply at odds with climate scientists, who nearly universally believe the former is driving the latter. Textbooks are often the first conduit between climate science and young people. The books that the Texas truth coalition is fighting over are expected to be used by more than 5 million Texas public school students for at least a decade. Texas is also the second-largest market for textbooks behind California, and publishers often peddle best-selling Texas textbooks in other states. And that's not all: The coalition's system of rating textbooks could soon spread beyond Texas. White says that activists in California, Florida, Indiana, Maine, Nevada, Ohio, Utah, and Wisconsin have already contacted the coalition to learn how they can create their own rating system. Advocacy groups giving grades to Texas textbooks is not novel: A conservative Christian organization called Educational Research Analysts has been rating educational material in the state since the 1960s. The group questions scientific evidence for evolution and supports education that promotes abstinence until marriage. Educational Research Analysts also has ties to the Texas truth coalition: Its president, Neal Frey, advised White as he worked to get Truth in Texas Textbooks off the ground. But Educational Research Analysts hasn't worked on climate science, which is a targeted area for Truth in Texas Textbooks. So far, however, the group has struggled. The coalition faced a setback when the Texas Board of Education voted last month to adopt new social-studies textbooks for public schools. Ahead of the vote, major publishers\u2014including McGraw-Hill and Pearson\u2014stripped out passages that cast doubt on climate change. The revisions followed fierce criticism of the content from groups like the Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning advocacy group that pushes for man-made global warming to be taught in the books, and Climate Parents, an organization dedicated to teaching climate science. Eighty-nine new social-studies textbooks have now been approved in the state. But school districts have a lot of leeway over exactly which books to buy, a series of decisions that they're slated to make this spring. The coalition sees that policy as an opportunity. It plans to send out a report to school districts detailing the grades assigned to each book. Volunteers are also gearing up to distribute their ratings among concerned-citizens groups and parent-teacher organizations. \"We have created a tool so that now people will have a sense of which books are best for their kids,\" White says. Still, options for altering climate curriculum are limited. None of the approved textbooks that will be used in classrooms next fall dispute the scientific consensus that man-made climate change is underway. The coalition is working to encourage publishers to make last-minute changes before the books go to print this fall. Barring that, volunteers hope public pressure will inspire teachers to teach climate controversy even if textbooks do not mandate that approach. \"Children are so vulnerable in their younger years and what they hear they believe is truth,\" said Karin Gililland, another volunteer with the coalition. \"Truth is what this is all about. We want truth.\" Emily McBurney echoed that concern: \"I'm afraid that [teaching climate change] is instilling fear in children at a very young age that either we're going to run out of something or overpollute the Earth. I didn't want them to come away with the wrong impression of America.\" But opponents of the coalition insist that teaching the controversy and not the consensus on climate change will lead to devastating consequences. \"Whether climate change is real and caused by humans is not scientifically disputed, and textbooks or teachers who pretend that it is would be miseducating students,\" said Josh Rosenau, the programs and policy director for the National Center for Science Education. Dan Quinn, a spokesman for the Texas Freedom Network, doubts the coalition will gain traction. He called their reviews \"amateurish\" and \"overtly political\" and believes \"school administrators and teachers who make the purchasing decisions will see right through the nonsense.\" Volunteers with the coalition remain optimistic and determined to achieve their aim. \"This is just the beginning,\" McBurney said. \"We're hoping to spread the word throughout the United States, throughout the world.\"","headline":"The Plan to Get Climate-Change Denial Into Schools","article_name":383540.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/education\/archive\/2014\/12\/the-plan-to-get-climate-change-denial-into-schools\/383540\/","date_published":"2014-12-08 19:30:00","article_length":6650,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:32.339756","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/education\/archive\/2014\/12\/the-plan-to-get-climate-change-denial-into-schools\/383540\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Temperatures are rising, and they\u2019re taking pollen counts with them. This article was originally published by The Conversation . Brace yourselves, allergy sufferers: New research shows that pollen season is going to get a lot longer and more intense with climate change. Our latest study finds that the U.S. will face up to a 200 percent increase in total pollen this century if the world continues producing carbon-dioxide emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources at a high rate. Under that scenario, the spring pollen season will generally start up to 40 days earlier and last up to 19 days longer than it does today. As atmospheric  scientists , we study how the atmosphere and climate affect trees and plants. Although most studies focus on pollen overall, we zoomed in on more than a dozen types of grasses and trees and how their pollen will affect regions across the U.S. in different ways. For example, because of species such as oak and cypress, the Northeast will see the biggest pollen increase, but allergens will be on the rise just about everywhere, with consequences for human health and the economy. If your head is pounding at just the thought of this, we also have some good news, at least in terms of knowing in advance when pollen waves are coming. We\u2019re working on using the model from this study to develop more accurate local pollen forecasts. Let\u2019s start with the basics. Pollen\u2014the dustlike grains produced by grasses and plants\u2014contains the male genetic material for a plant\u2019s reproduction. How much pollen is produced depends on how the plant grows. Rising global temperatures will boost plant growth in many areas, and that, in turn, will affect pollen production. But temperature is only part of the equation. We found that the bigger driver of the pollen increase will be rising carbon-dioxide emissions. The higher temperature will extend the growing season, giving plants more time to emit pollen and reproduce. Carbon dioxide, meanwhile, fuels photosynthesis, so plants may grow larger and produce more pollen. We found that carbon-dioxide levels may have a much greater impact than temperature on future pollen increases. Rather than treating all pollen the same, as many past studies have, we looked at 15 different pollen types. Typically, pollination starts with leafy deciduous trees in late winter and spring. Alder, birch, and oak are the three top allergy-causing deciduous trees, though there are others, such as mulberry. Then grasses come out in the summer, followed by ragweed in late summer. In the Southeast, evergreen trees such as mountain cedar and juniper (in the cypress family) start pollinating in January. In Texas, \u201ccedar fever\u201d is the equivalent of hay fever. We found that in the Northeast, the pollen seasons for a lot of allergenic trees will overlap more and more as temperatures and carbon-dioxide emissions rise. For example, oak trees used to release pollen first, and then birch would pollinate. Now their pollen seasons blur together. In general, pollen season will change more in northern states than in the southern ones, because of larger temperature increases in northern areas. Southeastern regions, including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, can expect greater grass- and weed-pollen increases in the future. The Pacific Northwest is likely to see peak pollen season a month earlier because of alder\u2019s early pollen season. Most pollen forecasts right now provide only a very broad estimate. Part of the problem is that there aren\u2019t many observing stations for pollen counts: Fewer than 100 of these stations are distributed across the country. Michigan, where we live, doesn\u2019t have any. Measuring different types of pollen is a very labor-intensive process. As a result, current forecasts have a lot of uncertainties. They are likely based in large part on what a station has observed in the past and the weather forecast. Our model, if integrated into a forecasting framework, could provide more targeted pollen forecasts across the country. We can estimate where trees are from satellite data and on-the-ground surveys. We also know how temperature influences when pollen is released\u2014 what we call its phenology. With that information, we can use meteorological factors such as wind, relative humidity, and precipitation to figure out how much pollen gets into the air, and atmospheric models can show how it is blown around, to create a real-time forecast. All of that information allows us to look at where pollen might be in space and time so that people dealing with allergies will know what\u2019s coming in their area. We\u2019re currently talking with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lab about ways to integrate this information into a tool for air-quality forecasting. Some unknowns still exist when it comes to long-term pollen projections. For example, scientists don\u2019t fully understand why plants produce more pollen in some years than others. There\u2019s not a good way to include that variability in models. Also unclear is how plants will respond if carbon-dioxide levels go through the roof. Further, ragweed and residential trees are hard to capture. There are very few ragweed surveys showing where these plants are growing in the U.S., but that can be improved. A 2021 study found that the overall pollen season was already about 20 days longer in North America than it had been in 1990 and that pollen concentrations were up about 21 percent. Increased pollen levels will have a much broader impact than a few sniffles and headaches. Seasonal allergies affect about 30 percent of the U.S. population , and they have economic impacts, including health-care costs and missed working days . In the coming years, those impacts will only intensify.","headline":"Climate Change Is Making Allergy Season Even Worse","article_name":627103.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/climate-change-allergies-pollen\/627103\/","date_published":"2022-03-20 12:00:00","article_length":5761,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:32.988862","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/climate-change-allergies-pollen\/627103\/","source":"atlantic"}

Every Tuesday morning, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . The election of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States is not only the biggest climate news in half a decade\u2014it\u2019s some of the best. I mean that not as a statement of political opinion but of obvious fact. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies accelerated global warming; his officials boxed out climate experts at nearly every opportunity; and he personally seemed to revel in making climate change worse. He still seems to savor it: Yesterday, Trump fired the head of the federal climate-science research program. Biden, meanwhile, has identified climate change as one of the four great crises America faces. And he has said that decarbonization\u2014the elimination of carbon pollution from the economy\u2014must be central to how the country recovers from the coronavirus recession. Beyond that, though, we don\u2019t know much yet about Biden\u2019s priorities. We don\u2019t know whom he will appoint or what goals he will prioritize in office. We\u2019re somewhere between the poetry of campaigning and the prose of governance\u2014in other words, we\u2019re in a listicle. So in that spirit, here are five ways I am thinking about climate change in a Biden presidency: 1. There is plenty that Biden can do. So  much , in fact, that I\u2019m hesitant to list any of it here. He\u2019s already committed to rejoining the Paris Agreement on his first day, a symbolic move but an important one globally. But what\u2019s more consequential is that Biden will take the reins of an administrative state whose lead policy makers are desperate to do something about climate change. In the past year, a handful of economic regulators\u2014such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates complex financial products\u2014 have proposed policies that would fight global warming and hasten the energy transition. Of course, Trump didn\u2019t touch them. But Biden could. 2. Which is all to say: The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy are not the sole agencies that matter. The staff at the Department of Commerce, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and a Chef Boyardee\u2019s worth of financial regulators have flirted with climate policy under Trump. Under a Biden administration, those agencies will be unleashed. 3. Look to see who works in Biden\u2019s White House. There\u2019s already a lot of focus on whom Biden will pick to lead some of the energy and environment agencies. (Mary Nichols, the chief air-pollution regulator in California, is reportedly a leading candidate to run the EPA.) But it matters less whom Biden picks to advise the agencies than whom Biden seeks out for advice. In the Obama administration, the obstacles to climate action did not arise, in large part, from appointed energy or environmental officials. They came instead from Barack Obama\u2019s political advisers, economic experts, and internal White House office directors. Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, was so skeptical of climate change as a winning issue that he once chastised Obama\u2019s energy secretary for discussing rising sea levels with the press. Emanuel also cut big-ticket green items from the 2009 stimulus bill because he was skeptical they could be sold to the public. And it was the economist Larry Summers who, as head of Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, shot down a national power grid and opposed spending more than a tenth of the 2009 stimulus on renewable energy. 4. So much depends on the Senate. Right now, Democrats hold only 48 seats in the Senate. Their only apparent chance to take over the upper chamber before 2022 will come on January 5, when Georgia will hold runoff elections for its two Senate seats. If Democrats take the Senate that day, then Biden will have the best chance to fight climate change of any American leader in a decade . Many of his climate proposals, such as his $2 trillion recovery package, will be politically feasible only with a Democratic Senate. Controlling the Senate is also his only path to appointing Supreme Court justices. But if Democrats fail to win the Georgia runoffs, then the question becomes how much, exactly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will allow Biden to accomplish. McConnell blocked many of President Obama\u2019s appointees, but we can only speculate as to how he will treat Biden. Maybe he will horse-trade with Biden on the budget, exchanging infrastructure investment for tax cuts. Or\u2014more likely\u2014he could decline to confirm Biden\u2019s Cabinet secretaries. Or he could suddenly demand budget cuts, despite swelling the federal deficit for the past few years. (As I and others have written , there is little financial or political reason to worry about the deficit right now\u2014if anything, the American economy would benefit from higher deficits.) 5. The energy transition will be won or lost. In any case, the question is how much Senate Republicans will respond to the economic threat posed by a global energy transition. Here\u2019s a parable. Modern solar panels were invented in the United States in the 1950s. For decades, American companies owned 95 percent of the global solar market. But then they lost their advantage in the 1980s\u2014and, today, Chinese firms dominate the fast-growing market, while U.S. firms control a fraction of their market share . That same story could now play out in the global auto market. The Chinese government has invested billions in electric-vehicle development, and most of the world\u2019s most successful EV makers are Chinese. (The sole American exception is, of course, Tesla.) China hopes to leverage its dominance in electric cars to take a greater share of the global auto market, much as the United States did in the mid-20th century with internal-combustion engines. If American automakers want to catch up, they will require federal assistance and industrial policy\u2014federal planning and investment designed to boost whole industries over the long term. So too will American companies in other transitioning industries, such as carbon-neutral steel, wind-turbine manufacturing, and hydrogen. This kind of government leadership isn\u2019t historically unusual \u2014arguably, industrial policy is what helped develop America\u2014but it is certainly out of vogue. Are Republicans willing to indulge in it? Will politicians learn the industrial lessons of the coronavirus pandemic\u2014when America so lacked manufacturing capacity that it could not secure the number of face masks, protective gear, and tests it needed? And if so, what kind of EV-focused stimulus is possible\u2014and how much would McConnell agree to? The answer could determine whether the U.S. plans for the future or meanders into it. Tropical Storm Eta made landfall on Sunday in Cuba before hitting the Florida Keys. Eta is the 28th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season; last night, Subtropical Storm Theta formed in the Atlantic , meaning that the 2020 season has now broken 2005\u2019s record for the most named storms in the Atlantic basin. Every week, I hope to feature a weather photo from a reader or professional in this part of the newsletter, because the climate is someone else\u2019s weather . If you would like to submit one, please email weeklyplanet@theatlantic.com. In last week\u2019s edition , I wrote about three down-ballot races that could shape American climate policy. Now that the votes are in, I don\u2019t have much good news to report: In Texas , the Democrat Chrysta Casta\u00f1eda lost her race to become one of three oil-and-gas commissioners. Republicans will extend their 25-year streak of unified control over that agency. In Arizona , Democrats also failed to win a majority on the five-seat Corporate Commission , which oversees utilities, pipelines, and business law in the state. One of the winning Republican candidates, Jim O\u2019Connor, has cast doubt on the existence of climate change and questioned the value of clean-electricity mandates. He and the other two GOP commissioners may now repeal clean-electricity mandates passed last month. Finally, in Minnesota , the statehouse will remain divided : Republicans have maintained their edge in the state Senate\u2014though a few races may go to a recount. We\u2019re unlikely to see significant statewide climate legislation out of Minneapolis for the next two years. 1. Be wary of anyone offering lessons about the election: We simply don\u2019t have enough information about it yet. Many states are still counting mail-in ballots, and we won\u2019t understand how each demographic voted until the weighted exit polls come out in a few months. But we can look at geographical trends\u2014and one of the biggest so far is that Biden underperformed in heavily Latino areas of southern Texas. The whole Rio Grande Valley, in fact, normally a Democratic stronghold, seems to have swung to the right over the past few years: Was it partly because of the sheer number of oil-industry jobs in the region? 2. Historically, renewable-energy companies have been so cash-strapped that they haven\u2019t gotten involved in political fundraising. But that changed this year , Emily Atkin reports in her newsletter, Heated . She finds that climate- and renewable-focused fundraisers raised at least $20.2 million for the Biden campaign. 3. And this is what climate change looks like: More and more of California is burning every year, and it\u2019s becoming a problem for home insurers . The state has again blocked home insurers from dropping policies that are more risky because of climate change. But this will not disarm the unfired gun (one of many to worry about) on the Golden State\u2019s mantel: Because mortgages last for 30 years but require home insurance, but home-insurance policies must be renewed every year , the state is staring down a future where up to a fifth of its real-estate stock becomes potentially unsalable. But here\u2019s some reasonably good news: California\u2019s dry season ended this week , with much of the state seeing rain, snow, or hail. The arrival of wet weather ends the worst fire season, as measured by acres burned, in the state\u2019s modern history . Thanks for reading. Did someone forward you this newsletter?

{"id":null,"body":"I\u2019ve never thought we should stop having children. But I will have to teach our son to wonder at the world before he learns to fear for it. Our first child was born at the end of August. I am not a young parent; I was born in 1974, and in the span of this one generation, global carbon levels rose by nearly twice as much as in all of human history before. I teach environmental law, so naturally people get around to asking whether my wife and I struggled with what it means to bring a child onto this troubled planet, and whether it is a good thing to do at all. I take the point. James added his seven pounds, 10 ounces to a planet where humans and our domestic animals together outweigh the other land-based vertebrates by 24 to 1. As an American, he can expect to emit 16 metric tons of carbon a year, compared with five for a French newborn and about two for a baby in India or Indonesia. Unless he\u2019s a saintly hermit, he\u2019ll have little personal choice about that carbon load. Most of it is dictated by the roads, engines, and sources of energy that will keep him cool or warm, provide his food, and move him around. He can\u2019t opt out of these systems without opting out of human life as we live it now. Sometime not too long after he starts asking about the change from winter to spring, or the migration patterns of the geese that sometimes pass high overhead, I will need a way to explain that climate change is destroying habitats, acidifying the oceans, and making large parts of the planet\u2019s land uninhabitable for people. To quote the cards from friends and family that we\u2019ve lovingly placed around our apartment: Welcome, baby. On one level, my answer to \u201cHow can you have a child now?\u201d is simple. I have never been tempted to think we should all stop having children and disappear. Part of the reason climate change is so terrible is the threat it poses to human life and culture, and I want to help them go on. So the question I ask myself every day is how to explain this suffering world to a newcomer. This is what I find myself saying, to this little person who can\u2019t understand me quite yet: \u201cThe world is good, for all the bad in it\u2014a good place. And you are good: full of joy, born innocent. But you are not good for the world. When you do all the things you will do\u2014work, play, love\u2014you will be breaking down its systems, making it unlivable. And there is very little that you, personally, can do about it.\u201d What kind of welcome is that? It is a truthful one, at least, but it raises more questions. What does it mean to teach a child to live in a time of perennial crisis, always in the shadow of loss? I think about trying to teach him love and wonder first, before he inevitably learns fear. I would like him to be fascinated by a Manhattan red oak, a red-tailed hawk perched in its limbs, or a morel mushroom at its roots, before he thinks, This forest is going to die, with everything in it. When the thought of climate doom arrives, I hope it will arrive in a mind already prepared by curiosity and pleasure to know why this world is worth fighting to preserve. Read: How I talk to my daughter about climate change And I hope it will soften the edge of doom for him to know that the world we love has been desolated and climate-changed for a very long time. I imagine we\u2019ll conjure together the ghosts of the wolves and elk that once lived in Manhattan, and the long-lost bison in the West Virginia hills where his grandparents live. A little later, he will know that 10,000 years ago there were giant ground sloths, dire wolves, mastodons, and more. He will learn that before 125th Street was a commercial hub of southern Harlem, it was a streambed running out of the stony flanks of Morningside Heights and curving down to what is still a wetland at the northeastern corner of Central Park. Some of the wonder of the world is what is already gone from it. Nothing he learns to love will be undamaged. Love for half-broken things and places is what he will have to practice, like all of us. A love for imperfect and impermanent things isn\u2019t a bad starting point for passionate democratic politics. We\u2019ll be sure to tell him that being personally powerless to change the world doesn\u2019t mean being collectively powerless, that we can still make a politics big and generous enough to change course. James was less than a month old when tens of thousands of people rallied in New York City for the global climate strike. We walked him down Riverside Drive and quietly joined in with the chants of elementary-school children marching for the planet. \u201cLook, James,\u201d I whispered, \u201cbig kids!\u201d I hope he and his classmates will assume that the Green New Deal is only the beginning of what we need to make peace with the planet, and with one another. Much of our unease about having children today is rooted in fear of what they will do to the planet. We fear, too, what this changing world will do to them . Children in some places, unprotected by wealth or geography, will be predictably less safe than others, but no one will be beyond danger. Like any parent, I feel this like a cold hand on my heart. But most human lives have begun under threat, from war, exploitation, disease, starvation, or storm and drought. Our moment is radically exceptional in that a few hundred million people have been able to imagine real safety as the normal background of human life. That is a precious thing, but to preserve and extend it, we have to be willing to go on without its assurance. The only alternative to giving up on humanity is to have children whom we cannot keep as safe as we would wish, or as safe as some of us were raised to imagine we could. And if we are ultimately going to build a world that is both safer and fairer, we will have to start by working to save as well as transform the same civilizations that have ruinously misused the Earth. For now, as the poet Wallace Stevens wrote in a 1942 poem eerily titled \u201cThe Poems of Our Climate,\u201d the imperfect is our paradise. This ever more broken world is the only route to a better one. Read: The East Coast is going to get Arkansas-ified New York City is a good place for a post-natural naturalist\u2019s education in uncertainty. It has been climate-changed forever. We can study seasons by looking upriver at the forest-topped cliffs of the Palisades near the George Washington Bridge, already bare in late fall while the trees of Manhattan\u2019s heat island stay halfway green. He will learn that in the city, raccoons are not nocturnal as they are elsewhere, not afraid of dogs or people\u2014that, like other migrants to New York, they have adapted to its rhythms. He will learn that in this beautiful place, nothing is permanent or entirely secure. After James had his vaccinations, his 7-year-old cousin, William, came into the city to meet the baby. While James slept, William and I walked into Riverside Park, to what I think is one of the last free-flowing springs in Manhattan, which pops out of a hillside and flows less than 100 feet to a drain running to the Hudson. I helped him gather stones, branches, and leaves to dam the little stream. We watched our pool build up, then broke the dam for the brief pleasure of watching newly freed water leap downhill, for just a moment, as wild as anything in the world.","headline":"The Concession to Climate Change I Will Not Make","article_name":604372.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/becoming-parent-age-climate-crisis\/604372\/","date_published":"2020-01-06 17:06:10","article_length":7291,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:34.017369","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/becoming-parent-age-climate-crisis\/604372\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Both\u00a0 The New York Times \u00a0and\u00a0 Politico \u00a0published stories this week based off a climate change\u00a0 report ,\u00a0but somehow came to very different conclusions about what the report means. Both The New York Times and Politico published stories this week based off a climate change report from the National\u00a0Academy of Sciences\u00a0titled \"Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change:\u00a0Anticipating Surprises,\" but somehow came to very different conclusions about what the report means. Politico opens by warning readers that, according to the report's findings, global warming is happening, and we'll start to really, really notice it soon: Climate change isn\u2019t just a problem facing future generations, a new scientific report warns, saying the planet could suffer serious and abrupt climate threats in the next few years or decades \u2014 leaving nations with a narrow window to adapt. Times\u00a0 contributor Andrew C. Revkin concluded, on the other hand, that climate change effects are not imminent: The findings... reinforce the reality that the biggest impacts of greenhouse-driven global warming still lie several generations in the future. Huh. The devil, as always, is in the details. The report authors write in the study's abstract that our climate is changing now much faster than it has over millions of years of the earth's development \u2014 which isn't really news. They go on to advise world leaders to take action to prevent future, deadly damage to the environment which is, again, standard scientific consensus. Politico appears to be responding to an accelerated time frame mentioned by the authors: The primary timescale of concern is years to decades.\u00a0A key characteristic of these changes is that they can come faster than expected, planned, or budgeted for, forcing more reactive, rather than proactive, modes of behavior. What Politico presumed, apparently, was that the \"years to decades\" in question are expected to occur within our lifetimes. However, Revkin asked report author Richard Alley (who also worked on a 2002 installment of the report called \" Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises ,\") to elaborate on this year's findings, and he explained that drastic change is unlikely before the year 2100 : Enough of the hard work of measuring and modeling has been done to provide high scientific confidence that while we are and will affect the north Atlantic with climate change, and this will have consequences, it is very unlikely that there will be a huge and abrupt change in the coming decades. Revkin writes that according to the report, there is a moderate risk of certain abrupt shifts \u2014 like more intense heat waves and other natural disasters; lower levels of ocean oxygen; and changes in species and ecosystems \u2014 occurring in this century. Changes like rising sea levels and climate variability alterations are improbable before, but more likely after, 2100. Of course, a less severe abruption could still pose a huge threat to human life, and perhaps Politico is focusing on practical ramifications of less-severe effects. Alley says , \"Katrina\u2019s high waters just made it over the levee, and the difference between 'just over' and 'not quite over' proved to be a lot of billions of dollars and human disruption.\" So the distinction between less- and more-severe is not actually all that comforting. Both articles stress that the report outlined a number of measures that governments must take to rein in the effects of climate change... something that the\u00a0 20-30 whales currently trapped in the Everglades \u00a0probably agree is definitely a real thing.","headline":"How to Draw Two Opposite Conclusions From the Same Climate Change Report ","article_name":355786.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/12\/climate-change-report\/355786\/","date_published":"2013-12-04 18:47:27","article_length":3561,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:34.900527","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/12\/climate-change-report\/355786\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"U.S. carbon pollution hasn\u2019t been this low in decades\u2014that\u2019s the bad news. Every Tuesday, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox . Hello! Many things have happened since we last spoke. The most significant of them, for our purposes, was probably that Democrats won the Georgia runoffs, giving the party a Senate majority. Democrats have achieved a governing trifecta\u2014winning control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency\u2014only twice since the advent of modern American climate politics in 1988 \u00b9 ; each time, they have tried and failed to pass legislation to reduce carbon pollution. This is their third opportunity. But I say probably because this development was not, somehow, last week\u2019s biggest news. On Wednesday, a partially armed mob incited by President Donald Trump attacked Congress with the goal of overturning the presidential election. The insurrectionists killed a Capitol Police officer and injured more than 50 other officers. They erected a gallows near the Capitol building and chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d It was a humiliating day to be an American, and everything we know suggests that it was supposed to be worse . A rupture in the constitutional system might seem outside the scope of this newsletter, but in fact this riot involved\u2014in extremely pedestrian ways\u2014some of the same industries that we talk about here. The march that led to last week\u2019s riot was partially organized and promoted by a group called the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The fund was listed on the march\u2019s website; in a robocall, a spokesperson for the fund invited Americans to \u201cmarch to the Capitol building\u201d and \u201cstop the steal.\u201d While the Rule of Law Defense Fund does not have to disclose its supporters, it has a long and cozy connection with the energy industry. And we do know who some of its donors are. From 2014 to 2016, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned electric utilities, gave $50,000 to the fund. More recently, a nonprofit wholly funded by American Electric Power gave the fund $150,000. Most Americans get their electricity from a power company that belongs to EEI or from American Electric Power itself, which is one of the country\u2019s largest utilities . As I said: These connections are extremely pedestrian. But they capture the tedious way that clout is exercised by the utility industry\u2014the way that pennies skimmed off electric bills become a financial force. In the U.S., we have no control over our local utility: If you want electricity, you have to pay your power bill. So if your utility indirectly contributes to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, you have no choice\u2014you do too. In a statement, EEI told me that it strongly condemned last week\u2019s insurrection, which it called \u201ca violent and deadly attempt to damage our democracy.\u201d American Electric Power also condemned the \u201cviolence that happened at the U.S. Capitol\u201d and called for unity. A spokesperson said that the utility never made \u201cdirect contributions\u201d to the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The nonprofit that did make those donations is a \u201cseparate organization,\u201d she said. Both EEI and American Electric Power said they would pause all political contributions for the time being. Utilities\u2019 support of the Rule of Law Defense Fund isn\u2019t surprising: Giving to the group presumably served their interests. The fund is an offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General Association, and it was run by Scott Pruitt until 2016, when Trump nominated him to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. You may remember his aggressively anti-climate agenda at the EPA, but Pruitt was an anti-environmental warrior during his time as Oklahoma attorney general too. Utilities did not want to be restricted by EPA regulations such as the Obama administration\u2019s rule limiting mercury emissions from coal plants , even though mercury is a neurotoxin that stunts brain development in children. Pruitt and his fellow AGs were willing to help them fight such rules. Surely some partisan jockeying over environmental regulations is understandable, even normal. But over time the sense of what was normal shifted, and last week the Rule of Law Defense Fund helped organize an attack on the rule of law. I don\u2019t think utility lobbyists ever thought that they would need to distance themselves from an insurrection. But that\u2019s the point. The Republican Party is a powerful governing institution. It shapes policy and politics in every city and state; companies can\u2019t help but interact with it. You might even say the GOP forms a pillar of the unwritten U.S. Constitution, the set of norms and rules that assume two large parties will vie for power while respecting the sanctity of the law. Trying to overturn a presidential election runs afoul of this rulebook, as does fomenting a mob attack on Congress. So while Congress and our constitutional order may have survived last week\u2019s attack, the fact that a group of Republican attorneys general were implicated in the insurrection shows how deeply this unwritten Constitution has failed, and the Republican Party with it. This would be a hard problem to contend with by itself. Unfortunately we also have to deal with climate change at the same time. So, 2020 was kind of a weird year\u2014for you and also, as it happens, for the U.S. energy system. Today, the Rhodium Group, an energy-analysis firm, released its estimate of U.S. greenhouse-gas pollution in 2020 . Experts expected that emissions would decline\u2014the pandemic brought the world to a standstill for weeks and then months\u2014but it wasn\u2019t clear just how much they would fall. Turns out: pretty far. In 2020, American greenhouse-gas pollution fell 10.3 percent, a staggering decline and the largest year-over-year drop since World War II. But the nature of this drop was not cheering. In climate policy, carbon emissions can drop for \u201cthe good reason\u201d\u2014the energy system has decarbonized, allowing us to grow the economy without increasing carbon pollution\u2014or for \u201cthe bad reason\u201d\u2014the economy has itself collapsed. In 2020, emissions fell almost entirely for the bad reason. \u201cEconomic pain is not the right way to reduce emissions going forward,\u201d Kate Larsen , who leads climate research at the Rhodium Group, told me. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d There are two benchmarks in American emissions accounting: 2005, when U.S. carbon pollution peaked, and 1990, when the United Nations published its first climate report. Last year, U.S. emissions fell to about 21 percent below their 2005 level and \u2014for the first time this century\u2014below their 1990 level. (That means emissions were lower last year than they have ever been in my lifetime.) This is a larger annual drop than anyone expected to see not only in 2020, but in any year in the  2020s . \u201cI don\u2019t think any of our current policy projections had us reaching 1990 levels before 2030 or at any point in the future, really,\u201d Larsen said. At about this point last year, Rhodium projected that\u2014barring the passage of major new climate laws\u2014emissions would \u201cdecline over the next couple of years and then flatline above 1990 levels indefinitely,\u201d she said. Instead, the pandemic happened, and emissions fell below 1990 levels in a matter of months. But that tumble downhill only showed how much further we still have to hike: For all the economic upheaval, the U.S. did not reach the goal that, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, it\u2019s meant to hit just four years from now, in 2025. The math only gets harder for more ambitious targets. President-elect Joe Biden has said that the U.S. should aim to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050. That scale of reduction obviously couldn\u2019t happen in a single year, so analysts have tried to estimate a glide path for getting there. Larsen\u2019s rule of thumb is that by 2030, the U.S. would need to cut emissions to about 40 percent below their historic peak to stay on track. But last year, amid the pandemic, the U.S. managed a cut of only 21 percent. So the U.S. would need to double 2020\u2019s cuts in less than a decade if we hope to stay on track for net zero. In other words: \u201cWe will need emissions reductions of this scale \u2026 for many years to come, and we need to do it differently than we did in 2020,\u201d Larsen said. Across the economy, the sheer strangeness of the pandemic economy held other climate lessons. Here are three takeaways from 2020 emissions that might help you think about climate change: Generally, emissions declined last year because the economy crumbled. The one exception to that trend is the power sector. Electricity demand declined by only about 2 percent: We used the same amount of electricity as we would in a normal year; we just used it all at home. Yet greenhouse-gas pollution from the power sector fell by 10.3 percent. Coal\u2019s ongoing decline explains this shift. In 2019, the American coal industry entered a free fall , with coal use dropping 18 percent. Last year, the plunge continued, and coal use fell by almost 19 percent. Renewables and gas made up the difference. In the past decade, most of the power sector\u2019s emissions declines have come from the coal-to-gas switch. This can make climate advocates nervous, because the climate cannot sustain an indefinite build-out of natural-gas infrastructure. Gas is, after all, still a fossil fuel, and even though it is a cleaner fuel source than coal, its production releases the hyper-heat-trapping pollutant methane. The rest of the 2020 energy system looked more like the transportation sector, which bore the brunt of the pandemic. Transportation emissions fell nearly 15 percent as gasoline and jet-fuel consumption plummeted. Diesel, however, didn\u2019t fall nearly as far, and by December it had returned to its 2019 level. Larsen sees a lesson in this divergence: Diesel tends to be used to transport goods, so it\u2019s a proxy for economic consumption more widely. But jet fuel and gasoline are used for personal travel. \u201cRather than the economy shutting down, we still made things and we still moved things around,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was really about making people stay in one place.\u201d Many of 2020\u2019s emissions drops were due to the springtime shutdowns\u2014in most cases, and to Larsen\u2019s surprise, transportation activity had rebounded by the end of the year. Vehicle miles traveled, a metric that tracks how much Americans are driving their personal cars and trucks, reached its low point in April and May, then bounded partway back: In May, too, jet-fuel demand dropped by 68 percent compared with the year before. But by December it had made up nearly half of that gap. In 2015 and every year prior, the electricity sector emitted more carbon pollution than any other part of the economy. Since 2016, it has been in second place, and the transportation sector has held the No. 1 spot. But starting next year, Rhodium projects, it will fall to third place . Both transportation and the industrial sector will generate more carbon pollution than the electricity sector. This represents a massive change in how the U.S. energy system works, and it has taken place in half a decade. It also means that people concerned about the climate should probably get more familiar with how the industrial sector works . It is the next great problem to solve. About a quarter of industrial emissions come from plastic and petrochemical production, Laren said, while oil and gas drilling account for about a fifth of emissions. Refining, cement production, iron- and steelmaking, and mining also contribute. Above all else, we should focus on a broad lesson about 2020. In the spring, Americans conducted an unprecedented and unintentional experiment in reducing carbon emissions . They did not drive to work or travel for fun; they stayed at home. The world grew quieter, the air cleaner. Wildlife moved back into urban spaces. And carbon emissions decreased. In April and May, emissions were 20 percent lower than they had been a year prior. But that behavioral change was not enough to meet even the least ambitious of America\u2019s long-term climate goals . This extraordinary and painful trial should provide the final proof, I think, that climate change simply cannot be solved by changing our personal behavior. We have to change systems, and the only way to do that is to develop and deploy technologies that will enable economic prosperity without carbon pollution. Rachel Ertz shares these incredible photos of Sheridan Lake in Cordova, Alaska, a town of about 2,100 in the south-central region of the state. \u201cRecent heavy rainfall followed up by a drop in temperature lent the lake ice a clean, zambonied appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf of the community came out to skate and enjoy a rare moment of apricity in the fleeting winter sun!\u201d Apricity \u2014I had to look it up\u2014means \u201cthe warmth of the sun in winter.\u201d Arctic photography and a new word: We are so lucky.

{"id":null,"body":"How Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and Co. could help fight global warming. A high-ranking State Department official wants to enlist Princess Elsa and a talking snowman to teach the American public about the Arctic. Adm. Robert Papp, the U.S. special representative for the Arctic, told an audience at the Arctic Frontiers conference in Norway this week that he met with a Disney executive to discuss raising awareness about the polar region using characters from the wildly popular movie Frozen . You can't be in this business and not see Frozen, Papp said, adding that he has watched the movie at least 20 times thanks to his two young granddaughters. A staffer from his office came up with the idea for Disney to create public service announcements focused on the Arctic starring the movie's main characters: Elsa, a princess with powers over ice and snow; her younger sister, Anna; a reindeer named Sven; and Olaf, a talking snowman who loves summer. \"I said, you've taught an entire generation about the Arctic,\" Papp said, describing his exchange with the Disney executive. \"Unfortunately, the Arctic that you've taught them about is a fantasy kingdom in Norway where everything is nice. What we really need to do is educate the American youth about the plight of the polar bear, about the thawing tundra, about Alaskan villages that run the risk of falling into the sea because of the lack of sea ice protecting their shores.\" But Papp said the pitch didn't go over so well because Disney prefers happier tales. \"As I continued to talk, I could see the executive getting more and more perplexed, and he said: 'Admiral, you might not understand: Here at Disney it's in our culture to tell stories that project optimism and have happy endings.' \" Papp was appointed envoy to the Arctic last summer. The admiral has said that addressing climate change will be a top priority for the U.S. when it takes the helm of the Arctic Council, an international forum, this spring. Scientists warn that the Arctic is warming at a rate that is twice as fast as the rest of the world and is highly susceptible to the effects of climate change. The State Department reached out to Disney about raising Arctic awareness, but it was informational only and no collaboration is planned at this time, a spokesperson for the department said. Disney did not immediately return a request for comment. As for Papp, he won't Let It Go. \"There's more yet to come there,\" he promised.","headline":"State Department Official Wants Disney's 'Frozen' to Teach Kids About Climate Change","article_name":445104.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/01\/state-department-official-wants-disneys-frozen-to-teach-kids-about-climate-change\/445104\/","date_published":"2015-01-23 11:50:00","article_length":2449,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:36.100320","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/01\/state-department-official-wants-disneys-frozen-to-teach-kids-about-climate-change\/445104\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"This morning, Lisa Jackson was sworn in as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Not three hours later, President Obama ordered her to reconsider a waiver requested by California to require that automakers meet tight emissions standards by 2011.\u00a0 Later in the day, Todd Stern was sworn in as the administration's envoy on climate change. And administration officials promised swift action on Obama's Green Energy and climate change agenda, no small task because Congress is quite busy. To get perspective on what Obama did today, and what he might do in the future, and what Congress will say, I spoke with Daniel J. Weiss, the director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress. Weiss consults regularly with Obama advisers.\u00a0 Here's an edited transcript. Me: How significant, in the realm of actions that the President can take, were today's actions? Weiss: Today's action was very significant. It continues the emphasis that President Obama has put on clean energy and reduce oil dependence since he took office on Jan. 20. The stimulus package has close to 90 billion dollars in spending on clean energy over the next two years.\u00a0 Today's action will increase fuel economy and lead automakers to build the gas-sipping cars of the future. President Obama has done more in one week to foster clean energy and energy independence than George Bush did in 8 years. Is the Obama administration certain that the auto industry , given all of their other troubles, can make the deadline? The auto industry has never seen a deadline that they couldn't meet. ... Once standards are set, they turn it over to their engineers, and find a way to do it faster and cheaper than what their lobbyists said.\u00a0 The auto companies do not like the California waivers. But, their plans indicate they will probably come close to meeting the standards based on what they'll do in their reconstruction plan. ...\u00a0 One question for Obama and the Congress is, are they going to allow the bridge loans that [the automakers] reiceved or the future bridge loans that they're going to seek -- are they going to be allowed to use any of that money to challenge the waivers in court? That was part of the round of debate... Pelosi had it in her bill.. And it was dropped from the Senate. Right. I think it's going to come back because the next round is not legislative. How does today's actions effect the other states seeking waivers? It is important to note that other states have to adopt the California program in toto, so that you will have two standards: one for California and these 18 other states, and one for everywhere else. What that means is that half the market will have these cars with these standards and hopefully, the auto companies will just make all the cars that clean. This has the potential to drive much less global-warming-polluting cars much more quickly than would otherwise occur. What other steps can the president take unilaterally?\u00a0 You've talked about an \"endangerment finding,\" which is something that a lot of climate scientists have been pushing for.... We hope that EPA administration Jackson will re-examine the endangerment finding that [ex-EPA administrator] Steven Johnson failed to make and will make it promptly rather than slowly. Realistically, given the challenging economy and Congress being extremely busy, do you think it is likely that there will be significant progress made towards writing legislation for a cap and trade system this year? Yes. Chairman Waxman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee says he intends to have a bill out of committee by Memorial Day.\u00a0 Whether or not that deadline is met, that's the target.\u00a0 .... When Speaker Pelosi did the same thing in '07, it was done by the fourth of July.\u00a0 So, that means they're going to be going on a fast track.","headline":"Interview: Daniel Weiss On Climate Change And What Happens Next ","article_name":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2009\/01\/interview-daniel-weiss-on-climate-change-and-what-happens-next\/137\/","date_published":"2009-01-26 20:30:16","article_length":3820,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:37.065288","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2009\/01\/interview-daniel-weiss-on-climate-change-and-what-happens-next\/137\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate change is altering wine as we know it. This article was originally published by Knowable Magazine . Soon after the devastating Glass Fire sparked in California\u2019s Napa Valley in September 2020, wine chemist Anita Oberholster\u2019s inbox was brimming with hundreds of emails from panicked viticulturists. They wanted to know if they could harvest their grapes without a dreaded effect on their wine: the odious ashtray flavor known as smoke taint. Oberholster, of UC Davis, could only tell them, \u201cMaybe.\u201d Industry laboratories were slammed with grape samples to test, with wait times of up to six weeks. Growers didn\u2019t know whether it was worth harvesting their crops. About 8 percent of California wine grapes in 2020 were left to rot. Winemakers are no strangers to the vicissitudes wrought by climate change . Warmer temperatures have been a boon to some in traditionally cooler regions who are rejoicing over riper berries\u2014but devastating to others. Scorching heat waves, wildfires , and other climate-driven calamities have ruined harvests in Europe, North America, Australia, and elsewhere. And as 2020 showed, climate change can take its toll on grapes without directly destroying them. Wildfires and warmer temperatures can transform the flavor of wine, whose quality and very identity depends on the delicate chemistry of grapes and the conditions they\u2019re grown in. Many growers and winemakers are increasingly concerned that climate change is robbing wines of their defining flavors, even spoiling vintages entirely. \u201cThat\u2019s the big worry,\u201d says Karen MacNeil, a wine expert living in Napa Valley and author of The Wine Bible . \u201cThat\u2019s the heartbeat of wine\u2014it\u2019s connected to its place.\u201d The greatest challenge that climate change brings to winemaking is unpredictability, MacNeil says. Producers used to know which varieties to grow, how to grow them, when to harvest the berries, and how to ferment them to produce a consistent, quality wine\u2014but today, every step is up in the air. This growing recognition is spurring researchers and winemakers to find ways to preserve beloved grape varieties and their unique qualities under the shifting and capricious conditions of today\u2019s warming world. To learn about the threats to our favorite beverage, we spoke with wine experts from two renowned wine regions\u2014Bordeaux in France, and California\u2014to understand how climate change is uprooting their traditional vines and wines, and traveled to the University of California, Davis, and nearby Napa Valley in late 2021 to speak with scientists, growers, and winemakers. We were treated to an inside look at how every stage of winemaking is transforming to preserve desired flavors and aromas\u2014and yes, got to taste a lot of wine, from the finest Cabernet Sauvignon to samples spoiled by smoke and scorching heat. Weather extremes can kill even the hardiest vines, but much of the climate threat is an invisible one: chemical changes in the berries. That\u2019s because wine quality, at its most granular, boils down to achieving balance between three broad aspects of berries: sugar, acid, and secondary compounds. Sugar builds up in berries as vines photosynthesize, and acid levels decrease as the grapes ripen. Secondary compounds\u2014basically, chemicals beyond those essential to the plant\u2019s core metabolism\u2014accumulate over the season. Ones called anthocyanins give red grapes their color and help protect the plant against some types of UV rays. Others called tannins give wines bitterness and an astringent, drying mouthfeel; to the vines, they offer defense against grazing animals and other pests. These components, and therefore wine flavor, are affected by numerous environmental factors, including soil types, rainfall levels, and fog, all of which are encompassed in the French word terroir . Climate\u2014long-term patterns of temperature and precipitation\u2014is the biggest factor in terroir, Oberholster says. When a region\u2019s climate changes, that can disrupt the balance of sugar, acid, and secondary compounds by changing the rate at which they develop over the growing season, says Megan Bartlett, a plant biologist studying viticulture at UC Davis. In grapes, like in most fruit, there is a decrease in acidity and an increase in the amount of sugar as they ripen. At warmer temperatures, ripening is supercharged, leading to sweet, raisin-like flavor in grapes. Yeasts consume those sugars during fermentation and excrete alcohol, so fermenting sweeter berries leads to higher wine alcohol content\u2014and, indeed, wines in warm regions such as southern France are growing boozier . That\u2019s an undesirable trend for the region\u2019s consumers, especially since it\u2019s accompanied by a drop in acidity, says C\u00e9cile Ha, a spokesperson for the Bordeaux Wine Council. Acidity affords a fresh fruitiness and ensures that wines last for years in the cellar. In some wines, higher alcohol creates a burning taste and masks subtle aromas, says Carolyn Ross, a food scientist at Washington State University who cataloged wine-aroma compounds in the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology .\u202fBoozier wines also tend to taste spicier. And so, as the weather gets hotter, \u201cyou\u2019re getting pushed more and more towards that Zinfandel style,\u201d Bartlett says. \u201cWhich is great if Zinfandel is what you\u2019re going for. But if you\u2019ve planted Pinot or you\u2019ve planted Cab, you\u2019re no longer really expressing the best version of that variety.\u201d If the story were simply about sugar and acid, the solution would be relatively simple: Harvest grapes earlier, before they turn too sweet and while they still retain their tartness. But growers also want that stew of secondary compounds to build up, because these create the layered aromas key to quality wines. This can force wine producers to choose between harvesting early without fully developed tannins and anthocyanins or harvesting later when berries are loaded with those compounds but are overly sweet as well. All things being equal, the changes in grapes due to warmer growing temperatures bring out more ripe, or \u201ccooked,\u201d flavors in wine. MacNeil puts the progression this way: \u201can unripe cherry, to an almost-ripe cherry, to a ripe cherry, to cherry juice, to cherries that have been cooked down on the top of a stove like if you\u2019re going to make a pie, to dried cherries that are almost like raisins.\u201d For wines from warmer spots, climate change is worrisome because they\u2019re at risk of losing their sense of place as more and more wines become raisiny. (\u201cAll raisins taste the same,\u201d says MacNeil.) A blurring between wines is already affecting the industry, fueled by warmer temperatures and greater weather unpredictability, as well as by increased exchanges of growing techniques. It\u2019s made the\u00a0 Master Sommelier Diploma exams\u2014a vexingly difficult series of tests that include guessing a wine\u2019s variety, year, and region\u2014even harder. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are older masters of wine and master sommeliers who will tell you that if they had to take that exam now, especially the tasting exam, they would never pass it,\u201d MacNeil says. These shifts in wine flavor are subtle in comparison to that other dreaded climate impact: smoke taint. While a little smokiness imparted from, say, barrel-aging, might enhance a wine, this is a \u201cvery characteristic ashtray character at the back of your throat,\u201d as Oberholster describes it, with notes such as \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and \u201cmedicinal.\u201d Compounds called free volatile phenols, produced when wood is burned, seep into grapes, and accumulate mainly in the skins. The phenols are bound up with sugars into odorless compounds called glycosides\u2014until fermentation, when some of these phenols break free, imparting the distinct, overpowering flavor. (The breakdown continues in bottle or barrel and mouth.) The taste is most pronounced when the berries are bathed in fresh smoke rather than older smoke. The experience is \u201cretronasal,\u201d meaning the aroma rises into your sinuses once the wine is on your tongue; it\u2019s estimated that about 20 percent of people can\u2019t taste it. It\u2019s primarily a threat to red wines, because reds are fermented with the grape skins. The recent surge of intense wildfires, worsened by climate change, has made Napa growers anxious each year as the fall grape harvest approaches. Since 2017, heavy smoke has hovered over Napa vineyards most years. Worried grape growers have reached out to Oberholster for guidance, and the chemist has fermented numerous test batches exposed to varying levels of smoke. On the day that we meet with her, Oberholster takes us to a 24,000-bottle-capacity library of wine at the UC Davis Robert Mondavi Institute. She tracks down two reds from the stacks, handing us the 2020 vintages. One is a moderately tainted wine from grapes exposed to a week of smoke from the Glass Fire; the other is a heavily tainted fermentation from grapes that endured smoke from a large complex of lightning-triggered fires that edged right up to the vineyard that same year. Later on, we conduct an informal but blind taste test back at Ula\u2019s kitchen table in Reno. Compared alongside a Kirkland Signature Cabernet Sauvignon, the tainted wines have a campfire-like smokiness that Katya experiences mostly as a smell, while Ula also feels a burn at the back of her throat. \u201cDrinking burnt wood,\u201d Ula jots down in her notebook, of the smokier vintage. Smoke taint is gross, shrieking its presence even to amateurs like us. But many winemakers are also worried about the subtler ways that climate change threatens the flavor and identity of their products. In readiness, producers and researchers in warmer regions are learning how to adapt their vineyards, their winemaking, and the very vines themselves. In Bordeaux, for example, the traditional style for red wines is full-bodied with strong fruity aromas and a \u201cpencil lead\u201d earthiness . But earlier springs mean that the grapes of traditional varieties mature during the peak of summer rather than in the fall, generating lots of sugars, fewer acids, and undesirable changes in aromas. To identify grape types that are better adapted to warmer climates and still produce wine with Bordeaux flavors, agronomist Agn\u00e8s Destrac-Irvine of the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment and her colleagues recently concluded a decade-long study of 52 varieties from other regions. Working with wine producers, they settled on four red and two white vine types that fit the bill. And in a remarkable move for French authorities, which have long allowed only six traditional red and eight traditional white grape varieties to be cultivated, in 2021 they formally authorized Bordeaux wine producers to try out the new ones \u2014as long as they don\u2019t represent more than 10 percent of a final wine blend. These newcomers add fresh tools to winemakers\u2019 palettes so they can balance out the effects of climate change in Bordeaux blends, Destrac-Irvine says. One of them, the French variety Arinarnoa, can boost acidity and tannin levels; another, the Portuguese Touriga Nacional, can ramp up powerful black-fruit aromas that heat-sensitive varieties might lose. \u201cIf you have more colors,\u201d says Ha of the Bordeaux Wine Council, \u201cmaybe it will give you more possibilities to paint.\u201d But approving the chosen six is on a trial basis only: In Bordeaux, where growers have tended vines for some 2,000 years, the idea of new varieties is terrifying, says Gregory Gambetta, a plant biologist at Bordeaux Sciences Agro and the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin. The traditional ones are just so closely intertwined with the region\u2019s culture and history that, \u201cfrankly,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be much better if we could adapt the system using other levers.\u201d And so Gambetta and others are trying to do just that: study how to climate-proof vines by using different rootstocks, which are usually of a different variety anyway. Rootstocks control a plant\u2019s overall vigor and water use, so if these are selected to tolerate the warming world, the plant\u2019s aboveground variety\u2014which determines the unique chemistry and flavor of the grapes\u2014can still be used and thrive. One sunny and warm day in November 2021, UC Davis viticulture researcher Kaan Kurtural leads us to a plot of vines at the Oakville Experimental Vineyard in Napa Valley, nestled between the forest-coated hills near other, commercial vineyards. Since 2016, Kurtural and colleagues have been monitoring 16 unique combinations of rootstocks and Cabernet Sauvignon clones to learn which combinations are most resilient under stressful conditions like heat waves and drought while still producing high-quality Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. Some of the experimental grafts\u2014including one with a French rootstock called 420A\u2014clearly look wilted, and, after just five years, some of them are dead. But others\u2014including ones grafted onto the rootstock Kober 5 BB, the French 3309 Couderc, and 110 Richter\u2014look more vigorous and leafier. Andy Beckstoffer, a prominent winegrower in Napa who is working with Kurtural on a similar trial at one of his own vineyards, tells us he thinks the results will be a boon to Cabernet Sauvignon in the coming years. \u201cHopefully, we will come up with new combinations that address climate change and also improve wine quality,\u201d he says. Growers across the world already are changing traditional practices to temper the effects of a warming climate. Grapes are often harvested earlier in the year to prevent overripening and, in fire-prone regions, to miss the worst of wildfire season and avoid smoke taint. Ha explained that Bordeaux workers now rush to pick berries in the early morning when acidity is highest, and they trim bushy plants to curb sugar production. At the Oakville research station, Kurtural shows us experiment after experiment investigating the effects of different viticultural practices, including a carbon-sucking grass that can grow between rows and vines tied up to wires in numerous trellising styles. Fortunately for places like drought-bedeviled California, the solution isn\u2019t simply more water; his research suggests that the most balanced and aromatic wines come from vines that are under constant, mild water stress .\u202fTackling the sun\u2019s radiation might be a better way forward. \u201cSome regions of the spectra can be damaging, such as near-infrared light,\u201d he\u2019d explained earlier\u2014they heat up the plant and the berries. At the vineyard, he leads us to a patch of Cabernet Sauvignon vines that have spent the past two seasons under parasol-like shade films. The films slow the ripening process and don\u2019t seem to affect how many berries the vines produce. We get to taste the difference on the same trip, at a conference on wine research at UC Davis . There, Lauren Marigliano, one of Kurtural\u2019s graduate students, presents a chemistry analysis of grapes fully exposed to the sun or protected by different types of shade. Afterward, she provides wine samples from three treatments for the audience of researchers, growers, and winemakers to try. Around us, professionals swirl their glasses, sniff, take sips, and then spit into little plastic buckets. We watch their technique and gingerly follow suit. The first wine is quite bitter, and the second one tastes less complex\u2014a nearby expert declares it unfortunately \u201csquare.\u201d We take a liking to the third one, which has a bolder berry aroma and a smoother taste. Attendees murmur approvingly at its \u201croundness.\u201d That \u201cround\u201d one, it turns out, came from grapes grown under a shade film that blocked around 30 percent of near-infrared light, the wavelengths most responsible for heat transmission. By cooling the grapes, the film allowed them to accumulate higher concentrations of heat-sensitive anthocyanins than the grapes for the first and second samples. One of those was grown with a less effective shade film that blocked a different set of wavelengths, the other with no film at all. The winning film still let through enough light for sun-dependent compounds to build up, creating a fuller-bodied, more complete red wine, Marigliano tells the audience. But it\u2019s not always economical for farmers to erect long films along their rows of vines, especially over large acreages. That\u2019s where trellising comes in. During our tour of the experimental vineyard, Kurtural pauses at one point to gesture at a row of vines snaking along a single, high-hanging wire. This style of trellising works similarly to a good shade film by allowing the vine leaves themselves to shade the fruit, he explains. Practices like shade films and grape-shielding trellising had previously mostly been limited to Australia, South America, Israel, and Spain. \u201cNow, with climate change, there\u2019s 30 years-ish of good research on warm climate viticulture that\u2019s all of a sudden relevant to places like Burgundy, Beaujolais, Germany, Napa, and Sonoma,\u201d says Steve Matthiasson, a wine producer from Napa Valley who has adopted shade cloth. He\u2019s also planted his vines in a northeast-to-southwest orientation so that the sun shines directly on top of the vines, leaving the fruit protected by the leaves. \u201cNapa,\u201d he marvels, \u201cwas a cool-climate growing region one generation ago.\u201d Even the toughest grapes can\u2019t always withstand extreme heat and smoke. So researchers and wine producers are also developing ways to work with climate-affected crops and still make well-rounded wines. Oberholster reckons that many of the vines left unharvested after the massive 2020 California fires could still have produced good wine, so she encourages growers to do small-scale \u201c bucket fermentations \u201d a few weeks before harvest to test for smoke taint\u2014since fermentation releases those ashtray-tasting phenols. Growers can then send a wine sample to a lab for analysis and taste the micro-batches themselves\u2014they might pick up changes that a commercial lab would miss, since the labs only screen for a limited menu of compounds and could pronounce a wine to be fine when it\u2019s not. It can also help, adds Oberholster, to sweeten smoky wine with a little grape concentrate\u2014that way, the extra sugar blocks enzymes in the mouth from releasing phenols. Even better would be removing the phenols altogether, but today\u2019s treatments, which include activated carbon and reverse osmosis, target a wide class of smoky compounds. So\u2014inevitably\u2014they also take away some desirable aromas. To that end, Oberholster is screening enzymes used in the food and beverage industries to find ones that might help break down the undesired compounds in wine and render them easier to filter out. Wine-blending techniques can also help. Beckstoffer, for example, says that his 2020 smoke-tainted grapes were fermented and, when blended with untainted wines, \u201cmay not go into a $200 bottle of wine, but a lot of them could go into a $40 bottle of wine.\u201d And Matthiasson carefully blends varieties to balance flavors: He picks Cabernet Sauvignon early in the season to preserve acidity, but that also means the grapes have less tongue-smothering richness, or mid-palate. So he mixes in Petit Verdot grapes to pump up the mid-palate and Cabernet Franc to fill in the gaps in herbal aromas. He\u2019s also planted an emergency stash of the Sagrantino variety\u2014\u201cfor 20 years down the road\u201d\u2014which is rich in the tannins that Cabernet Sauvignon grapes lose during warmer nights. Warmer temperatures threaten Matthiasson\u2019s preferred style: wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity than many of the full-bodied ones popular now. But he doesn\u2019t think that raisin-like wine everywhere is inevitable. In fact, some suggest that much of the rise in stronger, sweeter wines is a choice driven by vintners and consumer demand, not solely due to warming climates. \u201cI get very frustrated by winemakers using climate change as an excuse for overripe, rich, jammy wine when it\u2019s not,\u201d he says. Winemaking is also going high-tech to adapt to climate change. In France, microbiologist Fabienne Remize of the University of Montpellier has engineered novel strains of yeast that produce less alcohol during fermentation, to circumvent the too-much-sugar issue. Scientists have also developed an electrodialysis process that can dial up the acidity of wine by removing ions like potassium from it; the method has been adopted by winemakers in France, Morocco, and Spain. The biggest question for climate-changed wine and the adaptations that researchers and wine producers come up with is, of course: Will people keep buying and enjoying it? One of the more surprising lessons from consumer research is this embrace of bolder and jammier wines, as Kurtural and Gambetta have noted. In one study of red wines from Napa and Bordeaux, they found that wine ratings have actually risen over the last 60 years , even as those regions have warmed. The findings, they wrote, seem to quash a previous prediction that quality would peak at a specific growing season temperature \u2014which both regions have long since surpassed. Still, Kurtural and Gambetta also note we might be reaching a tipping point where warmer temperatures wear away secondary compounds beyond the ability of growers to adapt. \u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t know what the optimum is,\u201d Gambetta says. \u201cWe need better tools and better analysis to find out how far is too far.\u201d Matthiasson, for his part, thinks that fine wines will weather the warming climate. With his shade cloths, blending techniques, and emergency Sagrantino stash, he\u2019s ready for what comes next. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be able to adapt,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the short term, our pace of learning is faster than the pace of climate change.\u201d","headline":"Full-Bodied With Notes of Band-Aid and Medicine","article_name":661396.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/06\/glass-fire-climate-change-impact-wine\/661396\/","date_published":"2022-06-26 12:00:00","article_length":21598,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:37.348465","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/06\/glass-fire-climate-change-impact-wine\/661396\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"For nearly 30 years, America\u2019s four biggest rail companies\u2014which move the majority of the country\u2019s coal\u2014have spent millions to deny climate science and block climate policy. In the fight against climate change, the nation\u2019s freight railroads have painted themselves as heroes. Rail is the \u201cthe most environmentally friendly way\u201d to move cargo over land, says the Association of American Railroads, the industry\u2019s trade group. The industry\u2019s four biggest companies agree: \u201cRailroads are essential to moving [climate] objectives forward,\u201d says CSX Transportation, the largest railroad east of the Mississippi. Yet for almost 30 years, the biggest players in the freight-rail industry have waged a campaign to discredit climate science and oppose almost any federal climate policy, reveals new research analyzed by The Atlantic . The four largest American freight railroads\u2014BNSF Railway, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and CSX\u2014have sat at the center of the climate-denial movement nearly since it began, documents and studies show. These four companies have joined or funded groups that attacked individual scientists, cast doubt on scientific consensus, and rejected reports from major scientific institutions, including the United Nations\u2013led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Their effort has cost at least tens of millions of dollars and outlasted individual leaders and coalitions. It continues to this day. The four companies are members of a powerful pro-coal trade association that in 2014 called climate change a \u201chypothesis\u201d and argued that carbon dioxide\u2014the air pollutant that causes global warming\u2014was as much as 400 times more beneficial to humanity than it was harmful. \u201cWe can now identify railroads as an integral component of opposition to climate action,\u201d Robert Brulle , an author of the new research and a professor of sociology and environmental science at Drexel University, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind about that.\u201d Why did railroads invest millions in climate-science denial? Perhaps because coal makes up almost one of every three tons of American rail freight. Nearly 70 percent of American coal is shipped by rail, often along \u201cdedicated\u201d lines that can \u201coperate around the clock,\u201d the rail association says on its website. The largest class of railroads made a combined $10.7 billion, or 14 percent of their revenue, hauling coal last year. So while rail companies say they emitted only about 0.6 percent of U.S. greenhouse-gas pollution last year, their indirect carbon footprint may be gargantuan. If you take emissions embedded into coal into account, the railroads facilitated 16.5 percent of total U.S. carbon pollution last year, according to calculations by Rob Jackson , a geoscience professor at Stanford. That\u2019s more carbon pollution than was released last year by all the farms in the United States, or by all the domestic flights, or by all the commercial and residential buildings. In separate statements, the four railroads said they were committed to sustainability, and noted, correctly, that rail is the most efficient form of ground transportation. CSX said that, as \u201ccommon carriers,\u201d railroads are required by law to move \u201call forms of energy.\u201d BNSF and Union Pacific \u2014the two dominant railroads in the American West\u2014explicitly rejected the premise that they had fostered climate denial: BNSF\u2019s statement said it \u201chas never denied the science or existence of climate change,\u201d and Union Pacific said it has not worked to delay climate policy, noting that it has \u201cacknowledged the changing environment and climate risk in public filings since 2007, while reporting fuel consumption and greenhouse gas reduction initiatives in [filings] since 2009.\u201d But railroads\u2019 efforts to keep coal burning\u2014and all those tons of carbon flowing into the sky\u2014have been hidden in plain sight for decades. Two new studies unearthed their influence this fall. The first , by Brulle, compiled 25 years of data about companies and nonprofits involved in \u201cthe organized efforts to oppose meaningful climate action,\u201d he said. He found that the railroads kept appearing in crucial coalitions that blocked policy and pushed climate-science denial. His results, published in the journal Sociological Inquiry in October, showed that railroads often waged this fight alongside other coal-dependent companies, including steelmakers, electric utilities, and coal-mining firms themselves. Brulle now argues that this \u201ccoal-utilities-rail-steel sector\u201d makes up an important but little known coalition opposed to climate action. The second study was conducted by researchers who were not alive when the railroads\u2019 campaign began. A team at Brown University analyzed the four major railroads\u2019 ongoing political activity. It found that they are members of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , or ACCCE, a pro-coal group that touts the \u201csocial benefits\u201d of carbon pollution. ACCCE has also recently lobbied for a federal bailout of coal plants and celebrated the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. Since 2012, three of the railroads have paid ACCCE a combined total of at least $3 million to lobby on their behalf, according to their own disclosure forms. Those same railroads\u2014CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific\u2014have also given at least $28 million to other groups that oppose climate policy, including the Association of American Railroads and the National Association of Manufacturers. The fourth and largest railroad, BNSF Railway, does not disclose any funds it gives to trade associations for lobbying expenditures, in accordance with the policy of Berkshire Hathaway, its owner. What inspired the Brown study? As Cole Triedman, the report\u2019s lead researcher, told me: \u201cThis was literally for a class.\u201d For the past three months, Triedman, who is 20, has worked with three other undergraduates to study the political activity of coal-dependent companies as part of a seminar on \u201cEngaged Climate Policy.\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t know how they pass their other classes, honestly, let alone sleep or have a life,\u201d J. Timmons Roberts , their instructor and the Ittleson Professor of Environmental Studies at Brown, told me.) The students\u2014Triedman; Andrew Javens, 20; Jessie Sugarman, 22; and David Wingate, 22\u2014collated political-spending disclosures from corporate and nonprofit disclosures. They also used data from the Energy Information Administration to piece together the supply chains of roughly 25 of the country\u2019s largest coal-fired power plants. \u201cTracking the mine to the power plant, we found that an elite cohort of coal companies is dealing with an elite cohort of rail companies,\u201d Triedman said. (I confirmed their research on political spending with Michael Beckel , the research director of Issue One, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics.) The rail industry has \u201cbeen incredibly effective in hiding behind the veil of their own cultural capital for decades,\u201d Triedman said. The Association of American Railroads has participated in \u201ceight of the most effective and toxically regressive, really harmful climate-denial front groups over the last three decades.\u201d But it has not mentioned climate change in any public statement in recent years, and its website does not use the phrase climate change. The Association of American Railroads \u201cand its member railroads take seriously their responsibilities as stewards of the environment, which is why railroads continue to implement numerous measures to reduce their carbon footprint,\u201d said Kristin Smith , its senior vice president, in a statement. \u201cEfforts to strengthen the industry\u2019s environmental performance in light of climate change have been noted as a success by the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index among others. Specifically, railroads in recent years have deployed low emissions equipment and idle reduction technologies, increased fuel efficiency via fuel management systems, and many more initiatives.\u201d She added that it had been \u201cnearly twenty years\u201d since the association was a member of \u201cthe majority of the organizations\u201d that Triedman was referring to. The scope of the railroads\u2019s role surprised even experts, says Geoffrey Supran , a Harvard researcher of global-warming politics, who was not involved in the new analysis. It\u2019s now clear that railroads were \u201ccentral\u201d to the effort to deny climate science and delay policy, he told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not peripheral. These are key cogs in a multidecade, well-oiled, well-funded denial machine. This is a big deal.\u201d By the beginning of the 1990s, much of today\u2019s climate science was already clear to researchers. In the first year of that decade, the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2014in its first-ever report\u2014 warned that \u201chuman-caused emissions of carbon dioxide\u201d were disturbing the climate. If humanity failed to slow and stop this pollution, global average temperatures could, by 2025, rise by 1 degree Celsius. (This prediction turned out to be too optimistic .) The rail industry\u2019s first strike against this consensus came in 1991, when its trade group\u2014the Association of American Railroads\u2014joined the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, an early consortium of automakers and their allies that opposed increasing federal gas-mileage standards. That group called concerns about climate change \u201cridiculous and dangerous.\u201d Read: The true cost of coal The following year, the rail association joined the now defunct Global Climate Coalition, or GCC, the broadest and most powerful of the denial front groups in the 1990s\u2014\u201cthe very heart of the denial machine,\u201d as Supran called it. In 1995, when the IPCC released its second report, it found that the evidence suggested a \u201cdiscernible human influence\u201d on the climate. The GCC pounced. It attacked Benjamin Santer, one of the report\u2019s lead American authors, falsely accusing him of misleading the public by concealing scientific uncertainty. In fact, the IPCC report spent considerable space discussing and quantifying scientific uncertainty. The GCC also said the panel was guilty of \u201cinstitutionalized \u2018scientific cleansing.\u2019\u201d This was a \u201cdisgusting and not-so-subtle reference,\u201d Supran said, to \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d the euphemism for genocide used in the Bosnian War a few years earlier. The Association of American Railroads helped lead the GCC through this period. Richard Briggs, then the executive vice president of the rail association, was the GCC\u2019s chairman in 1995, and Edwin Harper, the rail association\u2019s president, was GCC\u2019s secretary in 1996, according to IRS documents . All four of the big railroads were themselves members of the GCC in one or both of those years. In 1997, the GCC spent more than $13 million on ads opposing the Kyoto Protocol, an international climate treaty. When President George W. Bush formally withdrew from Kyoto in 2001, a senior State Department official told GCC that it had changed history: Bush \u201crejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you,\u201d she wrote in a memo. During this period, the railroads joined other groups opposed to climate science and policy, many of which had a specifically pro-coal bent. By 1996, all four railroads and the rail association had joined one such group, the Center for Energy and Economic Development. CEED attacked the basics of climate science, falsely claiming that carbon dioxide was \u201cNOT a pollutant\u201d while asserting that \u201cglobal warming theory\u201d was \u201cbased on a computer model.\u201d The railroads and their trade group remained in the organization for 11 years. In 2007, they joined another pro-coal group, Americans for Balanced Energy Choices. Formed in part to fight a bipartisan climate bill coming together in the Senate, it spent $35 million on ads that showed images like \u201ca power cord being plugged into a lump of coal,\u201d according to The  Washington Post . Both of these groups often used a misleading phrase, clean coal . The problem is that clean coal does not, in any wide-scale sense, exist. Every coal-fired power plant on the grid in the United States releases billowfuls of air pollution\u2014with one exception. In the past few years, a single plant in Texas has claimed that it has cut carbon pollution by 90 percent. But the cost of that upgrade came at $1 billion, and nearly half of that funding came from the federal government as well as foreign governments. Read: Dirt coal, clean future These same groups also argued that coal was cleaner than it had been in the past, eliding the difference between toxic air pollution (which has decreased from coal) and carbon pollution (which has not). And environmental regulation\u2014which those same groups usually opposed\u2014is a main reason toxic air pollution has fallen. In 2008, the two pro-coal groups merged, forming the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. The four railways and their trade group joined that year. ACCCE would play a fateful role in climate policy. In 2009, as Congress was debating an aggressive bill to reduce carbon emissions, Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia received a memorable letter from the leader of the local NAACP office. The letter revealed an intimacy with arcane electricity data that would make an energy lobbyist shiver with pleasure. \u201cOur state gets 56% of its electricity from coal,\u201d it told Perriello, a first-term Democrat in a vulnerable seat. It asked him to amend the legislation to \u201cprotect minorities and all your constituents from unaffordable energy cost increases.\u201d Soon, nearly identical letters arrived from other local civil-rights groups. The letters were fake\u2014forged by a public-relations firm subcontracting for the clean-coal coalition. The coalition had learned about the fake letters within days of their being sent out, but said nothing until after representatives had voted on the bill, a congressional investigation later found . In the years since, ACCCE has pushed outright denial of climate science. In 2014, it published a report that called human-caused climate change a \u201chypothesis\u201d and \u201cdebate.\u201d It claimed that the future benefits of carbon pollution may exceed its costs by \u201c400-to-1\u201d\u2014arguing, essentially, that climate change might be an overwhelmingly good thing for humanity. Increased atmospheric carbon would be a \u201cbiospheric benefit,\u201d it said. And it falsely asserted that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide was \u201cexerting no discernible influence on the rate of sea-level rise.\u201d (In fact, the IPCC had found a year earlier that sea-level rise was speeding up .) Since 2017, ACCCE has lobbied in support of President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to bail out coal plants. It has also celebrated Trump\u2019s repeal of the Clean Power Plan, which would have dramatically cut U.S. carbon pollution. Read: Trump\u2019s coal bailout is dead In a statement, Michelle Bloodworth, the president and CEO of ACCCE, said the organization \u201chas never opposed climate change policies for scientific reasons; when necessary we have worked to highlight the potential adverse economic impacts of proposed policies.\u201d She also said that ACCCE had a new name: America\u2019s Power. ( The group\u2019s website uses both names.) \u201cThe members of America\u2019s Power are committed to working with policymakers to help maintain the nation\u2019s fleet of coal-fueled power plants,\u201d she added, saying that coal provides \u201cfuel security\u201d and \u201cgrid resilience,\u201d and ensures a \u201cdiverse portfolio of electricity resources.\u201d There are no electricity companies in ACCCE. Last week, its final two utility members fled the group under investor pressure. The Association of American Railroads also left ACCCE in 2015. But all four rail companies are still members. None of the four railroads revealed any plans to leave ACCCE when directly asked by The Atlantic . And since ACCCE touted the \u201csocial benefits\u201d of carbon pollution in 2014, Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have paid it more than $2 million to lobby on their behalf, according to their own voluntary disclosures. It is \u201clikely\u201d that the railroads\u2019 spending in ACCCE and other groups actually exceeds that amount, Michael Beckel, the expert on money in politics, told me. The three railroads are not forced by law to disclose most of their spending in trade associations, so \u201ceach company gets to dictate the terms of what they want to share,\u201d he said. Apart from ACCCE, rail companies have also tried to block states from passing climate policy. BNSF, CSX, and Norfolk Southern spent a total of $85,000 to oppose a 2012 ballot referendum in Michigan that would have required local utilities to get more power from renewable sources. Voters rejected the initiative. Over the past decade, researchers have revealed the extensive scope of efforts to muddy the public\u2019s understanding of climate change. Historians, activists, and state attorneys general have focused mostly on the role played by ExxonMobil and other oil and gas companies. \u201cIn many ways, the rail industry\u2019s track record of funding \u2018denial and delay\u2019 tracks the record of the fossil-fuel industry itself,\u201d Geoffrey Supran told me. In at least one crucial respect, though, the railroads differ from Exxon. By the late 1970s, climate scientists at Exxon had told executives about the risks of global warming, according to a 2015 Pulitzer-nominated report from InsideClimate News . Exxon then launched an \u201cambitious\u201d internal research program that was able, by 1982, to confirm the basics of climate science ; one lab director warned that it was \u201cdistinctly possible\u201d that rising carbon pollution would have \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences by 2030. But Exxon ramped down that research in the late 1980s, the report found. It then helped found and lead the Global Climate Coalition. (Earlier this week, a New York judge ruled that Exxon had not misled its investors when communicating about climate science and policy.) There is no evidence that the rail companies rejected their internal scientific assessments of climate science in the same way. Yet climate science was a well-developed field by the time the rail industry\u2019s campaign began. More than 25 years earlier, President Lyndon B. Johnson warned that coal and other fossil fuels could \u201cmodify the heat balance of the atmosphere.\u201d And scientists and engineers within the coal industry itself fretted over the risks of climate change as early as 1966, a recent investigation in HuffPost found . \u201cThere is evidence that the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth\u2019s atmosphere is increasing rapidly as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels,\u201d the president of Bituminous Coal Research wrote in a mining trade publication that year. \u201cSuch changes in temperature will cause melting of the polar icecaps, which, in turn, would result in the inundation of many coastal cities.\u201d An engineer at Peabody Coal, one of the world\u2019s largest coal-mining companies, responded to that article in the same issue of the journal. Coal firms were \u201cin effect, \u2018buying time\u2019\u201d until federal pollution rules got stricter, he said. \u201cWe must use that time productively to find answers to the many unsolved problems.\u201d Coal use in the United States has halved since 2005, according to research published this month by Rob Jackson and his colleagues. Today, no new coal-fired power plants are under construction anywhere in America. *Collage photographs by: Alan R Harris \/ Camilo Morales \/ catnap72 \/ Hulton Archive \/ Ken Petch \/ Smoky Shin \/ Getty","headline":"A Major but Little-Known Supporter of Climate Denial: Freight Railroads","article_name":603559.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/freight-railroads-funded-climate-denial-decades\/603559\/","date_published":"2019-12-13 17:43:47","article_length":19322,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:37.775892","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/freight-railroads-funded-climate-denial-decades\/603559\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Understanding global warming intellectually is not the same as feeling its presence in your daily life\u2014or seeing photos of a 50-foot wall of fire. Last summer the temperature in London, where I live, climbed above 37 degrees Celsius \u2014or 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was hotter outside my body than it was inside it. To someone raised under the sodden, used-tissue skies of Britain, that felt like an offense against nature. Everywhere I went, I felt the same constricting, breathless sensation. The heat was like a prison; I had been sentenced to 100 degrees. Stuck at home all day because of COVID-19 shutdowns, I worked with my feet in a bucket of cold water, in front of a fan turned up to what I nicknamed the \u201c Shakira setting .\u201d Britain\u2019s homes and office spaces weren\u2019t designed with high temperatures in mind; unlike in the Mediterranean and other hot climates, our buildings aren\u2019t typically made with thick walls and shutters to keep out sunlight. Mechanical air-conditioning is unusual in private homes because we already have air-conditioning. We call it rain . Britain might be a rich, developed country, but that doesn\u2019t make it ready for climate change. Last summer was the first time I can remember thinking, before catching myself, that I couldn\u2019t wait for Britain\u2019s weather to go back to normal. A body-heat-level summer will always be normal. This is the world that fossil fuels made, a world where \u201cfreak\u201d weather is not freakish. In the past year alone, wildfires in Australia affected 3 billion animals ; cities in Pakistan and India surpassed 120 degrees Fahrenheit , a temperature so hot that the roads started to melt; people died of heatstroke in Portland, Oregon ; the London Underground turned into a log flume; the air in Montana was so full of smoke that, according to one resident, you chewed it rather than breathed it ; and killer \u201c megafloods \u201d swept away riverside homes in Germany. Some of the strange weather that people around the world have experienced recently is just that: weather. Natural variations in temperature and moisture. But you can live through only so many \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d rainstorms or heat waves before concluding that they are not once in a lifetime after all. Something is very wrong. Climate change no longer feels like an abstract problem for the future, like an asteroid hitting the Earth or a super-earthquake wiping out the Pacific Northwest . I am scared now . I\u2019ve reached my personal tipping point. Read: 2050 is closer than 1990 Understanding a problem intellectually is not the same as feeling its presence in your daily life. Like anyone who reads the news, I\u2019ve been aware of climate change for years, during which the subject bobbed in and out of my field of vision. Like many journalists, I wondered how to make a subject so enormous, and so terrifying, connect with busy people living busy lives. The torrent of disaster footage from around the world has answered that question for me. \u201cEnvironmentalism\u201d sounded woolly and tree-hugging when I read it or wrote it. \u201cClimate change\u201d sounded antiseptic and bloodless. \u201cLook at that 50-foot wall of fire \u201d might just do the trick. Every time I listen to blowhard TV presenters waffling about the dire \u201c hockey-stick graph ,\u201d or oil executives soliciting praise for their company\u2019s pitiful efforts to address the problem, or politicians falsely telling the public that we can keep consuming as much as we do, I will mentally Photoshop their babbling faces in front of the scenes from Greece , Turkey , or California this past weekend. Let\u2019s see how convincing they sound over B-roll of a literal inferno. The scientific consensus is clear that climate change is real, and it is equally clear that major action is needed to avoid further catastrophe. A new report from the International Panel on Climate Change warns that rising global temperatures are inevitable, that only a major reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions this decade can prevent climate breakdown, and that some changes may already be \u201cirreversible.\u201d I wince when I read reports like that, because of the danger that such news will prompt apathy rather than action. We\u2019re all doomed, so why bother fighting it? Read: A catastrophic new climate report What has given me hope, oddly enough, is the coronavirus pandemic. In less than two years, scientists have created multiple vaccines against a previously unknown disease, and governments have begun to distribute them worldwide. Yes, the vaccine rollout suffers from the same problems that climate policy does; the richest countries attend to their own needs first. (Constant high temperatures are especially dangerous in countries where people have to work outside and can\u2019t afford air-conditioning to cool themselves at night. Floods are made worse by cheap, unprotected housing. Wildfires rage more fiercely where the local population lacks enough fire trucks to tackle them.) But the lesson of the coronavirus is that proximity to disaster can change minds, even among those who feel that living in a rich country can insulate them from harm. Contrast the vaccine take-up in Australia and Britain. In the former, the rollout has been sluggish . The government closed the borders early and infections have stayed low, and many Australians have therefore been reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, because of early concerns about a rare clotting reaction. Why not wait for supplies from Pfizer or Moderna? Here in Britain, which has counted more than 150,000 deaths from COVID-19, most people couldn\u2019t get the vaccine\u2014any vaccine\u2014into their arms fast enough . For us, COVID-19 wasn\u2019t a 30-second news report about terrible things happening overseas. It was a 50-foot wall of fire in our own backyard. In the United States, vaccination rates have picked up quickly in the communities currently being ravaged by infections from the Delta variant. As the global climate becomes more obviously chaotic, the public\u2019s self-interest should accelerate what my colleague Robinson Meyer calls the \u201c green vortex \u201d\u2014the process by which institutions and initiatives tackle challenges such as decarbonization even without strong national climate policies. For businesses, the economic benefits of free-riding on the depletion of natural resources will soon be weighed against the cost and inconvenience of having your data center washed away in a flash flood. Read: The concession to climate change I will not make Despair about the climate should also be tempered by the advances we have already seen in the past decade. Here in Britain, stories about \u201cfreak\u201d weather now routinely mention climate change, stressing the connection between the two. The BBC documentaries by 95-year-old David Attenborough, a national treasure second only to the Queen, no longer merely show sad, skinny polar bears trying to hunt on melting ice; they explicitly discuss why the bears are so sad and skinny. (Attenborough\u2019s recent Netflix documentary is even more powerful, as he points out that when he was born in 1926, the planet was a full degree cooler.) Even avowedly contrarian publications have less tolerance for climate-change deniers, who were once treated as a spicy provocation to liberal sensibilities. The culture war over climate has burned out as the real world has caught on fire. I can only hope the United States follows this path too. I no longer feel like the dog in the cartoon , insisting that \u201cthis is fine.\u201d This isn\u2019t fine. We have messed up quite badly, for some noble reasons, such as lifting people out of poverty, and some less noble ones, such as enriching the shareholders of fossil-fuel companies. But the same ingenuity that got humanity here, the ingenuity that created the internal-combustion engine and the airplane and the power station and the megafarm, is what can save us. The impulse to procrastinate is understandable. Anyone who has written a book or cleaned out a garage will know the feeling: Simply by beginning such a project, you have committed yourself to an enormous amount of time and labor, so it\u2019s easier not to start at all. That\u2019s where politicians come in. Individual changes are no substitute for political action. Through subsidies and taxes, governments need to make the greenest option also the easiest one to take. Again, the surprise of the pandemic has been the high levels of compliance with shutdowns and mask mandates, despite isolated instances of rebellion making the news. The coronavirus didn\u2019t cause looting. Society didn\u2019t break down. In the face of existential threats, most of us are cooperative, kind, and resilient. Those qualities are what propelled a bunch of apes through an evolutionary journey that led to humans reaching the moon, splitting the atom, and creating RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race . The first thing to do is let the fear in, without letting it paralyze us. This isn\u2019t fine. So what do we do next?","headline":"I\u2019ve Hit My Climate Tipping Point","article_name":619700.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/08\/ipcc-report-my-climate-tipping-point\/619700\/","date_published":"2021-08-09 18:15:00","article_length":8894,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:38.346825","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/08\/ipcc-report-my-climate-tipping-point\/619700\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The country is not aiming for 60 percent of the populace to get COVID-19, but you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking so based on how badly the actual plan has been explained. Updated at 1:13 p.m. ET on March 16, 2020. There was a time when it seemed possible for the world to contain COVID-19\u2014the disease caused by the new coronavirus. That time is over. What began as an outbreak in China has become a pandemic, and as a growing number of countries struggle to control the virus, talk of \u201cflattening the curve\u201d is increasing. That is, a lot of people are going to get sick, and delaying infections as much as possible is imperative, so that cases occur over a long period of time and health systems aren\u2019t suddenly inundated. Almost every country is trying to achieve this goal through the standard arsenal of public health\u2014testing people and tracing contacts\u2014and through more restrictive measures that include instituting quarantines, closing public spaces, banning mass gatherings, and issuing strong advice about social distancing . But on Thursday, at a press conference , Boris Johnson seemingly revealed that the United Kingdom would adopt a different strategy. The government would no longer try to track and trace the contacts of every suspected case, and it would test only people who are admitted to hospitals. In lieu of any major social-distancing measures, Johnson instead offered a suite of soft advice\u2014people with symptoms should stay home; no school trips abroad; people over 70 should avoid cruises. Read: You\u2019re likely to get the coronavirus With the peak of the pandemic still weeks away, the time hadn\u2019t come yet for stricter measures, Johnson and his advisers said. They worried about \u201cbehavioral fatigue\u201d\u2014if restrictions come into force too early, people could become increasingly uncooperative and less vigilant, just as the outbreak swings into high gear. (As of yesterday, the U.K. has identified 1,391 cases, although thousands more are likely undetected.) And while suppressing the virus through draconian measures might be successful for months, when they lift, the virus will return, said Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K.\u2019s chief scientific adviser. To avoid a second peak in the winter, Vallance said the U.K. would suppress the virus \u201cbut not get rid of it completely,\u201d while focusing on protecting vulnerable groups, such as the elderly. In the meantime, other people would get sick. But since the virus causes milder illness in younger age groups, most would recover and subsequently be immune to the virus. This \u201cherd immunity\u201d would reduce transmission in the event of a winter resurgence. On Sky News , Vallance said that \u201cprobably about 60 percent\u201d of people would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity. Read: What will you do if you start coughing? Almost immediately, the supposed plan came under heavy criticism, coupled with confusion that public-health and science advisers would recommend this strategy. Herd immunity is typically generated through vaccination, and while it could arise through widespread infection, \u201cyou don\u2019t rely on the very deadly infectious agent to create an immune population,\u201d says Akiko Iwasaki , a virologist at the Yale School of Medicine. And that seemed like the goal. In interviews, Vallance and others certainly made it sound like the government was deliberately aiming for 60 percent of the populace to fall ill. Keep calm and carry on \u2026 and get COVID-19. That is not the plan. \u201cPeople have misinterpreted the phrase herd immunity as meaning that we\u2019re going to have an epidemic to get people infected,\u201d says Graham Medley at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Medley chairs a group of scientists who model the spread of infectious diseases and advise the government on pandemic responses. He says that the actual goal is the same as that of other countries: flatten the curve by staggering the onset of infections. As a consequence , the nation may achieve herd immunity; it\u2019s a side effect, not an aim. Indeed, yesterday, U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stated , \u201cHerd immunity is not our goal or policy.\u201d The government\u2019s actual coronavirus action plan , available online, doesn\u2019t mention herd immunity at all. \u201cThe messaging has been really confusing, and I think that was really unfortunate,\u201d says Petra Klepac, who is also an infectious-disease modeler at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s been a case of how not to communicate during an outbreak,\u201d says Devi Sridhar , a public-health specialist at the University of Edinburgh. Read: The dos and don\u2019ts of social distancing Since Thursday, news of stricter impending measures , such as a possible ban on mass gatherings , has been drip-fed to the media piecemeal. For example, yesterday, ITV News reported that the government will soon tell people over 70 to isolate themselves for four months, either at home or in care facilities, \u201cunder a wartime-style mobilization effort.\u201d But absent any details, critics were quick to point out flaws in the plan. \u201cWho do you think works at those nursing homes? Highly trained gibbons?\u201d asks Bill Hanage, a British infectious-disease epidemiologist based at Harvard University. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who are in that exact age group you are expecting to be infectious.\u201d The delay in calling for stronger measures is also perplexing. The government has thus far recommended that people with mild symptoms isolate themselves, even though people can clearly spread the virus before symptoms appear. That\u2019s why social distancing is so important. The government\u2019s own action plan even says that it will consider distancing measures \u201csuch as school closures, encouraging greater home working [and] reducing the number of large-scale gatherings.\u201d \u201cI think there will be a ramp-up of measures,\u201d Klepac says. \u201cVery soon, we\u2019ll be asking people to reduce their contacts.\u201d(Sure enough, in a press conference on Monday , Johnson said that it is time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others, and that the government will no longer be supporting mass gatherings.) Why didn\u2019t Johnson just roll out those measures on Thursday? Why wait, when cases are growing exponentially? Medley says the government is taking the long view. \u201cMy problem with many countries\u2019 strategies is that they haven\u2019t thought beyond the next month,\u201d he says. \u201cThe U.K. is different. We\u2019re at the beginning of a long process, and we\u2019re working out the best way to get there with the least public-health impact.\u201d To him, that means not rushing into panicked decisions about, say, banning soccer games or closing schools \u201cin a way that feels good but isn\u2019t necessarily evidence-based.\u201d Read: The strongest evidence yet that the U.S. is botching coronavirus testing But making a decent long-term strategy is hard when there are still two big unknowns that substantially affect how the pandemic will progress. First, we don\u2019t know how long immunity against the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, lasts. When people are infected with OC43 and HKU1\u2014two other coronaviruses that regularly circulate among humans and cause common colds\u2014they stay immune for less than a year. By contrast, immunity against the first SARS virus (from 2003) holds for much longer. No one knows whether SARS-CoV-2 will hew to either of these extremes, and according to one recent study , its behavior could mean anything from annual outbreaks to a decades-long quiet spell. We don\u2019t know how the virus will behave across the year either. Other human coronaviruses tend to peak in the winter, while lying low during the high humidity and temperatures of the summer. But it\u2019s unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 will do the same. One study showed that, across the globe, the biggest outbreaks have occurred within a narrow band of climate . But a more granular analysis across Chinese provinces showed that the virus can still easily spread in humid areas , and a third modeling study concluded that \u201cSARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year.\u201d The bottom line: There\u2019s a very wide range of possible futures. For that reason, critics of the U.K. strategy argue that swift, decisive action matters more than future hypotheticals do. The country\u2019s current caseload puts it only a few weeks behind Italy, where more than 24,000 cases have so overburdened hospitals that doctors must now make awful decisions about whom to treat. South Korea, by contrast, seems to have brought COVID-19 to heel through a combination of social-distancing measures and extensive testing. Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan have been similarly successful . \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to be doing. You go all in, or not at all. And not at all ends up like Italy,\u201d Hanage says. \u201cMaking plans for what you are going to be doing in six months when you have a catastrophe awaiting you in three weeks is just stupid.\u201d Read: How you should get food during a pandemic Even if the virus surges back once social restrictions are lifted or winter descends, \u201clet\u2019s buy time,\u201d Sridhar says. \u201cWe can use that time to get personal protective equipment in, to get beds ready, to get trainees trained properly. In the United States, there\u2019s a vaccine trial . There are trials of antivirals in China . We shouldn\u2019t give up hope.\u201d Much of this controversy stems from a lack of transparency: The models and data that have influenced the government\u2019s strategy haven\u2019t been published. And yes, these are trying and busy times, but throughout the pandemic, researchers have generally been quick to share their findings on preprint servers, allowing their peers to assess and check their work. \u201cIf your models are not ready for public scrutiny, they shouldn\u2019t be the basis of public policy,\u201d Sridhar says. She and her colleagues wrote a letter calling on the government to share the evidence behind its decisions. Two other letters have also been issued, one from the British Society for Immunology and another from more than 400 scientists . The models will reportedly be released within the coming days , although no firm time frame has been disclosed. In a similar letter, more than 500 behavioral scientists called on the government to disclose the evidence behind its contention that the public will experience \u201cbehavioral fatigue\u201d if restrictions are put in place too early. This concept reportedly comes from the Behavioural Insights Team , or \u201cNudge Unit\u201d\u2014a company that uses psychological science to advise the government on policy matters. But how reliable is that science? In the past decade, it has become clear that many psychology studies produce results that cannot be reproduced (the replication crisis), or that are irrelevant in all but a narrow set of circumstances ( the generalizability crisis ). Read: Deep clean, then clean again In their letter, more than 500 signatories wrote: We are not convinced that enough is known about \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances. Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it. In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. \u201cCarrying on as normal\u201d for as long as possible undercuts that urgency. Without strong guidance, British institutions and citizens have begun making their own decisions, going well over what the government recommends. Universities haven\u2019t been told to close, but many have , sending students home, moving classes and exams online, and postponing graduations. Many care homes will not be admitting visitors. Soccer leagues have been suspended. The Queen has canceled public engagements. The Scottish government is planning to close schools and expand testing . \u201cWhen you cannot rely on your government, there are still things that you can do,\u201d Hanage says. \u201cYou are able to limit your contacts, which will not only protect you but also your community. If you don\u2019t start to isolate yourself as much as you can, they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d \u201cWe really need people to engage and to sustain individual control measures, like social distancing, for months at a time,\u201d Klepac adds. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for the long term and we need everyone to do their part. It is a very big ask.\u201d","headline":"The U.K.\u2019s Coronavirus \u2018Herd Immunity\u2019 Debacle","article_name":608065.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2020\/03\/coronavirus-pandemic-herd-immunity-uk-boris-johnson\/608065\/","date_published":"2020-03-16 12:32:15","article_length":12294,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:38.398978","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2020\/03\/coronavirus-pandemic-herd-immunity-uk-boris-johnson\/608065\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Perceived as a moderate, he has embraced strikingly progressive goals without facing any political backlash. Almost halfway through Chris Wallace\u2019s July 19 interview with Donald Trump, an exchange occurred that encapsulates the current state of the presidential race. The president claimed that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, \u201cwants to defund the police.\u201d Wallace contradicted him, which led a furious Trump to instruct his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, to \u201cget me the charter\u201d of the unity task force that the Biden campaign had created with Bernie Sanders supporters. After riffling unsuccessfully through the document, Trump muttered, \u201cWe\u2019ll find it.\u201d But, as Wallace told viewers, \u201cThe White House never sent us evidence the Bernie-Biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police\u2014because there is none.\u201d On Fox News, Trump\u2019s home turf, the president looked like a fool. The incident illustrates one of the reasons that Biden has proved such an elusive target. Despite embracing an agenda that is further to the left than that of any Democratic nominee in decades, he\u2019s avoided the specific policy proposals and catchphrases that Republicans find easiest to attack. As a result, he appears more centrist than he actually is. In Biden, Democrats have a nominee who is promising FDR-style change, yet is avoiding the political backlash that an ambitious progressive agenda often brings. Shadi Hamid: The coronavirus killed the revolution Polls suggest that Americans are more comfortable with candidates close to the ideological center. In surveys this year, respondents consider Biden more moderate than Trump. That\u2019s a reversal from 2016, when Americans viewed Trump as more moderate than Hillary Clinton. One reason for this shift is that Trump\u2019s image has changed. By November 2016, after a campaign in which Trump had publicly opposed cutting Social Security and Medicare, slammed the Iraq War, and denounced America\u2019s campaign-finance system as corrupt, voters perceived him as less conservative than every other recent incoming Republican president except George H. W. Bush. But by early 2018, after a first year in office in which Trump promoted a hard-right economic and cultural agenda, his moderate reputation had already faded . It has never returned, which makes Biden look more moderate by contrast. Biden also appears more moderate than Clinton because, as I\u2019ve previously argued , Americans generally deem male candidates less threatening. In gauging a candidate\u2019s ideology, voters often seize on cultural cues. In his book Politics Lost , the journalist Joe Klein notes that in focus groups during the 1976 campaign, white voters insisted that Jimmy Carter opposed school busing even after being shown a speech in which he said he supported it. They claimed he was lying to win black votes. Carter overperformed among culturally conservative white voters because those voters couldn\u2019t imagine that a white male governor of Georgia was truly progressive on race. Biden benefits from stereotyping in a similar way. His race, gender, and age incline voters to view him as moderate. But race, gender, and age don\u2019t explain everything. Despite being old, white, and male, Bernie Sanders still convinced Democratic-primary voters that he was significantly further left than Elizabeth Warren. Adam Serwer: Trump is struggling to run against a white guy The other reason voters perceive Biden as moderate is that on issue after issue, he\u2019s adopted policies that are strikingly progressive while stopping just shy of the specific formulations that might leave him vulnerable to Republican attack. On criminal justice, for instance, Biden has proposed abolishing cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences, and creating a national roster of police officers who abuse their position\u2014all policies that place him to the left of the 2016 Democratic platform . But, to Trump\u2019s dismay, he hasn\u2019t proposed defunding the police. On education, Biden has proved more skeptical of both standardized testing and charter schools than the Obama administration. He\u2019s also called for tripling federal assistance to schools that educate poor kids, and for making college free for families earning less than $125,000\u2014pledges Clinton did not make four years ago. But he has refused to adopt Sanders\u2019s controversial call to make college free for everyone. On issue after issue, it\u2019s the same pattern. Biden now embraces a more generous public option than he did during the primaries, and wants to allow Americans to enroll in Medicare at age 60. But he doesn\u2019t support Medicare for All, which polls during the primary campaign found wasn\u2019t popular. He now calls for making all new buildings carbon neutral by 2030 and ending the use of fossil fuels for creating electricity by 2035. But he won\u2019t endorse a ban on fracking, which local Democrats have warned would hurt the party in Pennsylvania. And his unity task force on climate change, despite being co-chaired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, doesn\u2019t include the words Green New Deal . Franklin Foer: Biden has changed\u2014for the better On immigration, Biden wants to let in more refugees. And, unlike Barack Obama, he supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants without linking it to tougher border enforcement. But he doesn\u2019t support decriminalizing illegal border crossings or abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, two policies floated during the Democratic primary that don\u2019t  poll well . By repeatedly stopping short of the left\u2019s most ambitious\u2014and most politically incendiary\u2014proposals, Biden has created an agenda that is less progressive than Sanders\u2019s or Warren\u2019s would have been. (On foreign policy, the contrast between Biden and Sanders is even greater.) But as Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, told  Vox \u2019s Matthew Yglesias, Biden is still running on \u201cthe most progressive platform of any Democratic nominee in the modern history of the party.\u201d It\u2019s a shrewd strategy. Biden is allowing progressive activists to push him left\u2014just not so far left that he\u2019d be an easy mark for the GOP. No wonder Trump is sputtering with rage.","headline":"Biden Goes Big Without Sounding Like It","article_name":614878.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/joe-bidens-big-bold-and-very-quiet-agenda\/614878\/","date_published":"2020-08-03 10:15:00","article_length":6147,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:38.820838","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/joe-bidens-big-bold-and-very-quiet-agenda\/614878\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Warming oceans could be driving albatrosses to divorce unnecessarily. Albatrosses do not fall in love the way humans do. When the birds couple up, it\u2019s almost always for keeps. Their lives start lonely\u2014albatross parents lay only one egg at a time, and may leave their offspring unattended for days\u2014and at just a few months old, each juvenile embarks on an epic solo voyage at sea. They fly for months and months and months, learning what it is to be a bird. \u201cIt can be three years before you see them again,\u201d Francesco Ventura, a bird biologist at the University of Lisbon, told me. The adolescent albatrosses return to their colony single and ready to mingle. They touch down, find a group of like-minded individuals, and start to dance. At first, \u201cit\u2019s kind of like being at a club,\u201d Melinda Conners, a bird biologist at Stony Brook University, told me. The young hopefuls are seeking a partner that\u2019s both sexy and in sync with their own moves. Some species will sashay and shimmy and shriek; others are more muted, satisfied to simply bow and nod, and click and clack their beaks together. They are all fumbling at first, wee babes at the dating game\u2014exuberant, but \u201cdoing it all wrong,\u201d Conners said. The birds ultimately find their rhythm. Over the years, the mosh pits get smaller, the duets more intimate, until they each stop dancing with all partners but one. This is their perma-mate, their ride or die, their forever bae; once albatrosses unite, they almost never break up. Year after year, albatrosses fly out to sea alone. And year after year, they return to the same partner to breed, sometimes raising dozens of chicks together, until one of the duo dies at the end of a decades-long life. When Ventura and his colleagues visit black-browed-albatross populations in the South Atlantic Falklands, for instance, they regularly tabulate \u201cdivorce\u201d rates below 4 percent, sometimes near zero. That\u2019s true, at least, when times are good. But during certain years, the separations seem to intensify, leaving more birds than usual stranded in the doldrums of singlehood, unable to reproduce. Fluctuating environmental conditions\u2014likely a symptom of climate change\u2014may be the culprit. Read: Long live the albatross Ventura, who has been watching albatrosses for years, worries about heightened divorce rates, because the birds benefit so much by engaging in ritualized romance. Hatching and rearing chicks, even just one at a time, is difficult work; parents must take turns leaving the nest to forage for food, sometimes for weeks-long stints, while the other remains on the nest, fasting, guarding, waiting. \u201cThe whole breeding season is this carefully timed partnership,\u201d Nina Karnovsky, a bird biologist at Pomona College, told me. Enduring bonds translate into better communication, better coordination, even a sort of trust. The two birds entwine their behaviors so intimately that, somehow, after spending most of the year soaring solo above the ocean, they manage to return to the same nesting spot to breed, at almost exactly the same time. The birds will have extra-pair copulations\u2014that is, cheat\u2014but their modus operandi is monogamy. They know to cling to the relationship that counts. Under typical circumstances, only a handful of couples will ever truly call it quits. When albatross bonds do break, Ventura told me, it\u2019s almost always a strategy the birds use to \u201ccorrect for suboptimal partnerships\u201d that keep resulting in breeding failures\u2014eggs that never hatch, or chicks that never fledge. Finally fed up, one bird, usually the female, simply peaces out to find better prospects. If the original dalliance was a dud, many females will improve their reproductive success after they rewed. But while poring over data gathered during the past two decades, Ventura and his colleagues have started to notice a troubling trend . Some of the albatross couples on New Island, in the Falklands, seem to be divorcing unnecessarily, severing their ties even when everything about them seems to mesh. In many cases, Ventura told me, the birds are probably compatible, with many good years and healthy chicks ahead of them. \u201cThey should have stayed together,\u201d he told me, and yet, something in the birds\u2019 surroundings is cleaving them apart. Albatrosses do not divorce the way humans do. When the birds head for splitsville, they don\u2019t hire lawyers, and no alimony changes hands. Sometimes they squabble; sometimes the break is quite clean. \u201cWe still don\u2019t fully understand why divorce happens in birds,\u201d Antica Culina, a behavioral biologist at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, told me. But the repercussions can reverberate throughout populations, perhaps even species, if the events are frequent enough. \u201cDivorce means they are starting over,\u201d Karnovsky told me. \u201cThey have to go through the whole courtship again, the whole energetically expensive display.\u201d For albatrosses, whose couplings can take years to solidify, that can mean stripping away multiple opportunities to reproduce\u2014a real waste, if nothing was wrong with their initial choice. According to Ventura\u2019s research, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening on New Island in years when food grows scarce. In 2017, for example, albatross divorce rates more than doubled from the average of 3.7 percent, up to 7.7 percent. That year, the local sea surface was unusually hot, which generally spells trouble for food availability\u2014toasty top layers of water just don\u2019t mix as well with the nutrient-rich ones below. The link between ocean temperatures and divorces has become clear since the mid-aughts, when Ventura\u2019s team first started tracking the birds\u2019 matrimonial success: \u201cIn resource-poor years, everybody struggles,\u201d Ventura told me. Some of the splits can likely be traced back to breeding problems, the best-studied trigger of divorce. A few birds might forage so poorly, for instance, that they actually can\u2019t produce viable offspring, or they simply prioritize their own survival over sex. But Culina notes that Ventura\u2019s study, which she wasn\u2019t involved in, shows that problems in the environment can drive divorce in more subtle ways too. Crummy environmental conditions can make it tough for even the strongest, fastest, sexiest birds to chum up with their mate. They might struggle to sync their schedules; they might each have a much shorter fuse. Even females that have been very reproductively successful seem more likely to divorce a partner during these bad stretches. Ventura describes it as a sort of misguided \u201cpartner blaming,\u201d wherein the birds confuse bad conditions for bad mates. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to think about,\u201d said Conners, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cSome of these pairs have potentially been raising chicks for decades \u2026 and they\u2019re being broken up by things that were entirely out of their hands.\u201d Researchers rarely see the moment of divorce in real time, though even imagining it is bleak. Karnovsky has seen a version of the split in Ad\u00e9lie penguins, which also take alternating shifts on their nest. Left alone too long, birds will grow hungry and impatient; they fidget and call out, as if worried they\u2019ve been abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m so hungry, I have to go,\u2019\u201d she told me. Eventually, the birds jump ship, leaving their partnership broken, their eggs unguarded. On New Island, where some 15,500 black-browed-albatross breeding pairs make their home, the population is thriving; Ventura and his colleagues aren\u2019t yet seeing divorce wreak havoc, even in pretty rough years. But they fear that resilience won\u2019t hold for all populations, especially as the years wear on. Albatrosses around the world have long been threatened, by plastic pollution that chokes them, by long-line fishing vessels that snare the birds on hooks and drown them, by invasive rodents that attack their nests. Warming seas are \u201cyet another human-caused impact\u201d that the birds don\u2019t need, Karnovsky said. As climate change accelerates, these home-wrecking effects could be magnified. \u201cI don\u2019t think the birds will have time to adapt,\u201d Stephanie Jenouvrier, a seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has been independently tracking the impacts of ocean anomalies on birds, told me. Read: Scientists now know why some seabirds eat so much plastic What may eventually be lost to climate change goes far beyond a potential dip in avian numbers. For the birds, breakups come with a personal cost: the vanishing of one of the most compelling emotional bonds in the animal kingdom. Albatrosses in matrimonial sync will tenderly preen each other and cuddle in their nest. They will nuzzle their heads together, and doze breast to breast. \u201cThey just kind of dote on each other,\u201d Conners told me. \u201cYou see them absolutely celebrating when a mate returns\u201d from a trip at sea, hopping up and vocalizing. The ties that bind them are strong. But they might not be strong enough to withstand the changes wrought by an ever-warming world.","headline":"It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s Climate Change","article_name":620795.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/albatross-divorce-climate-change\/620795\/","date_published":"2021-11-24 00:00:00","article_length":8951,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:39.691999","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/11\/albatross-divorce-climate-change\/620795\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"By portraying the early years of climate politics as a tragedy, the magazine lets Republicans and the fossil-fuel industry off the hook. The New York Times Magazine has tried to make the release of its new article , which details a decade of climate history, as momentous as possible. It has devoted the entire new issue of the magazine to just this one story, which is written by Nathaniel Rich. It has even produced a video trailer for it. Having read the story, I am left to wonder: What was the point? The article tells the tale of three men who, between 1979 and 1989, helped turn climate change into a major political issue. At the beginning of this period, few Washington officials knew much of anything about global warming. By the end, President George H.W. Bush was close to signing a United Nations treaty to address it. Rich writes with gripping, novelistic detail, and he captures the comedy and frustration of scientists struggling to shape the political sphere. The story is bookended by a prodigious amount of material. There\u2019s an editor\u2019s note, tinged with echoes of The Twilight Zone : \u201cThe second part, covering the period from 1983 to 1989 \u2026 is the part readers will be likely to find most frustrating.\u201d And there\u2019s a prologue and an epilogue, in which Rich makes sense of his own effort. He sees this sweep of time\u2014this first decade in which climate change was understood to be political\u2014as tragic in the Aristotelian sense. Some small group of men glimpsed humanity\u2019s tragic flaw\u2014but, woe unto us, they could not convince an intransigent and ignorant public before it was too late: In the decade that ran from 1979 to 1989, we had an excellent opportunity to solve the climate crisis. The world\u2019s major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding, global framework to reduce carbon emissions\u2014far closer than we\u2019ve come since. During those years, the conditions for success could not have been more favorable. The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way \u2014 nothing except ourselves. Ah, yes, ourselves. Now settle in, parishioners, for you know what\u2019s coming next. This is a story about humanity, about the frailty and hubris of those tool-wielding primates who realized they could burn old rocks for energy and, in doing so, accidentally cooked the Earth. It is not a risible idea: Perhaps (as Rich later speculates) climate change really is impossible for our mammalian minds to comprehend, its timescales too grand for our two- and four-year election cycles. But in order to turn a story about the U.S. politics of climate change into a story about the entirety of the human species, Rich has to make a strange argument. He has to dispatch with the two most powerful and prominent enemies of a climate policy in the United States: the fossil-fuel industry and the Republican Party. He does so, quickly, in the prologue. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we act? A common boogeyman today is the fossil-fuel industry,\u201d he writes. But this can\u2019t be the case: These companies did not actually oppose climate policy in the 1980s. \u201cThe coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989,\u201d he claims, adding that Exxon and Shell even made \u201cgood-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis.\u201d \u201cNor can the Republican Party be blamed,\u201d he writes, before naming a smattering of Republicans who endorsed some kind of climate policy at some point during the 1980s. The list includes three senators (one from Rhode Island), an EPA administrator, and President George H.W. Bush \u201cduring his presidential campaign.\u201d \u201cThe issue was unimpeachable, like support for veterans or small business,\u201d Rich writes. \u201cExcept the climate had an even broader constituency, composed of every human being on Earth.\u201d By the end of this spiel, it\u2019s not hard to see the \u201979-to-\u201989 decade as a halcyon period for climate politics. For liberals especially, it amounts to a reassuring image: All those reasonable, bipartisan arguments for climate action really were seen as reasonable and bipartisan once. Is that\u2026 remotely true? Rich\u2019s own reporting suggests that it is not. Again and again, he describes the Reagan administration going out of its way to thwart climate science and policy. In President Reagan\u2019s first year, the White House defunded solar-energy research , considered closing the Energy Department, and expanded coal-mining on federal lands. When an executive agency warned that burning fossil fuels could \u201cpermanently and disastrously\u201d warm the atmosphere, the White House tried unsuccessfully to shutter that agency, too. In 1982, after its bid to close the Energy Department failed, the White House specifically tried to defund the department\u2019s carbon-dioxide research program. Every single one of these facts appears in Rich\u2019s piece. Nor was President Reagan\u2019s successor blameless. Today, George H.W. Bush is remembered as an unusually eco-friendly Republican: He expanded the scope of the Clean Air Act and signed an important early UN treaty on climate change . He also talked about climate change on the campaign trail. \u201cThose who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect,\u201d he told supporters in 1988. But this interest was shallow. In 1989, Bush\u2019s White House tried to censor the scientific conclusions of NASA and NOAA climate scientists. And Rich reports that Bush, for all his can-do rhetoric, never took \u201ca vigorous interest in global warming and was mainly briefed about it by nonscientists.\u201d This negligence allowed John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, to control the administration\u2019s climate policy. Sununu is the closest thing that Rich\u2019s story has to a villain: It\u2019s implied that he prevented William K. Reilly, Bush\u2019s EPA administrator, from negotiating a UN treaty that meaningfully limited greenhouse-gas emissions. Today, Sununu is a notorious doubter of mainstream climate science. The thrust of this history suggests that powerful figures in the Republican Party were already skeptical of human-caused climate change by 1980. These leaders had not yet converted most Republican rank-and-file voters to their view, and indeed there may have been a few supporters of climate action in the party. But by and large, the most influential administration officials muddied climate science and weakened climate policy. If Rich seems a little too charitable to the G.O.P, he lets fossil-fuel interests off the hook entirely. It\u2019s likely that oil executives knew humans were triggering climate change before Rich\u2019s story even picks up. As early as 1977, Exxon executives had been briefed that \u201cmankind is influencing the global climate,\u201d according to a Pulitzer-nominated investigation from Inside Climate News . In 1982, Exxon scientists confirmed mainstream climate theory with their in-house models. Then, in 1983 , Exxon cut its budget for climate research from $900,000 to $150,000. By the end of the decade, Exxon had essentially eliminated the research program. Some historians and researchers of the fossil-fuel industry have scratched their head at this element of Rich\u2019s piece. \u201cFor the record, the American Petroleum Institute publicly downplayed the dangers of global warming as early as 1980,\u201d said Ben Franta , a researcher at Stanford, in a statement. * And Robert Brulle , a sociologist at Drexel University who studies environmental policy, noted that Rich\u2019s story did not mention that \u201cclimate-science denial efforts\u201d began in 1982, with the publication of Sherwood Idso\u2019s Carbon Dioxide, Friend or Foe. Republicans are surely not alone to blame for our country\u2019s lack of a climate policy. But consider that almost four decades have elapsed since the 1980 presidential election, when Rich roughly begins his tale. Democrats have controlled Congress and the White House for four of those years. During the first of those windows, the Clinton administration proposed a tax on fossil fuels\u2014 which passed the House but not the Senate . During the second, the Obama administration proposed a more market-based tax on fossil fuels. It also passed the House but not the Senate . Republicans, meanwhile, have controlled the two branches for about six and a half years. And not only have they not moved forward with climate legislation, they have resisted every major effort to stanch the bleeding, whether in power or out. It was a Republican president who, in 2001 , declined to implement the Kyoto Protocol, a binding global treaty to reduce carbon pollution. It was a Republican-led EPA that, in 2006 , argued the Clean Air Act could not regulate greenhouse gases. It was a Republican administration that, in 2007 , insisted that all future climate treaties remain nonbinding and unenforceable. And it is a Republican president who, in 2017 , abandoned the Paris Agreement, the nonbinding and unenforceable climate treaty that emerged from that old demand. Could we really have solved climate change in 1989? I\u2019m not sure. There are too many counterfactuals to consider: Would solar and wind technology have improved in time? Could the United States have rejiggered its economy in the absence of a popular movement calling for it? Could climate mitigation have avoided the hyper-polarization that defines every other partisan issue, like abortion and guns? Rich\u2019s piece makes for vivid history. It alludes to plenty of real changes: the fracturing of a unified political elite, the breakdown of the alliance between high science and the national-security state. But it\u2019s tempting, when revisiting the past, to assume that everything was better then . The history of just about every major American political issue is contested; it\u2019s not surprising that climate change should be the same. But any sensible narrative of climate politics has to start and finish with the idea that opposition to climate policy grew in parallel with the scientific case for action. Telling the wrong story makes the case for action look easier than it is. * This article originally misstated Ben Franta\u2019s position at Stanford.","headline":"The Problem With The New York Times' Big Story on Climate Change","article_name":566525.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/nyt-mag-nathaniel-rich-climate-change\/566525\/","date_published":"2018-08-01 14:42:02","article_length":10106,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:40.152339","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/nyt-mag-nathaniel-rich-climate-change\/566525\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"When Avery McRae decided to take on the government\u2019s environmental policies, she had no idea who she\u2019d be up against. It was supposed to be Avery McRae\u2019s first day back at school after winter break, but fat snowflakes were falling outside and class was canceled. Her horseback-riding lesson wasn\u2019t happening either. At lunch with her mom and dad at Hot Mama\u2019s Wings, in Eugene, Oregon, Avery slumped in her seat and stuck out her lip, disappointed the way 11-year-olds are when they\u2019ve been waiting for something forever . \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the horses in three weeks,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d Avery had been in Denver for the holiday visiting family, but now she was back home, eager to return to sixth grade and afternoons stacked with extracurricular activities. She plays piano and has practiced Bhangra, a Punjabi folk dance, since she was two. Each morning, she feeds chickens she\u2019s named after flowers, and each evening, she makes sure they\u2019re tucked in their coop. In the spring, she runs a backyard business raising chicks for customers. And, sometimes, she goes to court. Unlike most tweens, Avery is suing the federal government. She\u2019s the second-youngest of 21 plaintiffs , ages 9 to 20, in Juliana v. United States , a case filed in Eugene in 2015 on the grounds that the federal government has knowingly endangered them by promoting the burning of fossil fuels. If climate change threatens their future, they reason, the government has violated their constitutional right to due process. There are roughly the same number of defendants as plaintiffs in the case, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of the President and the president himself. Until January 20, that was Barack Obama. Now it\u2019s Donald Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re suing Trump!\u201d Avery recalls her classmates said when they flocked her at school on November 9. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yep.\u2019 What did I get myself into?\u201d * * * When Avery and I spoke on the phone for the first time, about six months before the election, I asked her why people should care about the lawsuit. She became breathless as she described the stakes. In short, she said, the case will decide how future generations will survive on earth: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to have to wear air masks every time they go outside or if they\u2019re going to live in pristine environments where they can swim in cold water in the summer and fish and hike in old-growth forests and not worry about climate change.\u201d Avery started caring about the environment around the age of 5, when she read a book about snow leopards. Finding out they were endangered made her \u201csuper heartbroken.\u201d Her mom suggested they raise money for the animals, so one day in December, Avery threw a party with a small suggested donation. She and some friends made leopard Christmas ornaments and decorated cupcakes with spots. By the end, she had raised $200 that she donated to the Snow Leopard Trust. The following year, Avery and friends made more ornaments and raised money for wolves and, more recently, for salmon. Avery had seen some spawning in nearby Whittaker Creek and marveled over how they were swimming the same water as the previous generation of the fish had done, and the next generation would. It was a blow when her parents told her on the drive home that some salmon, too, are endangered. It wasn\u2019t long after that she became involved with Our Children\u2019s Trust, the legal heft behind the lawsuit that works on climate cases with young people, lawyers, and scientists around the world. The organization is based in Eugene, Avery\u2019s hometown. When she signed up for a summer camp the group organized one year, she spent a week learning how to testify at city council meetings, painting a mural on the building of a bicycle shop downtown, and screen-printing shirts with polar bears. Avery was especially inspired by Kelsey Cascadia Rose Juliana, who volunteered with the camp before becoming the lawsuit\u2019s namesake. \u201cShe\u2019s insane,\u201d Avery says\u2014a compliment. Our Children\u2019s Trust was clearly impressed by Avery, too. The group asked her to join the lawsuit, and after considering the commitment\u2014years\u2014she was onboard. In a photo taken on the federal courthouse steps after the first hearing of oral arguments in March, Avery and the other plaintiffs are standing in front of a sign that says \u201cOur future is a constitutional right.\u201d Avery, who still isn\u2019t tall enough to sit in the front seat of her parents\u2019 car, looks tiny next to Julia Olson, one of the lawyers representing the group, in the first row. * * * Avery\u2019s mom, Holly McRae, admits Eugene can be a bubble. The city is surrounded by natural wonder: Whittaker Creek, where Avery watched salmon chug upstream, is less than an hour from the McRae\u2019s house; Willamette National Forest and the Oregon coast are both less than two hours away. In Eugene, the McRaes have found a community of likeminded people who care deeply about the environment and social justice. Holly works as an events coordinator for the McKenzie River Trust, and Our Children\u2019s Trust recently hired Avery\u2019s dad, Matt, as a climate-policy strategist. Before that, Matt worked for the city as a climate and energy analyst. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by local activists working on so many things. It gives me hope,\u201d Holly says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also easy to kind of lose sight of the fact that we are not necessarily the entire country.\u201d In November, more than 1.5 times as many residents in Lane County, where Eugene is the seat, voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump, according to the local paper . When Trump supporters flocked to a Eugene fairground for a rally in May, it felt like a different town to the McRaes. Avery recalled \u201clots of confederate flags.\u201d There were really only a couple, Holly told me later, but that\u2019s still more than Avery had seen before. Immediately after Trump took office, all mentions of climate change were purged from the White House website except for a promise to kill Obama\u2019s policies. EPA staff were temporarily instructed not to issue press releases or post on social media without prior approval. Even before the inauguration, Trump\u2019s transition team unsettled many at the Department of Energy by requesting the names of employees who had worked on climate change within the agency. \u201cHe\u2019s put his cards on the table,\u201d Olson, the lawyer, says. \u201cHe wants to renew development of coal in the United States. He wants to open up and authorize every pipeline he can for oil and gas development. He\u2019s pushing heavily towards increasing our fossil fuel-based energy system.\u201d Avery was 3 years old when Obama was first elected, so Trump\u2019s charge into office was the first presidential transition she has ever really been attuned to. Up to this point, she has only known a president who was actively concerned about climate change, even if she and the other plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States believed his administration didn\u2019t do enough to prevent it. Now, it seems she\u2019s up against something else entirely. * * * In some ways, the new administration\u2019s stance on climate change actually could work to the lawsuit\u2019s advantage, Olson contends. If Trump and his team deny that global warming is happening and continue to contribute to \u201cthe destabilization of our climate,\u201d Our Children\u2019s Trust\u2019s case will be stronger, she says. And she thinks that unlike during the Obama administration, policies that hurt the environment will be more transparent under Trump. (Trump did not respond to questions about the lawsuit. The Department of Justice also did not respond to a request for comment about the case.) The suit has already cleared a couple legal hurdles . Last April, the U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied a motion to dismiss the case, and then in November, the U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken affirmed that ruling, and paved the way for the case to proceed to trial. On Tuesday, Coffin instructed the parties to prioritize expert discovery on the scientific components of the case, and scheduled another meeting for March 8, according to Our Children\u2019s Trust. The plaintiffs want the trial to start in the fall, but according to the organization, the federal government has indicated it\u2019s considering appealing the earlier rulings that denied motions to dismiss. Aiken\u2019s decision that there might be a constitutional right to a sound environment is the first ever from a federal court, notes Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. But even if the plaintiffs prevail, Gerrard doesn\u2019t think the decision would survive a Supreme Court review\u2014especially with one or two justices tapped by Trump. The justices have shown reluctance to legislate in lieu of Congress on environmental issues in the past, and they don\u2019t often declare new rights, he says. In American Electric Power Co. v Connecticut , several states asked the federal court to require electric utility companies to reduce emissions for coal-fired power plants. The court found that Congress gave EPA the job of setting the appropriate level of air pollution and so it wasn\u2019t for the courts to decide. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a similar feeling expressed here,\u201d Gerrard says. At one court hearing last year, Avery says she listened to arguments that she and the other plaintiffs didn\u2019t have a constitutional right to public lands, or a clean atmosphere. It was \u201csuper, super maddening,\u201d she says. But when her mom pulled her out of class in April and told her that the case was moving forward, Avery started screaming at the top of her lungs. When she told her classmates what had happened, they started screaming, too. * * * At Hot Mama\u2019s Wings, the waitress knew Holly wanted chicken tenders before she could order. Avery has lived in the same home since she was born, and her room reflects a short lifetime of collecting treasures\u2014rocks, fossils, and horse figurines on display with a warning to please not touch. An entire wall is covered with posters of horses and a few donkeys (she calls \u201cequines\u201d her favorite animal so she doesn\u2019t leave them out). Another poster, of a snow leopard, is a reminder of her early entr\u00e9e into environmentalism. As Avery fights to protect her future, Matt and Holly have tried to ensure that she savors her childhood as well. They shield her from comments on stories about the suit so that she doesn\u2019t absorb the online vitriol: A third of the plaintiffs are minorities, and Holly says she regularly sees derogatory racial posts about the case on social media. Since the inauguration, they\u2019ve tried to keep the radio off more often, too. Avery was in court on Tuesday and she expects she\u2019ll appear there again this year. In the meantime, she\u2019s following the case and anticipating the depositions of heavy-hitters like Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil CEO and new secretary of state. But she\u2019s also practicing songs on guitar and is in the middle of new fantasy series that\u2019s piled by her bedside. She\u2019s working on the classic Peanuts song \u201cLinus and Lucy\u201d on the piano. The lawsuit is important, sure, but it doesn\u2019t monopolize her time. She\u2019d rank it third among the activities that occupy her days, after school and dance. She knows she could be in high school by the time it\u2019s resolved. By then, she can sit shotgun.","headline":"The 11-Year-Old Suing Trump Over Climate Change","article_name":516054.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/trump-climate-lawsuit\/516054\/","date_published":"2017-02-09 09:45:00","article_length":11265,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:40.164519","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/trump-climate-lawsuit\/516054\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new anthology about climate change acknowledges that we are both willing participants in and at the mercy of the systems that are destroying us. Greek mythology can be helpful when trying to make sense of the climate crisis. The imminent threat of total ecological collapse carries a certain mythological air, with its sweeping scale and embedded warnings against hubris. Hubris, after all, landed us here\u2014that mortal weakness that brings individuals to ruin and topples empires, that fixes in us the delusion that power, once obtained, is permanent. That no man or god or gale-force wind can snatch it away. There are several allusions to myth\u2014Greek and otherwise\u2014in The World as We Knew It: Dispatches From a Changing Climate , a new anthology co-edited by Amy Brady and Tajja Isen. One of the most striking is in the science journalist Meera Subramanian\u2019s essay, \u201cLeap.\u201d In it, she retells the story of the giant Antaeus, who channeled the power of his parents\u2014Poseidon, god of the sea, and Gaia, goddess of the earth\u2014to challenge unsuspecting passersby to wrestling matches, believing he could never lose. It isn\u2019t until Heracles comes along that he is finally defeated. Antaeus\u2019s strength came from contact with the earth; sever him from it, Heracles realized, and his power would dissolve. Heracles lifted Antaeus off the ground, and \u201cthe giant\u2019s strength drained out of his suspended body like an ice cube melting in the sun.\u201d In the end, Antaeus dies pitifully. Read: Nature writing that sees possibility in climate change The Antaeus myth is one of many that eerily parallel our current predicament. Our power also comes from the Earth\u2014in the form of fossil fuels , the global food supply , breathable air, potable water\u2014and we, too, can be severed from it. But Subramanian interprets the myth as an actionable lesson. Antaeus \u201ctouched the earth to redouble his strength and then wasted it accosting strangers,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe could draw on the same earth force, but instead of using it to fight each other, use it to refill our pens and recharge our minds and repower our worlds with energy spun from light and wind.\u201d Summoning the possibility, as Subramanian does, of a tangible solution to the climate crisis\u2014one that springs forth from the same humans who created it\u2014is perhaps unduly optimistic. But it speaks to the contradictory nature of climate anxiety. To write about the connection humans have to the changing climate, one must nurse two competing anxieties at once: We are both willing participants in and at the mercy of the systems that are destroying us. As the authors of this collection share personal stories about global collapse, a tricky question materializes. How do we think about the idea of individual responsibility when its relationship to climate change is so slippery? Read: The dark side of the houseplant boom In \u201cFrom This Valley, They Say, You Are Leaving,\u201d the novelist Lydia Millet, like Subramanian, writes about the deaths of great giants\u2014in her case, the saguaros of the Sonoran Desert, where Millet has lived for much of her adult life. These huge, anthropomorphic cacti, which have come to symbolize the American Southwest, are vulnerable to changes in rainfall and rising temperatures. Their deaths\u2014which Millet captures with the same measured pathos found in her novels\u2014are especially tragic, given how long one takes to mature, and how few are growing as the desert climate becomes harsher. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several giants die on my land,\u201d she writes, \u201camong them one with dozens of arms that was likely a couple of centuries old.\u201d Alongside these observations, however, Millet must also consider the ways in which her presence there leaves its own mark. Her \u201ccontentment and career\u201d depend on carbon-heavy travel, and though she describes her efforts to keep mostly native foliage on her property and to install sustainable energy solutions in her home, she also describes her lifestyle as a \u201cgift of fossil fuels.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a conservationist who worries about carbon all the time,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut can\u2019t live in her private haven without leaving a heavy footprint.\u201d Other writers in The World as We Knew It find themselves caught in this same tension between vulnerability and culpability, passivity and action. In \u201cIowa Bestiary,\u201d the writer Melissa Febos explores her relationship to the wildlife of Iowa, where she relocated during the pandemic\u2014a move that prompts her to reflect on the comforts afforded to her by her citizenship in a greedy, imperialist nation. In \u201cA Brief History of Breathing,\u201d the novelist Pitchaya Sudbanthad tells us that his aunt carries an air-quality detector to measure the sometimes dangerously high number of airborne particulates as she makes her way around Bangkok. \u201cI often confront my own complicity,\u201d he then writes, \u201cas I am fed into the slow, perpetual circulation of Bangkok traffic.\u201d Read: As the climate changes, so does fiction Even in essays that skew strongly toward despair, powerlessness never fully eliminates personal responsibility. In \u201cMobbing Call,\u201d the novelist Tracy O\u2019Neill grapples with her feelings about not having children. \u201cI would have brought into being a consciousness who would experience terror for which I could offer no consolation,\u201d she writes, imagining the compounding effects of global warming in the decades to come\u2014more disease, more flooding, more heat. Shortly after, she cites another reason to not reproduce: a famous Lund University study , which found that childbearing left a significantly larger carbon footprint than, say, owning a car or eating a meat-rich diet . These two arguments against childbearing\u2014hypothetical fear and actual responsibility\u2014reveal that same contradictory anxiety. Though we are victims of the forces of climate change, we must also make sacrifices to stop them. Near the end of her essay, Subramanian writes, \u201cWe have returned to the times of mythology, and we need new stories to survive.\u201d The World as We Knew It is an attempt to write these stories, to hold a mirror up to our lives at a crucial moment in our collective history, and reflect the slew of compounding, often conflicting fears that characterize it. In many ways, storytelling while on the precipice of global devastation is no different from storytelling at any moment in our history. Delve into ancient myths and you\u2019ll quickly realize that the human condition has always been marked by an uneasy awareness that even the most rigid systems are subject to the whims of fate. What might distinguish our time is the compendium of frightening evidence that shows us what those systems are and how long they might have left. Infrastructure is collapsing faster than we can repair it; shifting climates are becoming less hospitable to us and more hospitable to disease-carrying insects; food security is at risk. \u201cIn this unfolding context, small things take on terrifying and uncertain correlations,\u201d writes the novelist Delia Falconer in \u201cSigns and Wonders,\u201d in which she deftly compares modern climate scientists to the Roman augurs, who once watched the behaviors and movements of animals and read into them portents of doom. \u201cIt\u2019s as if \u2026 in trying to see into the future we\u2019re returning to the dread speculation of the past.\u201d Falconer\u2019s point is that, even with all of this evidence, our era is filled with uncertainty. It\u2019s this uncertainty that makes our fears feel impossible to act on, that keeps us locked in contradictions and diffuse worry. Very occasionally, in the anthology, those anxieties are replaced by something else\u2014a sense of peace and beauty that springs forth not despite the horrors of our world but because of them. \u201cIf I\u2019m on an elevated highway near sunset,\u201d says Sudbanthad, speaking of the same Bangkok traffic that fills him with such guilt, \u201cI can marvel at the orange-hued haze that makes the city look like a shimmering mirage in the desert.\u201d These are the moments when stories transform from fragile mirrors into shields. When our power and powerlessness can coexist without us feeling the paralyzing weight of their illogic. When living on a dying planet seems possible.","headline":"\u2018I\u2019ve Seen Several Giants Die on My Land\u2019","article_name":661356.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/books\/archive\/2022\/06\/the-world-as-we-knew-it-climate-anthology-review\/661356\/","date_published":"2022-06-23 11:00:00","article_length":8126,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:41.044804","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/books\/archive\/2022\/06\/the-world-as-we-knew-it-climate-anthology-review\/661356\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Among all possible climate actions, recycling ranks pretty low in its impact. One of the few things Americans largely agree on is recycling. This simple act is popular with Democrats, Republicans, free-market diehards, and environmental advocates alike, data consistently show. And among recycling enthusiasts, one group is particularly keen\u2014people already concerned about climate change. This makes a certain intuitive sense, as recycling has well-documented benefits for the planet and can reduce carbon emissions. Still, as climate actions go, even the most committed recyclers caution that this one has clear limits. \u201cThere are a lot of climate benefits to bolstering the recycling system,\u201d Beth Porter, the author of Reduce, Reuse, Reimagine: Sorting Out the Recycling System , told me. \u201cBut we also have to acknowledge that recycling is not among the highest-priority actions.\u201d Recycling does have value. It is one of the easier climate-friendly acts individuals can undertake, and it reduces the extraction of virgin materials. \u201cAny time you use renewable resources, or secondary resources, there\u2019s less carbon emitted than if you use primary resources,\u201d Adam Minter, the author of Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade , an insider\u2019s account of the international recycling business, told me. Read: Is this the end of recycling? Despite the carbon involved in collection, transport, and processing, recycled aluminum, for example, is about 95 percent less energy-intensive to forge than its raw alternative. Project Drawdown, a nonprofit group that conducts reviews of climate solutions, includes recycling in its recommendations for reining in emissions. But when the group analyzed more than 80 separate means that could help keep the world from passing the oft-cited threshold of 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the recycling industry \u2019s projected contributions fell below the median, trailing geothermal power, efficient aviation, forest protection, and dozens of other actions. Project Drawdown\u2019s list centers on strategies that are feasible to adopt and have room for growth within the existing market. It gives more weight to solutions such as onshore wind turbines for that reason. The recommendations also account for recycling\u2019s tricky relationship with waste reduction\u2014on its face, waste reduction alone saves much more in emissions. If 1 million metric tons of waste are landfilled, direct emissions equal about 274,000 tons of CO 2 -equivalent, Miranda Gorman, a senior fellow with the group, explained to me. Not sending items for disposal avoids creating those emissions. Recycling is more complex, because the process itself consumes energy and resources. But it still reduces the use of virgin feedstocks, which Project Drawdown estimates can save up to an additional 2 million tons of CO 2 -equivalent. Both are ultimately needed, the group says. \u201cWe analyze the impact of the integrated system as a whole, and all of the solutions are interconnected,\u201d Gorman said. Read: The dangerous pile-up of artificial turf For recycling to truly make an impact, however, it needs to be more effective. In 2018, national rates had dipped to 32 percent of total municipal waste, according to the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014out of almost 300 million tons of waste generated that year, only 69 million tons were recycled. Paper and paperboard are among the more recycled materials, while glass has stagnated at about 25 percent. Plastics recycling rates remain under 10 percent. Americans might want to recycle, but a constant influx of new and hard-to-manage materials in the waste stream poses ongoing problems for facilities with aging infrastructure. This can be compounded by a lack of education and standardization: Recycling programs differ wildly, and people are often so enthusiastic about recycling, they toss items into a bin without verifying that they can, in fact, be recycled. That last problem is sometimes called \u201cwish-cycling.\u201d If a municipal program receives a particular item that it cannot accept, it is subsequently hauled elsewhere for disposal, creating emissions and contributing to the waste stream. Such practices, Minter noted, underscore the gap between the public\u2019s good intentions and recycling\u2019s real capacity. \u201cPeople just really want a way out of their consumption that doesn\u2019t make them feel bad,\u201d he said. But recycling does ultimately play a role in emissions reduction, and in recent years the industry, too, has leaned into its clear climate benefits. \u201cLandfills create methane, a serious climate bad actor, and the less that goes into the landfill, the better,\u201d Keefe Harrison, the CEO of The Recycling Partnership (TRP), told me. \u201cFrom a system point of view, recycling protects the climate by keeping natural habitats in place, limiting the need for carbon-intensive harvesting of virgin natural resources.\u201d Read: A new way of thinking about climate change A national nonprofit, TRP focuses on building public-private partnerships to boost recycling, powered by a group of funders, including Coca-Cola, the American Chemistry Council, and Burt\u2019s Bees. Like others in the space, TRP\u2019s message often centers on \u201ccircularity\u201d and the idea of an economy that operates in a renewing cycle rather than on a linear path that culminates in disposal. Climate change is a key part of that message. Since its beginning in 2014, Harrison said, TRP's work has helped prevent the emission of about 251,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, in addition to diverting more than 230 million tons of recyclables from landfills. And the group thinks that more emissions reductions are possible: In a 2020 report , TRP found that only about half of Americans have access to curbside pickup, and that many who do have access don\u2019t fully participate. That has led to the inverse of wish-cycling\u2014items are being thrown away that could be recycled. Curbside recycling currently recovers only about 32 percent of what is available in single-family homes, according to TRP. If the remainder were recycled each year, based on calculations through the EPA\u2019s Waste Reduction Model , which determines emissions savings stemming from waste-management practices, TRP has found that \"would also reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 96 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent,\" Harrison said. Although industry forces see recycling as a key climate tool, others are more skeptical, including Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and founder of the Last Beach Cleanup. The chief focus of her criticism is a common one: plastics. \u201cCompanies actively use recycling as a distraction and an excuse,\u201d Dell told me. She sees many corporate recycling pledges as a means of evading actual climate action. Environmental advocates maintain that plastics are largely single-use: A 2020 Greenpeace USA survey found that plastics with resin codes #3\u20137 are virtually impossible to recycle, because of limited facility processing capabilities and insufficient market demand. Lawsuits are currently ongoing against Walmart and Keurig Green Mountain , arguing that those companies have violated Federal Trade Commission guidance by presenting plastic items as recyclable. The corporate giants have defended themselves against the allegations and emphasized their commitment to sustainability. (Walmart said in a statement that the company is \u201ca strong advocate for the environment\u201d and recycling, while Keurig has maintained in court that its labels advise consumers to \u201ccheck locally\u201d regarding recycling options.) Other industry groups and corporations have also strongly disputed Greenpeace\u2019s report and broader thesis. Some are members of the U.S. Plastics Pact , a large-scale voluntary effort driven by TRP and other groups that aims to achieve 100 percent reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, among several other goals. Their focus is creating a market for plastics that keeps them in circulation, rather than dooming them to disposal. Critics say focusing on getting hard-to-recycle materials out of the recycling system altogether would do more to curb climate and environmental issues. Dell suggested going back to \u201ccore four\u201d recyclables (cardboard, plastic bottles, glass bottles, and aluminum cans), since items such as plastic film and bags are notorious for burdening recycling facilities. But she also cited the Jevons paradox, the economic idea that increasing the efficiency of a resource\u2019s use also increases its consumption. Rather than prioritizing fixing recycling, she said, people should place greater emphasis on scaling back their waste to begin with. Others agree that a reliance on mass-producing virgin materials poses a far bigger climate threat than limited recycling access, or habits such as wish-cycling. Minter said that some Western countries could benefit from looking to other parts of the world where, by economic necessity, people have formed better habits around recirculating resources. Porter, too, worries that recycling can perpetuate consumption and waste. A reliance on recycling, she said, can draw attention away from prioritizing \u201creduce and reuse,\u201d which do far more to lower emissions. \u201cI don't want people to think that what they do as an individual doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, but added that \u201cwe won't recycle our way out of this crisis.\u201d That doesn't mean giving up on recycling; instead, Porter advised thinking of it as a key part of materials-management efforts, rather than a singular solution to climate change. In essence, people should keep their enthusiasm for recycling alive and active\u2014but they shouldn\u2019t stop there.","headline":"How Useful Is Recycling, Really?","article_name":617851.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/01\/recycling-wont-solve-climate-change\/617851\/","date_published":"2021-01-28 12:00:00","article_length":9684,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:41.354756","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/01\/recycling-wont-solve-climate-change\/617851\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Runaway climate change once seemed like it could spur violence. Now a different risk has emerged. Back in 2015, when I started covering climate change, climate war meant one thing. At the time, if someone said that climate change posed a threat to the world order, you would assume they were talking about the direct impacts of warming, or its second-order consequences. Analysts and scholars worried over scenarios in which unprecedented droughts or city-destroying floods would prompt mass migrations, destabilizing the rich world or giving rise to far-right nationalism. Or they worried that a global famine could send food prices surging, triggering old-fashioned resource wars. Or they fretted over social science showing that weather fluctuations could lead to revolutions and civil wars. The world of 2015 is not the world of 2022. Countries have made remarkable progress averting worst-case climate scenarios since then: Canada taxes carbon pollution, Europe has its Green Deal , and the United States somehow passed the Inflation Reduction Act . What\u2019s more, elected leaders have run on these policies and won. Thanks to a global turn away from coal power, the world will likely not warm 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, as had once seemed possible . The success of the past seven years was driven home for me when I saw a German public service announcement last month that added decarbonization to the old Enlightenment trinity: \u201c Demokratie, Vielfalt & Klimaschutz. Du Bist Europa ,\u201d it read: \u201cDemocracy, diversity, and climate protection. You are Europe.\u201d What a victory. And what a complicated one. Since 2015, the risks of climate war have not entirely decreased. Instead the risks have shifted. As more countries have integrated the energy transition into their economies, a chance now exists that efforts to address climate change could encourage conflict in their own right. This shift has not happened intentionally, to be clear. It\u2019s the result of a process that climate advocates, to their credit, were among the first to note: that batteries, renewables, and zero-carbon energy are the next rung on the technological ladder. Climate hawks have rightly celebrated the news of Ukrainians using ebikes and electric drones for recon or to raid Russian tanks. But that only drives home that these innovations are \u201cdual use\u201d\u2014they can be deployed in civilian and in military contexts, and thus are non-optional for countries pursuing their security. Conflict over dual-use technologies is already at the center of U.S.-Chinese trade spats. Last month, the Biden administration effectively banned the sale of any modern semiconductor-manufacturing equipment to China. It also forbade \u201cU.S. persons\u201d\u2014a group that comprises American citizens and green-card holders\u2014from working in the Chinese semiconductor industry. As Eric Levitz writes in New York magazine , the policy amounts to a type of economic war, because \u201cit is now official U.S. policy to prevent China from achieving its development goals.\u201d This is a dangerous logic when you consider that semiconductors are crucial for decarbonization: The shift to electricity all but necessitates greater use of semiconductors. Computer chips govern nearly every part of how electric cars, scooters, water heaters, induction stoves, and more use energy or preserve it. One of the major ways that electric-vehicle makers secure a competitive advantage is by eking out tiny improvements from the computer chips and software that govern a car\u2019s battery pack. Now, the type of semiconductors affected by Biden\u2019s policies is far more advanced than the cheaper kind needed for decarbonization. But you can see how trying to prevent the other country\u2019s development can cascade from an economic disagreement into a military one. Part of what makes this dynamic tricky to manage is that the U.S. and China are productively using climate policy as a venue for their own diplomatic competition. Perhaps the most important international climate announcement of the past few years was President Xi Jinping\u2019s pledge that China would aim to reach net zero by 2060 . He announced the goal less than 2 months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and it was widely  understood as a \u201cpointed message\u201d for\u2014if not a rebuke of\u2014the United States and the Trump administration. \u201cIt demonstrates Xi\u2019s consistent interest in leveraging the climate agenda for geopolitical purposes,\u201d Li Shuo, a Greenpeace analyst, told The New York Times then. Competition has improved American policy, too. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014a law that passed in part because American legislators did not want to cede the clean-tech industry to China\u2014the United States is about to subsidize domestic solar-panel manufacturing at a massive scale. It\u2019s possible that a decade from now we will have more cheap solar panels than we know what to do with. And while that may cause substantial economic deadweight loss, it\u2019s probably good , on net, for the climate. If geopolitical competition leads America to subsidize a solar industry, then competition is probably helping climate action, not hindering it. Flooding the world with cheap solar power will not only speed up decarbonization, but also push companies to find new and creative ways to use solar panels. The most likely trigger\u2014possibly the only trigger\u2014of a full-blown war between China and the United States remains Taiwan, but we should be attentive to how conflict over trade, even when it emerges from politicians\u2019 virtuous desire to have a domestic clean-tech industry, can degrade relations between countries and push them toward zero-sum thinking. And the greatest risk from mitigation-fueled violence is not, we should be clear, to citizens of America or China or Europe. Over the past month, the Democratic Republic of Congo has seen its heaviest rebel fighting in a decade as groups allegedly backed by Rwanda try to lay claim to the country\u2019s minerals, The Wall Street Journal recently reported . Congo produces two-thirds of the world\u2019s cobalt and has the largest reserves of tantalum, a metallic element used in capacitors. At the same time, the old idea of a climate war has not vanished either. The past year has shown how much climate impacts, such as drought, can drive up the price of key commodities, fueling inflation in the rich world and food shortages elsewhere. Conventional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are far more likely than renewables or climate technology to trigger such a conflict, Dan Wang, a technology analyst at the China-based economic-research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, told me. China remains dependent on oil and natural gas from abroad; the U.S. has become a large and growing exporter of natural gas to the country. Were the U.S. to cut off those exports\u2014as it did with oil to Japan in the run-up to World War II\u2014then the risks of a bigger conflict could be far graver. For years, climate advocates argued that their issue deserved to be at the center of economic and social policy making. Climate is everything , they said. Well, to a degree, they won: Decarbonization is now at the center of how the U.S., China, and Europe conceive of the future of their economies. Climate advocates have won a seat at the table where the life-and-death matters of state and society are decided. What progress the world has made; what a long way we still have to go.","headline":"The World Could Be Entering a New Era of Climate War","article_name":672255.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/11\/climate-change-world-conflict-america-china\/672255\/","date_published":"2022-11-23 16:18:00","article_length":7403,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:41.693518","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/11\/climate-change-world-conflict-america-china\/672255\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s not just the temperature that\u2019s different. The tools used to measure it are different, too. In November 1966, the Arno River in Florence, Italy, flooded the Piazza del Duomo, located in the heart of the Renaissance city\u2019s historic center, submerging millions of classic pieces of art, rare books, and manuscripts. Among these documents were the earliest instrumental weather records from the Medici Network, the first international network of meteorological observations, which recorded temperatures from 1654 to 1670. The weather logs survived the flood, but it took decades to restore and reorganize them. When the documents finally became available again a few years ago , scientists embarked on a project to analyze their contents for the first time, but soon discovered that they faced a new set of challenges. The sheer number of data points was daunting in itself\u2014the documents included information from 13 different locations, each of which recorded the weather every three to four hours for 16 years\u2014but each of these readings also had to be translated into modern measurements. The dates and times had to be recalculated, since the old Florentine calendar began March 25 instead of January 1, and days started at twilight rather than midnight. Temperatures also had to be adapted from the Galileo scale used at the time to the Celsius scale. And there were other changes to consider: deforestation around weather stations, the construction of asphalt roads and buildings. Temperature data from hundreds of years ago is no easier to process if it\u2019s been obtained at sea. In 2004, for example, a team of researchers analyzing data from 18th- and 19th-century ships\u2019 logs \u00a0had to correct for the fact that in those days, sea-surface temperatures were measured with a thermometer in a bucket of seawater. Today, water temperatures are measured by intake pipes where seawater is taken aboard a ship, a practice that\u2019s been in place since the 1940s. (A 2008 study showed that this switch in methodology exaggerated the global temperature dip seen in the 1950s.) Data inconsistencies aren\u2019t just a pain for the people measuring\u2014they also make it harder to analyze the ways in which the planet is changing over time. Temperatures have been officially recorded in almost all regions of the world since the early 20th century. By the 1930s, records from individual temperature stations around the globe numbered in the millions. But using these records to unearth any long-term global trends involves pooling several different data sets, collected with very different methodologies across wide expanses of time and space. Unavoidably, there are gaps. In some cases, technological breakthroughs have made it impossible to directly compare readings separated by a few decades. And temperature records from many places are scattered and fragmented: Historical events often disrupt data collection (during World War II, for example, recordings from Pacific Island thermometers dropped sharply), and some areas have sparser coverage than others. And then there are the thermometers themselves. Thermometer enclosures, which shield the temperature sensor from direct sunlight and other sources of radiation, can be wooden or plastic; the variation in materials can, in turn, introduce discrepancies in the results (which some stations in the U.S. discovered firsthand in the 1980s when they switched from traditional enclosures to electronic screens). The instruments are also sensitive to their surroundings: If you measure the temperature on a sunny day versus a cloudy day, direct sunlight on the thermometer will record a higher temperature, even if the two days are equally warm. As a result, it can be hard for climate researchers to get the historical data they need. The regular fluctuations in global temperatures mean that just a few years\u2019 worth of information isn\u2019t enough; things like volcanic eruptions, solar activity, and El Ni\u00f1os can all throw short-term measurements out of whack, while pollution haze has been known in the past to cause a temporary cooling effect . To make sure the patterns they observe aren\u2019t just side effects of these other phenomena, weather statisticians make inferences about global trends by averaging 10-year temperatures. Nowadays, climate scientists have a few different tools for correcting these sorts of artificial discrepancies as the information is collected. Some have developed algorithms that identify and separate climate-change-related weather fluctuations from those attributable to some other cause. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Pairwise Homogenization Algorithm , for example, compares monthly temperatures from a network of stations, comparing the data from each one to that of its neighbors. To identify abnormalities in temperature data, the algorithm looks for abrupt shifts at one station that are absent from those surrounding it. The NOAA also runs its daily meteorological observations through quality-control measures to eliminate duplicate data, outliers, and other inconsistencies. When all of these numbers are corrected, the globe can be divided into a grid of boxes, and researchers can fill in the blanks based on satellite readings and temperature measurements from surrounding areas. In recent years, scientists have also identified ways to study weather patterns from thousands of years ago. One 2013 study , for example, extended temperatures as far back as the end of the last Ice Age\u2014more than 11,000 years ago\u2014by examining oxygen isotopes in fossilized ocean shells. Bubbles of ancient atmosphere trapped in ice can be used to gauge carbon dioxide levels from millions of years ago; fossilized shells preserve information about ocean conditions; and plant and animal microfossils from oceans can tell scientists a great deal about prehistoric temperatures, ocean currents, and wind patterns. Relating that raw data to what\u2019s happening today, though, is its own long and difficult process. On its website, the American Institute of Physics explains the history of climate studies this way: \u201cThe few pages of text and numbers were the visible tip of a prodigious unseen volume of work. One simple sentence (like \u2018last year was the warmest year on record\u2019) might be the distillation of the labors of a multi-generational global community.

In the spring of 1891, a seemingly small event in Telluride, Colorado, decisively turned the tide in favor of AC. The Ames hydroelectric-power plant, financed by mining entrepreneur L. L. Nunn, and built around equipment supplied by Westinghouse, began transmitting AC power to Nunn\u2019s gold-mining operations 2.6 miles away. It was the first successful demonstration of AC\u2019s efficiency advantages over long distances, and it led to the unveiling of AC at the 1893 Chicago World Fair, followed by Westinghouse winning the contract to build an AC-based power plant at Niagara falls. The rest is history. Edison lost the plot, and AC came to dominate the story of electricity. The victory of AC over DC, in the midst of a noisy debate fueled as much by misinformation and propaganda as by science, is the sort of outcome under uncertainty that markets excel at delivering. In 2015, the climate-change debate is where the War of Currents was in 1893. The December climate convention in Paris, COP 21 , is shaping up to be the most significant since Kyoto in 1997. It might well do for clean-energy technologies what the Chicago World Fair did for electricity. It might be an inflection point. Except this time around, the drama centers on government and UN technocrats rather than technologists and private investors. Rather than trusting market serendipity, climate experts are hoping that strong regulatory forcing combined with aggressive government investment in energy R&D will do the trick. In the November issue of The Atlantic , Bill Gates makes a persuasive case for just this approach. Is Gates right that this dual-pronged attack is necessary? Probably. Can it work? There\u2019s a slim chance. It\u2019s clear that the market is unlikely to solve the problem of climate change on its own. If scientists are right, and there is no reason to think they aren\u2019t, averting climate change will require such large-scale, rapid action, that no single energy technology, new or emerging, could be the solution. Neither could any single non-energy technology, such as video-conferencing as a substitute for travel, solve the problem on its own. There is always a possibility that a single cheap and effective solution will emerge, rendering expensive interventions moot, but few climate experts are willing to trust the future to that unlikely prospect. The challenge therefore, is one of rapid, concerted deployment of a portfolio of emerging and mature energy and non-energy technologies. This means accepting a certain level of attendant risks. The Volkwagen emissions scandal illustrates these risks well : Aggressive forcing, through EU policy instruments, of the adoption of diesel engines (which are better suited to reducing emissions) created incentives that led to sophisticated gaming. The Volkswagen scandal won\u2019t be the last or the worst. Unlike many of the other objections put forth by climate skeptics, the objection that managing moral hazards at a planetary scale might prove impossible is a solid one. Assuming we do manage to significantly accelerate deployment without cancerous levels of corporatist corruption, if emissions targets still remain out of reach, some growth must be temporarily sacrificed. At the same time, investment across the portfolio of energy technologies will need to continue. In other words, we are contemplating the sorts of austerities associated with wartime economies. For ordinary Americans, austerities might include an end to expansive suburban lifestyles and budget air travel, and an accelerated return to high-density urban living and train travel. For businesses, this might mean rethinking entire supply chains, as high-emissions sectors become unviable under new emissions regimes. What Gates and others are advocating for is not so much a technological revolution as a technocratic one. One for which there is no successful peacetime precedent. Which is not to say, of course, that it cannot work. There is always a first time for every new level of complexity and scale in human cooperation. But it\u2019s sobering to look back at the (partial) precedents we do have . Of the previous six energy revolutions of comparable magnitude\u2014wind, water, coal, oil, electricity, and nuclear\u2014only nuclear power had anywhere near the same level of early-stage technocratic shaping that we are contemplating. Among technological revolutions outside the energy sector, only space exploration, nuclear-weapons technology, and computing technology have had similar levels of bureaucratic direction. None of these are true comparables, however, for one critical reason. In each historical case, the revolution was highly focused on a single core technology rather than a broad portfolio of technologies, and a managed transition of infrastructure at civilization scale. In the case of aerospace and computing technologies, the comparison is even weaker: Those sectors enjoyed several decades of organic evolution driven primarily by inventors, private investors, and market forces before technocrats got involved. Even in the most relevant precedent, the response to ozone depletion, the technical challenge was to develop substitutes for one specific class of chemicals (CFCs) with a relatively narrow range of applications in refrigeration and aerosols. Precedents in public health, civil engineering, epidemiology, and public safety offer clearer examples of technocrat-led revolutions. But those transitions were far simpler, technologically, than a retooling of global energy infrastructure. Properly qualified, there is only one successful precedent for the kind of technological mobilization we are contemplating: the mobilization of American industry during World War II. The proposed climate change war\u2014and no other term is suitable given the scale, complexity, and speed of the task\u2014requires a level of trust in academic and energy-sector public institutions (including international ones) comparable to the trust placed in military institutions during times of war. The significant political difference is that climate change offers up no conveniently terrifying dictator, against whom to rally the troops and general population. Without a sufficiently charismatic narrative, casualties will go largely unacknowledged, like the victims of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 (which caused about twice as many deaths as World War I, but is barely remembered today outside of public-health circles). What climate change does offer in place of an evil dictator though, is a powerful appeal to parental instincts. The degree to which we are able to prevent future pain will depend strongly on the ability of politicians to establish the narrative that we must allocate high costs today, while we can still afford them, in order to save unborn generations from avertable disasters. In a time of war, the alternative to trusting the military and defense establishments is leaving all action to guerilla militias in occupied territories. In the war against climate change, the alternative to trusting technocrats, regulatory machinery, and public institutions is to trust small-scale libertarian ingenuity to bail out Bangladesh in the event of large-scale climate-change. That\u2019s not likely to happen. We either trust public institutions, based on specialized expertise, and accept the risk that they might be wrong, as in the case of the intelligence establishment and WMDs in Iraq\u2014or we limit collective action to issues where it is possible to achieve informed consensus among laypersons. The last time that was a realistic possibility in a major economy was before the rise of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the United States in 1887. This is not a comforting conclusion, but then, no decision to mobilize on a large scale for a war-like collective action ever is. So it is important to understand that this is the decision under consideration. We are not being asked to understand, en masse, the intricacies of climate science and technology deployment any more than the population of a nation at war is asked to understand the intricacies of intelligence gathering or military campaign planning. We are being asked to trust the integrity and declared intentions of institutions that do understand the intricacies. We are being asked to trust that despite any de facto ideological biases, professionalism will prevail. In the war against climate change, powerful technocrats will be far more consequential than energy-sector technologists. Think of Colonel John Boyd, widely regarded as the architect of modern American military strategy, and a renowned master of bureaucratic warfare within the Pentagon. Think of Admiral Hyman Rickover, widely credited for the extraordinary safety record of the U.S. nuclear-submarine fleet. Boyd and Rickover were exemplars of bureaucratic heroism . Both were highly effective, but largely anonymous technocrats, maneuvering imaginatively within public institutions to deploy public resources. These will be the heroes in the war against climate change. To the extent that energy technocrats are able to maneuver around bureaucratic inertia, investments at the levels suggested by Gates might pay off, and the response to climate change has a shot at success. There are early signs that this is happening. California regulator Mary Nichols\u2019s battles with the auto industry to accelerate the adoption of electric cars in California are reminiscent of Boyd\u2019s legendary battles with the military-industrial complex in the development of highly effective combat aircraft like the F16. Reposing this kind of trust in public officials can seem dangerous, but as the recent vaccine debates showed , it is even more dangerous to trust uninformed, but ideologically strident and media-savvy interest groups being misled by charismatic non-institutional figures. Lay skeptics can be relied upon to tease out the hypocrisies and obvious lies of politicians, but are far too easily misled on scientific matters. To rely on mobs to correctly interpret Sankey diagrams and ocean-acidification chemistry is like trusting a high-school football coach to correctly interpret the battle plans for the invasion of an enemy nation. Or trusting a Hollywood celebrity to meaningfully opine on vaccine biochemistry and epidemiological models. Climate change is not a game for amateurs. The evolving nature of the science, and the possibility (always present in science) that some of today\u2019s beliefs might be overturned by new evidence and models, is not a reason to second guess scientists or trust conspiracy theorists instead. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t risk corporatist corruption, cronyism, and outright wartime profiteering. But we do not yet know how to act beyond a certain scale and speed without those risks. So a technocrat-led, government-coordinated international response is probably necessary. Can it work? Like many technologists whose opinions have been shaped by Internet-era technologies, I\u2019d like to see the institutions we are being asked to trust adopt some of the operating mechanisms I have grown to trust. Like many, including presumably Bill Gates, I hope the climate war will be fought with agile, open processes, networked organizational forms, and a great deal more autonomy for low-level actors than technocracies have historically been willing to cede. I\u2019d also like claims to professional authority on the part of frontline actors to be based on visible accomplishments rather than credentials. I hope the action (or inaction, rather) will not be driven by gridlocked committees inching towards ineffective and expensive compromises with excruciating slowness, after hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis and Sub-Saharan Africans have already lost their lives or livelihoods. But to base decisions on comparisons between imaginary more-perfect institutions that might exist, and flawed, but slowly evolving institutions that do exist, is a perfect example of the nirvana fallacy . The pragmatic path is to trust that the technocrats in charge will fight the necessary bureaucratic battles with sufficient skill and professionalism to actually win in time to make a difference. Can this work? There\u2019s a slim chance, but it\u2019s probably the best chance we have. And even a small chance of preventing massive misery in parts of the world (and periods of the future) that did not cause the problem, is worth taking.","headline":"Why Solving Climate Change Will Be Like Mobilizing for War","article_name":410377.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/10\/why-only-a-technocratic-revolution-can-win-the-climate-change-war\/410377\/","date_published":"2015-10-15 13:05:51","article_length":12741,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:43.252908","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/10\/why-only-a-technocratic-revolution-can-win-the-climate-change-war\/410377\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Trees now cover most of the exclusion zone, and climate change is making them more likely to burn. I n the clear , calm, early hours of May 15, 2003, three miles west of the hulking ruins of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Vasyl Yoschenko was bustling around a stand of Scotch pines planted 30 years earlier. The trees were spindly and closely spaced, but he was skinny enough to move easily among them, taking samples of biomass and litter. Just beyond the trees, he tinkered with the horizontal plates he had placed on the ground in a diagonal grid and covered with superfine cloth designed to absorb whatever came their way. Yoschenko had just finished adjusting his monitoring equipment in the mid-afternoon when the first gusts of smoke billowed from the far side of the pines. Firefighters were torching the edges of an area the approximate size and shape of a football field. Wearing respirators, camouflage pants, and khaki shirts, cloth bandannas covering their heads, the men were systematically setting the woods ablaze. Flames leapt five feet up trunks, racing to the tops of some trees and sending plumes of smoke aloft. Yoschenko, a Ukrainian radioecologist, had planned the controlled burn to study how radioactive particulates would behave in a fire, and he knew about the risks represented by the nuclear contamination swirling overhead. He prudently scooted to the edge of the forest, donned a gas mask, and began taking photographs. Was it dangerous? Yoschenko shrugs: \u201cNot so much. We were lucky the wind didn\u2019t change direction.\u201d The forest burned intensely for 90 minutes, releasing cesium-137, strontium-90, and plutonium-238, -239, and -240 in blasts of smoke and heat. In just one hour, the firefighters\u2014and Yoschenko\u2014could have been exposed to more than triple the annual radiation limit for Chernobyl\u2019s nuclear workers. \u201cThat was crazy,\u201d says Sergiy Zibtsev, a forestry professor at the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. \u201cThat place was really contaminated. Yoschenko risked his life to provide new science\u2014just like Marie Curie.\u201d Read: Photos from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster Yoschenko\u2019s scientific blaze was a preview of Chernobyl\u2019s future. Since then, the area\u2019s climate has warmed and dried, and its wildfires\u2014most sparked by arson and other human activity\u2014have grown larger and more frequent. Each fire releases radionuclides, just as Yoschenko and his colleagues documented in 2003; each one raises anxieties in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and in Europe\u2019s major cities. But none has incinerated the landscape at the scale of the fires that burned this past April. They were far larger than any since the 1986 disaster, burning for weeks and scorching nearly 165,600 acres before rain finally doused them. Monitors in Norway, 2,000 miles away, detected increased levels of cesium in the atmosphere. Kyiv was smothered in smoke. Press reports estimated that the level of radiation near the fires was 16 times higher than normal, but we may never know how much was actually released: Yoschenko, Zibtsev, and others impatient to take on-the-ground measurements were confined to their homes by the coronavirus pandemic. August is typically the worst month of the Chernobyl fire season, and this year, public anxiety is mounting. The devastation left by the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster is colliding with the disaster of climate change, and the consequences reach far and deep. T he Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a rich mosaic of forests, grasslands, and bogs stretching 1,000 square miles across northern Ukraine. When I visited in 2013 I was shocked, like so many other visitors, by the abandoned family farmhouses with branches growing out of their empty windows, by painted silhouettes of children dancing on the walls of a community center in the hastily evacuated city of Pripyat, still haunted by their absence. But I also saw grasslands dotted with young pines, the wind wafting tawny heads of grains gone wild, and a white-tailed eagle soaring over the power plant cooling pond. In a grove of native birch trees, I stood in the morning light as it burnished the leaves against luminous white trunks. I was enchanted\u2014until my dosimeter began chattering. Had I lingered there for an hour, I later realized, I would have been exposed to radiation levels 100 times beyond what\u2019s considered safe for humans. From Hiroshima, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, we are learning about the ghastly, lingering effects of radiation on human bodies. From the uninhabited landscapes of Chernobyl, we are learning how ecosystems react to\u2014and recover from\u2014the same invisible insult. In the chaos after the April 26, 1986, disaster, Soviet officials worked frantically to contain the radiation spewing from the nuclear power plant\u2019s No. 4 reactor. To protect public health, they evacuated an area nearly the size of Yosemite National Park. Since then, only those with permission are allowed into this exclusion zone, which Ukrainians aptly call the Zone of Alienation. Ukrainian law mandates that nothing\u2014no blackberries, no mushrooms, no radionuclides\u2014leaves the zone until the radiation dissipates, a long-term proposition, given the 24,000-year half-life of plutonium-239. The unexpected result is an immense, long-term ecological laboratory. Within the exclusion zone, scientists are analyzing everything, including the health of the wolves and moose that have wandered back and the effects of radiation on barn swallows, voles, and the microorganisms that decompose forest litter. Now, as wildfires worsen, scientists are trying to determine how these hard-hit ecosystems will respond to yet another unparalleled disruption. Read: Visiting Chernobyl 32 years after the disaster Chernobyl is not a landscape inclined to burn. The Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant was built on the southwestern edge of the Pripyat Marshes, Europe\u2019s largest swamp. For centuries, the watery terrain was all but impenetrable; floods made it impassable for months at a time, and bogs disoriented persistent invaders. The drier areas were forested with birch, aspen, other hardwoods, and some pines. Late in the 19th century, these forests were cleared for intensive agriculture. But even the most enterprising farmers struggled to grow wheat and other crops in the gravelly, sandy soil. After Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union in 1922, the government returned the land to forests, logging them for fuel to produce glass and vodka. But instead of the natural mix of species, Soviet foresters planted row after evenly spaced row of Scotch pines, creating a giant softwood production area in a highly regulated forest. By the 1950s, these regularly logged pine plantations covered 400 square miles of what is now the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The explosions that wracked the nuclear power plant in 1986 transformed all life in the region, human and otherwise. Thirty-one people died as an immediate effect of the explosions, and as many as 150,000 have since died of radiation exposure in Ukraine alone. Conservative estimates predict that the death toll will grow by another 41,000; other estimates exceed 1 million. And the disaster upended the lives of those who survived: The mandatory evacuation of 350,000 people forced residents of Pripyat to leave their newly built city, farmers to abandon their fields, and loggers to find work elsewhere. The forest hit hardest by the nuclear blasts was a pine plantation that stood directly in the path of the most deadly debris. Pines are extremely sensitive to radiation, and the trees turned rust-orange before they died; workers nicknamed the plantation the \u201cRed Forest.\u201d As part of the effort to contain the radioactive material, they bulldozed it, buried the trees in more than 5 million square yards of topsoil, and covered the area with more than a foot of sand. Then they replanted it with pines. As the new trees grew, radiation in the soil suppressed an enzyme that contributes to the classic single-stem conifer shape, resulting in an expanse of odd-looking, bushy dwarf pines. The rest of the forests in the exclusion zone were simply abandoned. Management stopped, leaving the heavily industrialized forests to evolve in their own way at their own pace. Pines began creeping into less contaminated farmland. Birches and other native species less sensitive to radiation began colonizing the hotter areas, slowly replacing the Scotch pines so favored by Soviet foresters. Before the explosion of Chernobyl\u2019s nuclear reactor, forests covered about 30 percent of the exclusion zone; they now cover about 70 percent. Less than two months after the disaster, Soviet officials launched a research institution designed to study the effects of irradiation on agriculture and ecology. Renamed the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union, much of the information we have about contaminated foods and the dynamics of radionuclides has been developed here. When I arrived in 2012 at the institute, located in a suburb southwest of Kyiv, I was ushered through an imposing rotunda, where loose tiles in the beautifully ornate floor provided a percussive accompaniment as I clicked and clacked across it. Vasyl Yoschenko, then 47, was waiting in a conference room, pacing around a long table and fidgeting with his glasses. He has a thick shock of intensely white hair and a wandering left eye, which give him a slightly reckless look. In the spring of 1986, Yoschenko was a soldier in the Soviet Army, stationed 60 miles east of Moscow \u201cfor protection against the United States, of course,\u201d he told me with an ironic grin. When his service ended a month after the disaster, he was excited to return to Kyiv: \u201cIt is a beautiful city, especially in spring, so just imagine what I was feeling after two years of military service.\u201d Instead, he found an empty city. The only people on the streets were those employed to wash them down. Yoschenko resumed his education, completing a master\u2019s degree in 1989 and immediately going to work at the radiology institute. Now armed with a doctorate, he carried at the time the unwieldy title of head of the laboratory of radioecological monitoring, mathematical modeling and dosimetry. He simplified it for me: \u201cI study radiation.\u201d Read: California\u2019s wildfires are 500 percent larger due to climate change One of the institute\u2019s most important early tasks was to estimate the concentrations of radionuclides in the soil throughout the exclusion zone. In the conference room, Yoschenko pointed to two framed documents covered with polygons of colors ranging from pale green to screaming orange. Made in 1997 and 2000, these are the first maps to chart the deposits of strontium, plutonium, and other radionuclides that rained down during the disaster. With Yoschenko and others, the institute head Valery Kashparov found that two-thirds of some of the contaminants and almost all the plutonium and strontium have been retained in Ukrainian soil. That was a surprise to some scientists, who had assumed that the radionuclides would move quickly into the water table or scatter around the world in the volatile winds generated by the explosions. Instead, as much as 96 percent of radionuclide activity was confined to the top 10 centimeters of soil. Over the past 30 years, the government has largely succeeded at keeping what\u2019s in Chernobyl in Chernobyl. But the radionuclides aren\u2019t contained by Ukraine\u2019s quixotic law forbidding their movement. They\u2019re contained by functioning ecosystems. The gases and debris blasted out of the nuclear power plant fell on trees, grasses, other plants, and fungi, coating them with radionuclides; as much as 90 percent of the contamination was captured in the canopies of pines and other conifers. When their needles fell to the ground, they became part of the forest litter, slowly dispersing the radionuclides they carried into the top layer of soil. Within several years, the trees began taking up these radioactive elements; because cesium and strontium are the chemical analogues of potassium and calcium, Yoschenko and his colleagues studied how the unsuspecting trees treated them as nutrients, absorbing them into their roots and moving them into their trunks. Over time, cesium and strontium accumulate in the trees\u2019 needles, which again fall to the ground and become part of the forest litter. Without trees or other permanent ground cover, Chernobyl\u2019s radionuclides would have been carried out of the zone by wind or water. By sucking up the nuclear leftovers strewn across the landscape, the forests are stabilizing the contamination, helping prevent the spread of radionuclides south to Kyiv and northwest to Europe. T he forests\u2019 astonishing ability to both survive and contain radiation is now threatened by the worsening wildfires, exacerbated by climate change. \u201cForests are our friend in health, our enemy when they burn,\u201d says Zibtsev, the forestry professor. When Chernobyl\u2019s trees burn, they send their stored radionuclides aloft as inhalable aerosols. Instead of blasting from a single source, as it did in 1986, the contamination now comes from the trees that cover some 660 square miles around the nuclear power plant. Twenty-five years after the disaster, Zibtsev and others predicted that if the forests in the exclusion zone were completely consumed by fire, residents in Kyiv would face an increased risk of dying from cancer and government bans would need to be imposed on foods produced as far as 90 miles away. Although such a large and intense fire is currently unlikely, recent fires have been sizable enough to create similar problems. \u201cIf Chernobyl forests burn, contaminants will migrate outside the immediate area,\u201d says Zibtsev. \u201cWe know that.\u201d Zibtsev, 59, is lean and lanky, with a heavy gray crew cut that always seems fully grown out. His father, a teacher, spent the summer of 1986 working outdoors, mostly in Kyiv. He developed cataracts that he suspected were caused by his radiation exposure, though they were never officially attributed to it. Two years later Zibtsev, whose doctorate in forest ecology is from Dnipro State University, had an opportunity to do research in the irradiated forests. His parents, afraid for his safety, refused to allow it. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think I needed to risk my health over researching the migration of radionuclides in temporary waste-storage sites,\u201d he told me. His career stopped. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn down a good opportunity like this, but I did,\u201d he said. Instead, he mapped contamination in forests 150 miles west of the No. 4 reactor, where, ironically, the random patterns of radiation release deposited radionuclides that exposed him to the danger he was trying to avoid. Another offer to monitor Chernobyl forests came in 1993, and this time Zibtsev took it. He spent the next five summers collecting soil and vegetation samples that were later analyzed for traces of radionuclides. The radiation he found there was higher than it had been in the period immediately following the explosions, a surprising observation until Yoschenko\u2019s 2003 experimental burn explained it: Fires had burned 12,500 acres in 1992, ripping through the crowns of trees and depositing hot ashes across the exclusion zone in the first out-of-control blaze since the disaster. Read: The forest service is about to set a giant forest fire\u2014on purpose Zibtsev was on a Fulbright scholarship to Yale University in 2005 when he learned about catastrophic wildland fires in the western United States. \u201cWhat if that happened here?\u201d he wondered. \u201cMore than Ukraine would be affected.\u201d Zibtsev started drumming up international interest in fire and radioactive safety. Not only Chernobyl firefighters but \u201cdistant populations\u201d in other countries were at risk, he told an international conference in 2007. He began coordinating projects aimed at improving wildfire-management capacities through the Regional Eastern Europe Fire Monitoring Center, which he established in 2013 under the umbrella of the Global Fire Monitoring Center and the Council of Europe. In 2015, a rash of fires in Chernobyl brought international attention to their dangers. By that time, the abandoned forests had filled with flammable dead trees, and when farmers just outside the zone set their fields ablaze\u2014a time-honored agricultural practice\u2014the nearby stands quickly caught fire. From April to August, 37,066 acres burned within the exclusion zone. Zibtsev and his colleagues later reported that radiation releases in the zone during the fires were nearly 10 times normal levels, and that radiation levels in the forests of Chernobyl and Belarus nearly doubled in 2015. Alarmed by the potential for fire-borne radiation releases over Europe, international concern focused on the sorry state of the firefighting forces assembled in Chernobyl. In the exclusion zone, firefighters monitor smoke from rickety lookout towers built before the 1986 disaster. Access roads are deteriorating and often blocked by downed trees. Though Zibtsev helped design a system of fuel breaks creating gaps in the vegetation, the large majority have never been built. The situation is worsened by an almost complete lack of coordination among the three agencies with jurisdiction in the exclusion zone. Faced with government instability, economic chaos, and a six-year war with Russia, Zibtsev said, Ukrainian officials do not have the energy, financial resources, or political will to concentrate on fires in Chernobyl. During my 2012 visit, the firefighter Nikolay Ossienko showed me around the Paryshev Fire Station near the Belarus border, one of seven stations in the exclusion zone. A fleet of well-polished but aging four-by-four fire trucks was parked in a shed next to the wooden building that serves as the station\u2019s office. Dominating the compound was an imposing Soviet-built tank, modified with a pointed plow blade. It\u2019s used to create fuel breaks by crushing trees and brush\u2014\u201canything,\u201d explained Ossienko, a burly, blue-eyed Ukrainian whose warm smile winked with a missing tooth. Though firefighters like Ossienko maintain their equipment admirably, says Zibtsev, most of their vehicles are at least 20 years old and no longer reliable. During the April fires, many of them broke down, forcing firefighters to evacuate. In recent years, a U.S. Forest Service project has installed five fire-detection cameras within the exclusion zone, provided protective gear and breathing devices to Chernobyl firefighters, and developed a fire-management plan to coordinate fire-suppression efforts. It\u2019s very helpful, Zibtsev said, but it hasn\u2019t solved the equipment shortage. In April, camera traps, which the University of South Carolina professor Timothy Mousseau had set up to monitor wildlife, photographed men fighting fire with wet rags. \u201cNo shirts, no masks, no gloves, just wandering around in a burning fire trying to tamp it out,\u201d he told me. This April\u2019s fires, which scorched 23 percent of the exclusion zone, were the largest burns ever recorded in the area, nearly four and a half times the size of fires in 2015. Flames torched trees less than three miles from the ruined nuclear reactor, which is now enclosed by an arch-shaped steel shroud. Although the fires expose Chernobyl\u2019s firefighters to dangerous levels of radiation, their risks to residents of the region and beyond are so far relatively low. But as Zibtsev pointed out, individual health is a combination of many factors\u2014food, water, quality of life\u2014and any increase in radiation exposure, however small, adds to existing stresses. In his office, as he ticked off various threats to human health, he moved a small box around on the desktop in front of him, closer and closer to the edge. When he got to radiation, it tottered, ready to fall onto his lap. \u201cToo many stressors hasten death,\u201d he said. Fire also imposes one more stress on Chernobyl\u2019s ecosystems, a decidedly human wrench thrown into their long recovery from nuclear disaster. Induced by climate change and sparked by human activity, fire here is only slightly more natural than radiation. Persistent and widespread fire may destroy soil organics and radically redistribute the accumulated radionuclides, Yoschenko said, altering soil chemistry. Changes in soil chemistry will alter plants, which in turn will affect the food chain and animals dependent on it. And larger, more intense fires could destroy the forests entirely, obliterating their ability to keep what\u2019s in Chernobyl in Chernobyl. \u201cKeeping forests healthy is the main ingredient to preventing the migration of radionuclides outside the zone,\u201d Zibtsev told me. For now, Chernobyl\u2019s forests and grasslands are continuing to process cesium, strontium, and other radionuclides. Even the roots of the contorted trees in the Red Forest are taking up radionuclides, holding and stabilizing them in an ecosystem\u2019s gift to the humans who created these contaminants. That process promises to continue\u2014at least until the August fire season gets underway. Enjoy unlimited access to The Atlantic.

{"id":null,"body":"NASA and NOAA are both shut down, so outside scientists affirmed the milestone this week. 2018 was hotter than any year in the 19th century. It was hotter than any year in the 20th century. It was hotter than any year in the first decade of this century. In fact, with only three exceptions, it was the hottest year on Earth since 1850. Those three exceptions: 2018 was slightly cooler than 2015, 2016, and 2017. The past four years, in other words, have been the four hottest years ever reliably measured. That\u2019s according to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit research group that published its annual temperature analysis on Thursday. The new finding \u201cremains consistent with a long-term trend toward global warming,\u201d the report says. Berkeley Earth is a respected scientific organization, but it\u2019s unusual that this news should come from it alone. Normally, Americans hear about these milestones from their own government. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  were both due to publish their version of this analysis last week, on January 17. The United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office and Berkeley Earth also planned to release their own findings that day. But it was not to be. The ongoing federal shutdown has indefinitely delayed the NASA and NOAA reports, so Berkeley Earth decided to go ahead with its report. \u201cWe actually finished our analysis last week, but held off releasing it in the hope that things would be resolved,\u201d said Zeke Hausfather , an analyst for the group, in an email. \u201cBut at this point it is clear that nothing will happen soon.\u201d The report\u2019s overall findings will not surprise most scientists. The European Union\u2019s climate center has already concluded that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report But the report contains plenty of records worth noting in their own right. 2018 was the hottest year ever recorded in Antarctica, a finding with worrisome implications for sea-level rise. Twenty-nine countries\u2014including France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates, where temperatures hit 123 degrees Fahrenheit in June \u2014experienced their warmest year ever last year, too. The report also underscores that climate change has already begun\u2014and that we are running out of time to keep it under control. It finds that Earth was about 1.16 degrees Celsius warmer in 2018 than it was during the late-19th century. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that if global warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius\u2014just 0.4 degrees Celsius above where we are now\u2014then widespread environmental upheaval could result . Perhaps as soon as 2040, climate change could leave hundreds of millions of people with scarce food and water . To avoid that world, the IPCC said, \u201crapid and far-reaching\u201d energy changes were needed. So far, nothing resembling those changes has occurred\u2014though admittedly only a few months have elapsed. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide pours into the atmosphere at record rates . And given that a warm El Ni\u00f1o might develop in a few months , Berkeley Earth predicts that 2019 will \u201cvery likely be warmer than 2018.\u201d There\u2019s a coin toss\u2019s chance, it says, that we\u2019re living in the second-warmest year ever measured right now.","headline":"The World Just Experienced the Four Hottest Years on Record","article_name":581221.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/nasa-noaa-shutdown-2018-warmest-climate-record\/581221\/","date_published":"2019-01-25 12:00:00","article_length":3263,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:44.103749","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/01\/nasa-noaa-shutdown-2018-warmest-climate-record\/581221\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The two paths to avoid the worst of climate change would still dramatically change the world as we know it. Sign up for The Weekly Planet, Robinson Meyer\u2019s newsletter about living through climate change, here. Earlier this month, the United Nations\u2013led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released the latest volume of its current \u201csynthesis report,\u201d its omnibus summary of what humanity knows about the climate. As I wrote at the time , while the other volumes focus on the impacts of climate change, this newest report narrows in on how to prevent it. One of the main tools that the volume uses to estimate how we might avert climate catastrophe is so-called energy-system models. These are complicated computer programs that simulate the global economy\u2019s use of energy in all its guises\u2014coal, natural gas, wind, solar\u2014and what the greenhouse-gas footprint of that energy use will be. A single model might encompass natural-gas demand in Mongolia, highway usage in Scotland, electric-vehicle purchases in New Jersey, and thousands of other numbers before spitting out a certain year\u2019s carbon emissions. These models are useful because they produce scenarios: story lines that show how the world can meet its energy needs while gradually zeroing out its carbon pollution. They can help us understand how current\u2014and future\u2014 energy policy will affect the trajectory of emissions. (By feeding the output of energy-system models into climate models, which project how the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will alter temperature, precipitation, and much else, you can then see how those emissions will drive climate change.) The models can tell us, for instance, that based on the commitments countries initially made under the Paris Agreement, the world\u2019s average temperature is set to rise more than 2 degrees Celsius above its preindustrial level, violating the very goal of that treaty. Of course, that has long been clear. But the energy-system models used in the most recent IPCC report tell us something else too: The path to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires something impossible . Well, not actually impossible, but exceptionally difficult to imagine. Of the hundreds of scenarios that the IPCC analyzed, all fell into one of three buckets. In the first bucket, every scenario forecasts that the world will soon be removing tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. Carbon removal is still a bit of a dream. Not only is it technologically unproven at scale; it is extremely energy intensive. But the IPCC report implies that within the lifetime of children alive today, the world might be spending more than a third of its total energy production removing carbon from the atmosphere, according to Zeke Hausfather, an IPCC author. The world won\u2019t derive any immediate economic gain from this waste-management exercise; it won\u2019t turn that carbon into something useful. It will simply need to spend what could equal trillions of dollars a year on carbon removal to help rein in climatic upheaval. What\u2019s more, this mass removal will need to happen while the world does everything else that decarbonizing entails, such as building wind and solar farms, expanding public transit, and switching to electric vehicles. Every climate plan, every climate policy you\u2019ve ever heard about will need to happen while tens of gigatons of carbon removal revs up in the background. That may sound unbelievable. But now let\u2019s turn our attention to the second bucket of scenarios. They tell a different story, one in which the world rapidly curtails its energy usage over the next two decades, slashing carbon pollution not only from rich countries, such as the United States, but also from middle-income countries, such as Brazil, Pakistan, and India. By \u201ccurtailing energy demand,\u201d I\u2019m not talking about the standard energy-transition, green-growth situation, where the world produces more energy every year and just has a larger and larger share of it coming from zero-carbon sources. Rather, these scenarios imagine a world where total global energy demand collapses in the next few decades. There\u2019s a good reason for this\u2014as far as the models are concerned, this tactic is one of the best ways to crash carbon pollution within 10 years\u2014but it is not how any country approaches climate policy. Take these scenarios\u2019 assumptions about car ownership, for example. Today, there are about 1.3 billion cars and light-duty trucks on the road worldwide. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that this number will reach 2.21 billion by 2050\u2014a 70 percent increase\u2014of which less than half will be electric vehicles. But the low-energy scenarios require the global vehicle fleet to nearly halve during the same period of time, shrinking to about 850 million cars and light trucks by 2050. Don\u2019t get me wrong: This sounds fantastic. I\u2019d love to live in a world where most people don\u2019t have to own a car to make a living or participate in society. Yet it also does not strike me as particularly likely, and it is not the only life-altering shift imagined by the low-energy scenarios. These scenarios envision a similar revolution in energy-efficiency technology sweeping through other aspects of society, such as building construction, residential heating, and manufacturing. Historically, energy efficiency has improved by about 2 percent a year; the low-energy-demand scenarios require much faster shifts. Oh, and by the way, these low-energy-demand scenarios require a huge amount of carbon removal too\u2014something like 3 billion tons of it. \u201cEven with low-energy demand, there\u2019s still a fair amount of [carbon removal] deployed. It\u2019s just in the three-to-five-gigaton range rather than the five-to-15-gigaton range,\u201d Hausfather, the IPCC author, told me. (He recently became the lead climate researcher at the online-payment company Stripe, which has paid to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than any other company.) And then there\u2019s the third bucket. In these scenarios in the new report, humanity fails to limit global temperature growth to 1.5 degrees Celsius (or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), blowing past the more ambitious of the Paris Agreement\u2019s climate goals. Passing 1.5 degrees Celsius means that the world could encounter deadly droughts, mass migrations, and fatal outdoor temperatures by the middle of the century. Perhaps you can see the problem: None of these outcomes is particularly easy to imagine. There is no international agreement\u2014or even political will\u2014to conduct carbon removal at the scale that the IPCC report envisions. There is even less appetite for the rapid energy cuts that must come in this decade to meet the low-energy-demand scenario. And if you give up on either of those approaches, that all but ensures the world will exceed the 1.5-degree-Celsius threshold, which will lead to widespread turmoil. When you look at the three buckets this starkly, a few things become apparent. The first and the most significant is that humanity must invest more in carbon removal as quickly as possible. So far, most of the money spent on carbon removal has come from the private sector; two weeks ago, I wrote about Stripe\u2019s effort. But the funding to remove billions of tons a year can come only from the government. Many climate thinkers hope that the federal government will step in and administer carbon removal as a public waste-management service, at least in the United States. There\u2019s currently little bipartisan political will to do so, but it is beyond past time to begin implementing that. The second is that coping with climate change will require disruption on a scale that our political system has yet to comprehend. In some cases, that disruption will come beforehand and prevent the damage; in others, it will result from the climatic damage. But it will come nonetheless. If I asked you, Forty years from now, will only about 5 percent of Americans own a car, or will the world spend a large share of its energy production sucking carbon from the atmosphere?, you would rightly respond that neither sounded particularly realistic. And that is the point: We have been backed into a corner. The scale of change headed our way is unimaginable. And it is also inevitable.","headline":"There\u2019s No Scenario in Which 2050 Is \u2018Normal\u2019","article_name":629691.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/ipcc-report-climate-change-2050\/629691\/","date_published":"2022-04-27 14:03:00","article_length":8264,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:44.976710","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/04\/ipcc-report-climate-change-2050\/629691\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Farmers in Bangladesh are adapting to climate change, and it\u2019s having an impact in faraway places\u2014including on restaurant menus. DHAKA, Bangladesh\u2014Here at Binni, a slightly run-down restaurant in one of Dhaka\u2019s trendier neighborhoods, beef, chicken, and mutton dishes are slapped down on the table with a mere murmur. But when the waiter brings Hash Bhuna to the table, he announces it to the whole room, laying down the plate and pulling off the ceramic lid with a theatrical hand flick. Coated in a thick layer of spicy sauce, the duck ( hash in Bengali) is succulent and dark, and well deserving of its reputation as a traditional South Asian delicacy. Once a special treat reserved for winter, Hash Bhuna is more and more available out of season. And in Dhaka\u2019s growing number of East Asian restaurants, duck dishes are also always on the menu these days. A four-hour drive away, in Bangladesh\u2019s wetland region, Shopna Akter\u2019s life, too, has changed. She used to raise chickens while her husband worked as a laborer on rice paddies nearby. Climate change has made that way of life unpredictable, though\u2014sudden floods caused rice crops and chickens to perish and incomes to plummet. Recently the couple switched and began raising ducks, a business that is now prospering. The reason for their success? \u201cDucks,\u201d Akter told me matter-of-factly, \u201ccan swim.\u201d They are part of a duck-farming program introduced by a local nongovernmental organization, BRAC , which, along with other NGOs elsewhere in the country, is trying to help farmers adapt to changing weather conditions. This is just one among a growing array of efforts to help the vulnerable around the world cope with the effects of climate change without forcing them to move away\u2014the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, a Switzerland-based NGO, says 17.2 million people were displaced worldwide last year because of fast- and slow-onset climate-related disasters. Yet programs such as the one here illustrate the manifold impact that such adaptation programs have, not just for those doing the adapting, but for others as well, affecting everyday issues such as what is on the menu at a faraway restaurant. As a delta country, full of rivers and surrounded by the sea, Bangladesh is one of the places most affected by climate change, and the eighth most prone to natural disasters, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It faces myriad issues, including rising sea levels, river and coastal erosion, increased water and soil salinity, flooding, drought, storms, and cyclones. The Haors, the wetlands where Akter lives, used to have regular rains, says Miganur Rahman, a BRAC staffer, but now precipitation is unpredictable. There are periods of both unexpected flooding and drought. This has a big impact on paddy farmers: When the rain comes too early, they cannot harvest their crops, and lose their investment. Unpredictable rainfall in neighboring India also has an impact, says Feisal Rahman, a research coordinator at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development , a Dhaka-based think tank: The steep slope from the Himalayas means that when it rains across the border, the Haors are hit by \u201ca deluge of water.\u201d BRAC is trying to scale up duck farming to create a more resilient livelihood for people in the Haors, where previously ducks were raised only on a small scale. The organization carefully selects people\u2014mostly women\u2014to receive training in duck raising and an interest-free loan of 100,000 taka (about $1,200). The advantages of ducks for farmers such as Akter are several. Chickens catch infections much more easily than ducks do when they get wet, too hot, or too cold, Helal Uddin, the BRAC agriculturalist who first came up with the duck program, told me. And when it rained, Akter and her husband had to pay to raise the floor of their coop to protect the chickens, cutting into their profits. The couple \u201chad to stress about selling them as soon as possible,\u201d Akter said. Ducks are also more profitable, selling for almost twice as much as similar-size chickens. While the price might eventually go down as supply increases, duck raising still provides a year-round income\u2014unlike rice crops, which, because of the region\u2019s weather patterns, can be harvested only once a year. Akter\u2019s ducks are sold as meat, but others are involved in different parts of duck farming. A decade ago, Pinku Das and his wife, Shipra, started to raise ducks for eggs when his work as a day laborer was not bringing in enough money. For the first four years, the couple had only about 20 ducks, but after receiving a loan and training from BRAC, they were able to scale up their business. Now they have a few thousand ducks and are collecting at least 500 eggs a day, and their income has jumped about tenfold. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge value chain,\u201d says Miganur Rahman, the BRAC staffer. \u201cA whole economic shift is taking place, which started just a few years ago\u2014all because of ducks.\u201d In just the Haors, BRAC says about 300 families are involved in hatching, 2,000 raise the ducklings, and an additional 4,000 farm adult ducks. Elsewhere in the country, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and CARE International run other duck-raising projects. Nor is it just ducks. In the southwest of Bangladesh, crab fattening is on the rise. Its proponents hope crabs, which sell at high prices\u2014especially the meatier ones\u2014can form part of a new coastal economy, stemming the tide of migration to the cities. Rising sea levels and the increased intrusion onto arable land of salt water, which makes soil infertile, have made traditional agriculture farming impossible for many who live in this region, which borders the Sundarban mangrove forest. As a result, farmers have, over several years, shifted from paddy farming to shrimp cultivation. This, however, has created fresh problems, as it requires regularly bringing more salty water inland, further destroying the farmland needed to grow crops and causing more environmental damage. Much like the duck-raising programs, organizations such as the British-based charity Voluntary Service Overseas and the United Nations Development Program are providing loans and training for crab fattening. According to VSO\u2019s program manager, Shafiqur Rahman, this is less environmentally damaging and more profitable than shrimp cultivation. Crabs are also more disease-resistant and more resilient to change in water salinity than shrimp are. And farmers typically need far fewer crabs, which are easier to take care of, to make the same profit. Besides crabs, the UNDP project is introducing cow, goat, and pig fattening and hydroponic vegetable-growing (which involves cultivating plants in a mineral-nutrient solution rather than soil) to help communities that have been left landless by river erosion and rising soil salinity. The efforts also have the consequence of arresting migration from these areas to cities. Sapna Khan, who lives on the edge of the Sundarbans, uses the additional money she has earned by raising goats to put her son through school. \u201cI want him to be able to stay here and make a living, not have to leave for the city,\u201d she told me. In the Haors, Akter\u2019s life has already changed. A few years ago, her ducks went no farther than the nearest town, Habiganj, where, in the local markets\u2014at that time disconnected from national business chains\u2014they were sold at artificially low prices. Now they are carried by traveling duck traders along the bumpy tracks from her village of Kander Hathi to the Sylhet-Dhaka highway, and hawked in the hubbub of one of the capital\u2019s bazaars. Finally, they end up diced and spiced on plates in restaurants like Binni, and in the bellies of well-to-do Dhakaites\u2014happy to pay hundreds of taka for a morsel of Hash Bhuna.","headline":"To Survive in a Wetter World, Raise Ducks, Not Chickens","article_name":593581.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2019\/07\/bangladesh-climate-change-floods-ducks\/593581\/","date_published":"2019-07-13 09:00:00","article_length":7826,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:45.002078","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2019\/07\/bangladesh-climate-change-floods-ducks\/593581\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Ain\u2019t no mountain high enough to escape climate change. In 1985, John Fitzpatrick hiked up a ridge called Cerro de Pantiacolla, in the Peruvian Andes, in search of birds. On an eight-kilometer uphill walk, he and his team meticulously documented all the birds that lived on the mountainside. They found dozens of species, many with delightfully ostentatious names. The buff-browed foliage-gleaner. The hazel-fronted pygmy-tyrant. The fulvous-breasted flatbill. The variable antshrike. After their census, they returned to their base camp on the banks of the Palatoa River, and Fitzpatrick took a photo of the Andes, towering in the distance. Then they sailed away. Thirty years later, Benjamin Freeman , an ecologist at the University of British Columbia and a former student of Fitzpatrick\u2019s, decided to retrace the same hike to see whether the birdlife had changed in the intervening decades. \u201cWe motored up the river in a canoe, literally holding up that photo, until we said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re here,\u2019\u201d Freeman says. As they climbed, the thickets of tall bamboo by the river gave way to big rainforest trees with huge buttress roots. And at the top of the ridge, 1,400 meters up, the team found a \u201cgnarled, mossy wonderland of stunted trees,\u201d Freeman says. What they did not find , however, was the buff-browed foliage-gleaner, the hazel-fronted pygmy-tyrant, the fulvous-breasted flatbill, or the variable antshrike. They had all disappeared. Mountains vary substantially as they rise, in both climate and vegetation, like layered cakes in which every tier is radically different. For that reason, mountains are hotbeds for the birth of new species, many of which tend to stick to a very narrow band of altitude. That\u2019s true even for birds. It\u2019s easy to imagine that, being winged, they can travel wherever they like, but they too are restricted by layers of climate. And those restrictions are changing. Read: Urban bird feeders are changing the course of evolution. As the planet slowly warms, the cooler, higher layers of mountains are becoming like the warmer ones at lower altitudes. Animals and plants are tracking these changes, moving upslope in search of their ideal climes. Apollo butterflies have moved 200 meters up the faces of Spanish mountains. Pikas \u2014hamsterlike relatives of rabbits\u2014have disappeared from much of California\u2019s Sierra Nevadas, first from the lowest elevations and then eventually from the highest ones, too. In Cerro de Pantiacolla, Freeman calculated that birds would have to move about 75 meters upslope to experience the temperatures they enjoyed back in 1985. The reality wasn\u2019t quite that stark. When Freeman and his colleagues compared their two censuses, they realized that the ridge\u2019s birds are now living, on average, 40 meters higher than they used to. But of the 16 species that once lived at the ridge\u2019s summit, eight were nowhere to be seen. It\u2019s as if all the birds in Cerro de Pantiacolla have been slowly moving upwards, and those that were already at the top just ran out of mountain. Of course, it\u2019s possible that the team just failed to find the missing birds. But five of these species were common back in 1985, and seven have distinctive songs that should have been obvious parts of the dawn chorus. Freeman thinks that at least some of them really are gone\u2014and others will likely follow. The scarlet-breasted fruiteater, deep-blue flowerpiercer, and russet-crowned warbler now live only in the highest 100 meters of the ridge. After another decade of warming, they will probably disappear, too. As the team wrote, \u201cIn the timespan of just one and a half human generations, warming of less than 0.5 degrees Celsius has set in motion an escalator to extinction for Andean birds.\u201d To clarify, none of the missing species is extinct yet ; they also live on other, taller mountains that provide more space into which they can ascend. But what happened in Cerro de Pantiacolla is likely to happen elsewhere, and even the loftiest mountains are finite. In that sense, the ridge\u2019s birds are harbingers of the future\u2014the hazel-fronted pygmy-tyrants in the coal mine. Read: Can fear alone drive animals to extinction? \u201cFor over 30 years, scientists have been concerned that global warming will cause mountaintop extinctions, but until now there has been little evidence,\u201d says Morgan Tingley from the University of Connecticut. Freeman\u2019s study changes that. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, like a nightmare come true. It may just be one study from one isolated mountain, but it\u2019s still alarming. If this is how climate change will play out across tropical mountains, then we\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d In a way, it\u2019s surprising that scientists haven\u2019t detected more of these disappearances before. One study predicted that a global temperature rise of 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) would kill off between 400 and 550 bird species, solely by pushing them off the top of the extinction escalator. And yet \u201cthere are few examples where people have actually validated that this is happening,\u201d Freeman says, \u201cand it hasn\u2019t been for lack of effort.\u201d The problem, he says, is that most researchers have looked for mountaintop extinctions in temperate parts of the world, where animals already have to cope with climates that fluctuate wildly with the seasons. \u201cA little bit of warming might not matter that much to them,\u201d Freeman says. But in the tropics, where temperatures are more stable year-round, animals can become more tightly bound to a narrow range of conditions\u2014and more vulnerable when those conditions change. Freeman first found evidence of this in 2014, when he and his wife, Alexandra Class Freeman, visited two mountains in Papua New Guinea that an ornithologist had studied in the 1960s. Forty years later, most of the birds had moved to higher regions. It\u2019s not entirely clear why this happens. The birds\u2019 bodies could operate best in specific temperatures. Alternatively, \u201cthe warming might matter to the insects, and the insects matter to the birds,\u201d Freeman says. Either way, he suspects that the extinction escalator runs far faster in the tropics than it does elsewhere. \u201cBarring reducing rates of climate change, what can you do?\u201d Freeman asks. The best interim solution is to preserve tracts of forest that ascend up mountainsides\u2014corridors in which species can travel as warming temperatures push them upward. \u201cOn the main Andes, if you protect a big swath of land, you\u2019ll provide the space for the plants and animals to live in as they move up the mountain,\u201d Freeman says. As for smaller mountains like Pantiacolla, \u201cthey\u2019re not tall enough to handle a lot of upslope shifts,\u201d he adds. \u201cThese places are basically shit out of luck.\u201d","headline":"Animals Are Riding an Escalator to Extinction","article_name":574294.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/mountain-animals-are-riding-escalator-extinction\/574294\/","date_published":"2018-10-29 19:00:00","article_length":6687,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:45.054224","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/mountain-animals-are-riding-escalator-extinction\/574294\/","source":"atlantic"}

During the primary debates, Democratic candidates repeatedly accused each other of using \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d But it was Andrew Yang who actually deployed a hyper-conservative argument on Wednesday night\u2014albeit one that had somehow time traveled from the year 2080. Asked in very general terms about his climate-change plan, Yang, a former technology executive, made a few points. Almost all of them were terrible. \u201cThe important number in this is 15 percent of global emissions,\u201d Yang began, referring to the U.S. share of overall carbon pollution. \u201cWe like to act as if we\u2019re 100 percent. Even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the Earth is going to get warmer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in history. We are too late. We are 10 years too late.\u201d Okay, let\u2019s stop there. Yang is correct about a number of facts here. The United States does emit about 15 percent of the world\u2019s carbon pollution. Even if the U.S. cut emissions now, the world would keep getting warmer. (That would be true even if the entire world cut carbon emissions, by the way\u2014the thing about filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases is that they will keep mindlessly capturing heat until they are absorbed or dissolve.)

We will need to adapt to climate change\u2014and frankly, few leaders talk enough about adaptation. (Several candidates onstage last night, including Washington Governor Jay Inslee and former Vice President Joe Biden, have adaptation plans.) But the game is not lost. The planet could still follow a range of emission outcomes, including a not very bad one and a catastrophic worst-case scenario . The worst, fastest sea-level rise seems like it may kick in between two and three degrees Celsius\u2014and extraordinary action could yet hold that off. Nor is the United States\u2019 15 percent share of global emissions reason for despair. First of all, the U.S. is the second-largest producer of carbon emissions. Second, there is a good response available to America\u2019s emissions\u2014and Yang, a former tech worker, should know it. The United States must develop decarbonization technologies here that can be sold or transferred to the rest of the world. That is why so many candidates stress the importance of R&D and why Inslee and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have talked about green manufacturing. This was not the end of Yang\u2019s argument. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut we also need to start moving our people to higher ground\u2014and the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.\u201d Read: Climate change is already damaging American democracy Maybe I\u2019m overreacting. Maybe Yang is just very good at staying on message. He is, after all, referring to his signature proposal, a universal basic income that would assure every American $1,000 a month. And, like, \u2026 sure \u2026 I guess. It is true\u2014it is obviously true\u2014that people who have more money will be less vulnerable to any one disaster. And people who are facing disaster should have more money. Protection from vulnerability is basically what wealth is . But handing out money is not an adaptation policy. And $1,000 a month is not a good response to losing your house to higher sea levels, which is the malady Yang seems to be implying. It is certainly not a collective adaptive approach to the challenge of climate change . Think about it this way. Asked about climate change on national television, Yang said that climate change is an inexorable problem, that the U.S. can\u2019t do much of anything about it, and that if the seas take your house\u2014that is, if a problem outside your control deprives you of your most expensive asset\u2014then the government shouldn\u2019t do anything specifically to help you. That is quite an argument. It does not strike me as one well chosen for a party whose voters care about climate change and who are moving to the left.","headline":"Andrew Yang Is Not Your Climate Friend","article_name":595267.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/andrew-yangs-horrific-debate-answer-climate-change\/595267\/","date_published":"2019-08-01 04:05:19","article_length":4535,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:46.122948","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/andrew-yangs-horrific-debate-answer-climate-change\/595267\/","source":"atlantic"}

The brain behind the project is Bjorn Lomborg, author of 2001's The Skeptical Environmentalist , a book that downplays dire predictions about global warming. While Lomborg is careful to note that the global warming threat is something to be taken seriously, he argues that governments are combating it in a way that is costly and extremely inefficient. In Cool It, he gives several examples (more investment in alternative energies, geoengineering, third world health and education) of what he believes are better investments in the future. Carbon credits and cap-and-trade legislation, he argues, are vulnerable to corruption and will only have a negligible effect on stopping rising temperatures. Needless to say, Lomborg's sentiment has been championed by conservatives and derided as dangerous by some scientists who believe that his argument only emboldens climate change skeptics. Here's what critics are saying about the film's arguments, and how Lomborg is actively responding to these charges.","headline":"Debating the Climate Change Proposals In 'Cool It'","article_name":343328.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/11\/debating-the-climate-change-proposals-in-cool-it\/343328\/","date_published":"2010-11-20 11:00:00","article_length":1194,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:46.847326","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2010\/11\/debating-the-climate-change-proposals-in-cool-it\/343328\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Despite changes, a key Democrat says the bill would block climate work. A key Democratic lawmaker says that a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on a customs bill still contains language that would block the U.S. from using trade pacts to cut back on greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014and he\u2019s urging other Democrats to block the bill over the issue. House and Senate lawmakers this week unveiled a deal on the customs bill, which would reauthorize U.S. Customs and Border Protection and set policy on trade agreements at the border. The bill is set for a House vote on Friday. Democrats and environmentalists had balked at the original House version of the bill, in part because of an amendment that would have barred any trade deals that required the U.S. to make any new obligations to fight global warming. Republicans inserted the language over concerns that the White House would use fast-track trade powers to jam through new climate deals, but environmentalists warned it would put a freeze on the U.S. climate negotiations. The conference report softened that language. Rather than climate change, it now refers only to \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions\u201d (still the largest part of climate policy) and it authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to keep working on greenhouse-gas policy if that\u2019s the main objective of the talks. A Senate aide said the measure would not block negotiators from reaching a greenhouse-gas emissions cap. But Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said that even softened, the language is a nonstarter for him, and should be for the rest of the caucus. \u201cThe whole purpose of it was to tie the hands of our negotiators on climate change,\u201d Levin said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have much of an impact, it wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d Levin distributed a brief to members urging them to vote no and raising several objections to the bill, including what he called \u201cmeaningless\u201d language on currency manipulation and a provision he said would weaken tools to address human trafficking. As for the climate language, Levin wrote that it would \u201cprevent us from negotiating provisions like common fuel efficiency standards\u2014a very real possibility in our ongoing negotiations with Europe right now\u2014even if the common standard is good for both the environment and for our automakers who may prefer to build to one standard instead of two.\u201d Only 12 Democrats voted for the original bill (in contrast, the Senate version, which didn\u2019t have climate language, passed 80-20 in May) and Levin said that his caucus remained \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d opposed. On the Senate side, Democrat Ron Wyden, ranking member on the Finance Committee, and Democrat Debbie Stabenow both signed off on the bill. A Senate aide said that the climate provision wouldn\u2019t go as far as Levin warned. The original climate amendment was inserted into the House customs bill as an olive branch to House Republicans amid fears about fast-track trade authority. Rep. David McKinley of West Virginia, for example, had warned that such authority could allow President Obama to \u201cman\u00addate a re\u00adduc\u00adtion in the use of nat\u00adur\u00adal gas and coal at home and abroad, im\u00adple\u00adment his con\u00adtro\u00adver\u00adsial cli\u00admate-change agenda, and im\u00adpose rad\u00adic\u00adal en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment\u00adal\u00adist reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions.\u201d Environmental groups, however, said the language was simply meant to block the U.S. from making any international progress on climate change. In a joint letter, several green groups wrote that it would \u201climit the United States\u2019 latitude to safeguard climate policies from trade attacks under existing and future trade agreements\u201d and put a dent in climate language requested by the European Union in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. A spokeswoman for Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, who requested the original language, said he would back the revised version. \u201cHe finds it acceptable because he received assurance from [U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman] that the [Trade Promotion Authority] bill does not provide the administration any new authority to enter into climate-change agreements,\u201d said spokeswoman Nicole Tieman. And despite assurances from Senate Democrats, Levin said he\u2019s still opposed. He alluded to the ongoing United Nations climate change talks in Paris and said he wasn\u2019t sure if the language would hamper U.S. action there. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear \u2026 and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. Likewise, environmental groups remain opposed. \u201cAs the world negotiates an agreement for how to address climate change, the United States Congress is trying to explicitly exclude its consideration in trade agreements,\u201d said Friends of the Earth President Erich Pica. \u201cPresident Obama needs to stop allowing trade to trump climate change. We ask President Obama to make it clear that he will veto this legislation if it comes to his desk.\u201d","headline":"How a Customs Bill Ignited a Fight Over Climate Change","article_name":453051.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/how-a-customs-bill-ignited-a-fight-over-climate-change\/453051\/","date_published":"2015-12-11 01:00:00","article_length":4803,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:47.316629","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/how-a-customs-bill-ignited-a-fight-over-climate-change\/453051\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"With the executive and legislative branches refusing to act, the judicial branch might be the last hope. Climate change is crashing into America\u2019s courts. As the science gets more conclusive, the reality more sobering, and the predictions more dire, the executive and legislative branches have refused to act. That leaves the judicial branch. In theory, courts are a good place for climate science. Unlike legislative bodies, where bills based on science can be derailed just because a few people say they don\u2019t \u201cbelieve in\u201d climate change, the courts have evidentiary standards. If something\u2019s real, it\u2019s real. The facts accepted by 98 percent of scientists worldwide represent pretty convincing evidence. In the past couple of years, activists and attorneys and even state governments have been trying to use the courts to force action, protect those who take matters into their own hands, and wring payouts from offending companies. These climate cases are taking a number of different forms. And they\u2019re lined up to the horizon. First there are civil-rights cases, which fault the government for not protecting American citizens. In a case now on hold in federal court in Oregon, 21 young people are suing the government for failing to curb climate-change-causing CO2 emissions and thus violating their \u201cfundamental constitutional rights to freedom from deprivation of life, liberty and property.\u201d Juliana v. United States was filed in 2015 under Barack Obama and has survived years of challenges. With the trial originally scheduled to begin October 29, the Supreme Court\u2014which previously ruled unanimously in July that the trial could proceed\u2014has now issued a temporary stay while it considers a last-minute challenge from the Justice Department. Attorneys plan to call a spectacular array of expert witnesses, including the former NASA climate scientist James Hansen, who first testified before Congress in 1988 that climate change was already underway. Garrett Epps: The government is trying to silence 21 kids hurt by climate change. Philip Gregory, one of the attorneys representing the young plaintiffs in Juliana , says he hopes for an act of judicial courage such as in Brown v. Board of Education , in which segregation was proven to harm children and the high court agreed that the federal government had to protect them. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking the Supreme Court to find new rights,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cBased on the evidence that we will introduce at trial, these children are being harmed, the federal government is harming them, and it is up to the judiciary to issue orders to stop the harm.\u201d Civil-rights suits like this are gaining traction globally. On October 9, a Dutch appeals court upheld one such decision forcing the Netherlands to drastically cut its greenhouse-gas emissions. Similar cases are ongoing in other European countries. The advocacy group supporting Juliana , Our Children\u2019s Trust, has also helped young people advance similar cases in state courts across the country. Since 2011, it\u2019s filed petitions in all 50 states to force government agencies to use the best climate science in rule making; it brings civil-rights cases when those petitions are denied. In Alaska, for example, 16 youths are suing the state, and as in Juliana , they are not asking for money. They are asking for \u201cscience-based numeric reductions in Alaska\u2019s \u2026 emissions consistent with global emissions reduction rates necessary to stabilize the climate system.\u201d Read: Donald Trump is the first demagogue of the Anthropocene. Since those reductions are not happening anytime soon, lawyers are also trying another approach to environmentalism in the courts: The \u201cnecessity defense,\u201d or the argument that government inaction on climate change essentially compelled their clients to act unlawfully. On October 8 and 9, I covered the Minnesota trial of Emily Johnston, 52, Annette Klapstein, 66, and Ben Joldersma, 40, who were granted the first-ever U.S. trial in which a judge planned to instruct the jury to consider a climate necessity defense. The three broke into an oil-pipeline facility owned by the Canadian multinational company Enbridge near tiny Leonard, Minnesota, in 2016, cut the locks on large shutoff valves, and stopped the flow of oil. Together with three other principle activists who carried out similar acts on the same day in North Dakota, Montana, and Washington State, the \u201cValve Turners,\u201d as they became known, cut off most of the tar-sands oil coming into the U.S. from deposits in Alberta, Canada. The necessity defense, which has been used in the past by anti-abortion and anti-nuclear-weapons protesters, is a prize long sought by climate activists. Judge Robert Tiffany\u2019s decision to grant it shocked just about everyone. It was denied at the other three Valve Turner trials, in which judges ruled that activists had plenty of other options for legal action. In Minnesota, defendants were ready to argue that climate change was so threatening, and that the government had taken so little action despite their decades of activist work such as lobbying and protesting and voting, that shutting down the pipeline was their only recourse. But they never got a chance to say their piece: They were acquitted mid-trial, when Tiffany ruled that cutting a lock didn\u2019t count as damage. (The main charge against them was damaging a pipeline.) So they went free. Klapstein, a retired attorney, said, \u201cI\u2019m not inside this judge\u2019s mind, but it does seem like they find some way to back off [the necessity defense] every time it gets close.\u201d It\u2019s getting closer and closer. In 2016, climate activists known as the Delta Five, who\u2019d blocked an oil train in Everett, Washington, were allowed to present a necessity defense. However, the judge then told the jury to ignore that information, even as he praised the defendants. In 2018, a judge in Massachusetts found that 13 people who had blocked the construction of a new gas pipeline were \u201cnot responsible\u201d by reason of climate necessity. But it wasn\u2019t a jury trial. These cases are happening across the country. On October 25, three climate activists pleaded their necessity to a judge in Cortlandt, New York, after they stopped a Spectra\/Enbridge pipeline project for 18 hours. The decision in that case is expected later this year. Read: Trump\u2019s new view of climate change The Minnesota trial holds a door open for more jury cases. The state appealed the use of the necessity defense in a jury trial, and it was upheld all the way to the state supreme court. Lauren Regan, the lead attorney on all four of the Valve Turner trials, said that her office, the Civil Liberties Defense Center in Eugene, Oregon, has trained more than 1,000 activists on legal defense in the past few years, and she tries to impress upon them that using the necessity defense has very stringent legal requirements. But she still gets at least one call a week from someone planning to use it. Just like in Minnesota, it\u2019s going to take a judge who is willing to let a jury decide. \u201cJudges are abrogating the role of juries in favor of the fossil-fuel industry, and whether you\u2019re talking about the Our Children\u2019s Trust case or the Valve Turners or any cases in the future, if we do not reinstate the role and the power of a jury, then he who has the most money is also going to control the courtroom,\u201d Regan said. Money may be a last recourse if policy-oriented suits fail. Since 2017, local governments getting hammered by hurricanes, wildfires, and new sea-rise infrastructure bills have been going after Big Oil. They\u2019re seeking either monetary damages or, in the latest development, to force fossil-fuel companies to reimburse shareholders for hiding their liability for climate change. The City of Baltimore, for example, sued BP, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and 23 other oil companies in July 2018, alleging that they\u2019ve contributed directly to a projected 2.1-foot rise in sea level from 2000 to 2050, life-threatening heat waves, more severe flooding, increased drought, and a continued increase in adverse health effects like asthma. All of these problems are costing the city money right now as it tries to adapt. \u201cThere are a couple of things that make these cases especially timely,\u201d said Vic Sher, whose firm, Sher Edling, is representing Baltimore and seven other communities, including the state of Rhode Island, in similar suits. \u201cOne is the development of science in the last decade that allows really robust connections causally between emissions on the one hand and a range of climate-change-related impacts on the other, as well as the ability to attribute emissions to particular companies.\u201d The other, he adds, is the discovery that oil companies have known about the effects of climate change for as long as 50 years. They misrepresented future climate-change costs to their boards and shareholders, and actively fomented climate denial as a strategy to prevent regulatory action. \u201cThe combination of those three factors\u2014causation, attribution, and culpability\u2014is really what underlies the strength of the current generation of cases,\u201d Sher said. Similar cases were filed by New York City, San Francisco, and Oakland, and were dismissed earlier this year by judges who ruled that the federal legislative or executive branches would have to pass a law that deals explicitly with this issue. Those cases are now on appeal. The lead attorney on those complaints, Steve Berman of Hagens Berman, said they were similar to the public-nuisance cases he won against Big Tobacco. \u201cNuisance law has been around for hundreds of years,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThis is just the latest, in my view, of the evolution of the law responding to new facts and new injuries created by mankind.\u201d If he wins one of his appeals, he points out, it is certain to go to the Supreme Court. Asked how he felt about that prospect, Berman said only, \u201cI don\u2019t like beer.\u201d In the latest twist, on October 24, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the nation\u2019s largest oil company, ExxonMobil, for hiding the financial risk that climate change posed to the company, and thus defrauding investors. Because of a powerful New York State securities law, many observers believe this case has a chance. Like the rest of the country, the courts are starting to feel the effects of climate change. May a sane and science-based policy take root there, and quickly.","headline":"Three Ways to Combat Climate Change Through the Courts","article_name":574315.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2018\/10\/three-ways-combat-climate-change-through-courts\/574315\/","date_published":"2018-10-30 10:00:00","article_length":10394,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:47.951849","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2018\/10\/three-ways-combat-climate-change-through-courts\/574315\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Biden\u2019s team is split on how to think about climate change. Every week, our lead climate reporter brings you the big ideas, expert analysis, and vital guidance that will help you flourish on a changing planet. Sign up to get T he Weekly Planet , our guide to living through climate change, in your inbox. The moderate Democratic president wanted the United States to tackle climate change, and he had pledged to get serious about it during the recent campaign. On the president\u2019s desk sat a memorandum laying out two options. One set of officials\u2014those who worked at the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency\u2014urged the president not to worry, for now, about how developing countries such as China and India acted. Most important for an issue as important and unwieldy as climate change, these advisers said, was that the U.S. be willing to slash its emissions alone, should it fail to wrangle international commitment first. But another team, composed of White House economists, insisted that climate change was essentially a global free-rider problem. Although all countries would benefit from American efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution, only the U.S. would pay for those efforts. The U.S. should avoid this outcome, they said, by conditioning its domestic climate policy on foreign action: If other countries didn\u2019t reduce their carbon emissions, then neither would America. Yes, President Bill Clinton faced a hard choice in 1997, about how the U.S. should handle the then-upcoming United Nations talks on climate change. Four administrations later, President Joe Biden, too, is weighing the relative power of climate diplomacy and unilateral U.S. action. This past weekend, negotiators from the U.S. and China\u2014including John Kerry, America\u2019s special climate envoy and former secretary of state\u2014 hammered out a brief statement committing to further climate action . And later this week, the Biden administration will announce the country\u2019s new emissions-reduction commitment under the Paris Agreement. Activists and environmental groups are pressuring Biden to commit to cutting U.S. climate pollution 50 percent by 2030 , as compared with its historic peak. This might be one of the most important weeks in U.S. climate policy this year. But note that I say \u201cmight be.\u201d  I\u2019m not convinced. In a prior administration, these announcements would have been major victories. This week, Biden will be lucky if they merely whelm. They feel not just unsurprising, but out of step with the rest of his climate policy. Why is that? A significant part, I would argue, is that the ideas underpinning this week\u2019s ceremony are simply outdated. Reading news of the China talks, I thought of a recent paper by the political scientists Micha\u00ebl Aklin and Matto Mildenberger . They argue that, since the 1990s, policy makers and academics have conceived of climate change in a mostly useless way. Officials have taken their cues from economists and imagined climate change as a free-rider problem, in which the goal is to prevent nations from taking advantage of one another. In fact, Aklin and Mildenberger say, climate change is a distributive-conflict problem \u2014a term that was new to me and that I will now explain. In essence, climate policy restructures the economy, creating new economic winners and losers. This is familiar enough: Coal mines suffer; electric utilities prosper. Because political leaders want, above all, to maintain the support of key constituencies, climate policy flows from a societal negotiation between potential winners and potential losers , a fight between climate reformers and climate obstructionists. The challenge of global climate action isn\u2019t that other people will benefit from your emissions cuts; it\u2019s that many interests actively oppose decarbonization. The key to passing climate policy is stitching together a coalition that will support and sustain decarbonization. Surveying the past few decades, they find that countries almost never care about free riding. \u201cGovernments implement climate policies regardless of what other countries do,\u201d they write, \u201cand they do so whether a climate treaty dealing with free-riding has been in place or not.\u201d The Trump presidency showed this effect at large, Mildenberger told me in an interview yesterday. When Donald Trump took the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, other nations did not react by withdrawing as well. Instead, revulsion at Trump himself\u2014and his climate views by proxy\u2014strengthened political support in those countries for continuing climate action. What\u2019s interesting is that both Aklin and Mildenberger\u2019s coalitional idea and the free-rider conception of climate action seem to operate within the Biden administration. The president\u2019s domestic-policy staff, epitomized by his adviser Brian Deese, is pursuing coalition-building climate policies, primarily characterized by public spending. The policies spread the economic gains of decarbonization around and increase the Biden coalition\u2019s support for further action. An older guard, epitomized by Kerry, hopes to secure other countries\u2019 involvement as well, in order to prevent free riding. You can see the roots of this disagreement in the Clinton memo nearly a quarter century ago. Whose theory is better? Neither seems necessarily awful to me. Kerry\u2019s approach actually fits within Deese\u2019s: Securing foreign climate commitments makes the task easier at home. But I do find the coalitional hypothesis a more useful guide to explaining the world. And the reason can be found, again, in U.S.-China climate relations. During the run-up to the Paris Agreement, in 2014, the two countries reached a joint agreement to cut their emissions. It was a huge deal. This agreement conveyed the seriousness of both countries; it showed that the world\u2019s two largest polluters wanted a good outcome from the Paris talks. But the announcement was more important for what it made possible politically . In the U.S., China\u2019s involvement allowed Barack Obama to fend off domestic arguments that climate policy would sacrifice American competitiveness with China; meanwhile, America\u2019s engagement with China as an equal increased the country\u2019s international position and shored up Chinese-elite support for climate action. Free riding wasn\u2019t really at issue here; the agreement\u2019s clearest advantage was that it made each country\u2019s domestic climate politics easier. Contrast that scene with now. The Biden administration has sold climate action as concretely in America\u2019s interests :  Its infrastructure package seeks to develop green industries not out of a sense of global do-goodism but because America\u2019s economic competitiveness is at stake. And Xi Jinping\u2019s government has, since last year, pursued aggressive climate policy as a way to build its international prestige. China uses climate policy to sell the orderliness and sanity of its system over the cacophonous and chaotic American approach. So the weekend\u2019s announcement seemed anticlimactic, to be honest. Of course the Biden administration and the Xi government now say they want further emissions reductions in the 2020s: Both governments are already acting domestically as if climate action is in their concrete interests. We would not be surprised\u2014it would not be newsy in the least\u2014if China and America said they both want to see more economic growth in the 2020s. Xi and Biden seem to understand decarbonization as a positive economic process; why would we be shocked that they both want more of it? As decarbonization progresses, I think more officials will naturally understand the climate challenge in the frame of coalition building, not free riding. The question for me is whether\u2014during this transition period\u2014the politics of free riding help or hinder Biden\u2019s attempt to forge a stronger pro-decarbonization coalition. If Biden commits to slashing greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, will that make the public pay more attention to\u2014and feel more skittish about\u2014the rest of his climate-policy playbook? Will nervousness about his policies kick in before the policies themselves pass Congress? I suppose we\u2019ll start to find out this week. Ping Shen sent this photo of a green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas , that he took while diving near the Kohala Coast, in Hawaii. He writes that the sea turtle was either female or juvenile, \u201cwhich is significant because sea turtles of all species have been seeing a rapid rise in the numbers of female births versus male.\u201d The temperature in which sea-turtle eggs are buried determines their sex \u2014and when water is above 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit, as it often is at the top of sea-turtle nests, the hatchlings are female. (Males tend to hatch from colder water at the bottom of nests.) \u201cWith a warming climate, well, you can imagine what happens in those nests\u2014 so the climate is someone else\u2019s weather, indeed, but for Chelonia  mydas , it\u2019s so much more ,\u201d he writes. Well put. Every week, I feature a weather or climate photo from a reader or professional in this part of the newsletter, because the climate is someone else\u2019s weather (and sometimes more than that). If you would like to submit one, please email weeklyplanet@theatlantic.com . Two observations about this thread. The first is that no American city has yet emerged as the center of the climate-tech industry in the same way that, say, San Francisco is the center of the software industry. Houston is a natural choice, given its history in the conventional-energy (that is, oil and gas) industry. But it had to slough off that industry\u2019s mistrust of environmentalism to lead. Arnold\u2019s thread suggests that is happening. Second, it seems like the decade-long divestment campaign is paying off. The Financial Times also reported this week on how American oil drillers are struggling to raise money from private-equity firms and are \u201cdying on the vine.\u201d Activists and green-minded investors have every incentive to make it look like divestment is changing what technologies and firms receive funding. But Arnold\u2019s report from the field and the FT story suggest that the strategy might actually be working. Thanks for reading.

{"id":null,"body":"The presidential debates are over and to the chagrin of earthly-minded individuals, the topic of global warming was roundly ignored by the moderators and both candidates. The presidential debates are over and to the chagrin of earthly-minded individuals, the topic of global warming was roundly ignored by the moderators and both candidates. The lack of discussion wasn't due to a sinister corporate plot, but the reality that no climate legislation is even remotely in the works in Congress, and few foresee it happening anytime soon. How come? As\u00a0 New York Times\u00a0 columnist David Brooks pointed out last week, the outlook wasn't always so grim: \"The period around 2003 was the golden spring of green technology. John McCain and Joe Lieberman introduced a bipartisan bill to curb global warming ...\u00a0You\u2019d go to Silicon Valley and all the venture capitalists, it seemed, were rushing into clean tech.\" Now, any sense of optimism is considered naive. So what killed climate change legislation? Republicans.\u00a0 It's impossible to start a checklist any other way than with the Republican Party, which has shifted its position on climate change dramatically in recent years away from government fixes aimed at curbing carbon emissions. This is most clearly visible by comparing the GOP platform in 2008 \u00a0[PDF] to the one in 2012 \u00a0[PDF]. It might seem surprising, but just four years ago, the GOP had a lengthy section on \"Addressing Climate Change Responsibly\": The same human economic activity that has\u00a0brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also\u00a0increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.\u00a0While the scope and longterm consequences of this\u00a0are the subject of ongoing\u00a0scientific research, common\u00a0sense dictates that the\u00a0United States should take\u00a0measured and reasonable\u00a0steps today to reduce any impact on the environment. Those steps, if consistent with our global competitiveness will also be good for our national security, our energy independence, and our economy. That platform came at a time when John McCain supported a cap-and-trade program as a presidential candidate and Republican Senator John Warner was co-sponsoring\u00a0a bill to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. But fast forward to 2012 and the aforementioned section is nowhere to be seen on the platform language. Gone. Erased. In its place is a platform that opposes \"any and all cap and trade legislation\u201d and urges Congress to\u00a0\u201ctake quick action to prohibit the EPA from moving forward with new greenhouse gas regulations.\u201d So there you have it, in the span of four years, a transition from tepid openness to united resistance, which created an environment where only a\u00a0filibuster-proof majority could break the partisan gridlock. Al Gore\u00a0 Then you might ask, why did Republicans sour on the idea of climate legislation? In his column, David Brooks offered an answer that some have accepted but many find unjustifiable: Al Gore made the issue of climate change politically toxic with the release of his 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth . Per Brooks: The global warming issue became associated with the highly partisan former vice president. Gore mobilized liberals, but, once he became the global warming spokesman, no Republican could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and survive. Any slim chance of building a bipartisan national consensus was gone. In response to Brooks's theory,\u00a0 The Washington Post's\u00a0 Ezra Klein doesn't find it necessarily wrong, but finds Brooks's lack of condemnation of the GOP \"astonishing.\" \"This isn\u2019t a story of overreach, misjudgements, and disappointment,\" he writes. \"It\u2019s a story of Republicans putting raw partisanship and a dislike for Al Gore in front of the planet\u2019s best interests.\" But surely, others soured the mood as well. Industry-funded research. One contributor to the shifting mood on climate change is the rise of climate skeptics who contend that the burning of fossil fuels is not causing climate change. Many climate skeptics have become targets of green groups who've pointed out funding ties to entities such as the Koch brothers, whose subsidiaries own refineries, oil pipelines, and coal and cement transportation systems . Writing for Yale, Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway have a lengthy analysis of this movement led by think tanks such as the CATO Institute and American Enterprise Institute. \"In the case of global warming, there is strong evidence that this contrarian campaign is enjoying success, with recent polls showing that more than half of Americans are not particularly worried about the issue and that fully 40 percent believe there is major disagreement among scientists about whether climate change is even occurring,\" they write. \"This confusion is no doubt due, at least in part, to the persistent campaigns of obfuscation by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and other global warming deniers who use right-wing talk radio, the Internet, and television programs such as Fox News to propagate their message of doubt.\" Barack Obama. It's easy to forget that early on in his first term, President Obama enjoyed a filibuster-proof majority in Congress. Why didn't he move to pass climate legislation? As a candidate, he told voters during his second debate with John McCain that energy policy would be his first priority when entering office, ahead of health care. \"That would be priority number one.\u00a0Health care is priority number two,\" he told NBC's Tom Brokaw. In his first term, however, he exhausted his political capital in his effort to pass health care reform, which coincided with the ascendance of\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0Sen. Scott Brown taking over Ted Kennedy's Senate seat and breaking the filibuster-proof majority. Now, Obama was able to set aside $90 billion for renewable energy loans and grants, but while the program has had some successes, blots like Solyndra have further damaged the cause of bringing Republicans on board to the issue. Of course, Republicans are in the party that has steadfastly opposed climate legislation, so there's where your complaints can begin.","headline":"What Killed Climate Change Legislation?","article_name":322188.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2012\/10\/what-killed-climate-change-legislation\/322188\/","date_published":"2012-10-23 21:37:40","article_length":6039,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:48.970133","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2012\/10\/what-killed-climate-change-legislation\/322188\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The pressing importance of figuring out how rising temperatures will affect people and places around the world When Hurricane Sandy pummeled the east coast of the U.S. and the Caribbean in October 2012 it exposed millions of people and billions of dollars worth of economic assets to the sorts of hazards that might be expected to increase as a result of climate change. An estimated 1.8 million structures and homes were destroyed or damaged, with economic losses exceeding\u00a0 $65 billion. Among the businesses most negatively affected by Sandy were tourism (losses of more than\u00a0 $1 billion and 10,000 jobs ) and small- and medium-scale manufacturing and storage. Retailers, such as clothing firm\u00a0 Eileen Fisher , lost inventory when Sandy flooded warehouses and disrupted supply chains. \u00a0 There were a few bright spots: Building-supply stores like Home Depot saw sales shoot up in locations affected by the storm. In the three months after the storm, the company attributed $242 million in sales to the event as residents and businesses pieced back together their former homes and livelihoods. But sales of material and lumber aside, Sandy's bill was huge. Likewise Katrina, following which\u00a0 $40 billion \u00a0in claims were filed, an amount equivalent to almost half of worldwide catastrophic claims made in 2005. And we know from Katrina that it can take years to recover: According to the U.S. Census, eight years later New Orlean's population was only 72 percent of its pre-storm level. Events like these show how climate change, which will result in more severe storms, will have a huge and varied global economic impact, and that the impacts will hit locally and ripple out by affecting supply chains, consumer behaviors, regional economies, and downstream jobs. Yet the scientists who met in Japan recently to finalize the much-anticipated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on climate impacts and vulnerabilities called such economic estimates as \u201cdifficult\u201d to make. The closest they came to an overall number was to say that aggregate losses across the world economy have a more than 50 percent chance of being greater than 2 percent of global GDP. They also noted that for most economic sectors, the impacts of climate change would be smaller than the impacts of population and technology change. For most people, what matters are not the global economic impacts, but the effects on the places they live and work. The IPCC report spends a lot of time on how climate will affect agriculture and natural resources. Although, worldwide, as much as one-third of all those employed work in agriculture , this share is decreasing and the agricultural sector contributes about three percent to the overall value of the global economy .\u00a0 The report says relatively little about the impacts on sectors that now drive economic development and are the major sources of employment: the chemical, textile, electronics, and automobile industries; retail, health services, and real estate. This is a problem, not only for the relevance of IPCC, but for the research community in general. We look to assessments such as the IPCC's to translate the science for government leaders, and more importantly to increase public awareness of the potential consequences of climate change, not just in the abstract but how it will affect their own jobs and wallets. These reports have far-reaching repercussions. If the panel has little to say or is uncertain about how climate change will impact the important parts of our economies, then everyone is less likely to take the reports seriously. So why did the panel have so little to say about the economic consequences of climate change? First, because there is actually very little published, peer-reviewed science on the risks that climate poses to the economy. What data we do have comes from company reports and studies by consultants that do not go through scientific peer review. The last time the panel relied on studies that were less than ironclad, they\u00a0 got burned by the media . You might remember the\u00a0 field day \u00a0climate-change deniers had in 2007 when the report cited documents about rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers and forecasts of steep declines in African crop yields though they had not been peer reviewed for scientific accuracy. Some IPCC scientists, including our colleagues Malcolm Hughes and Mike Mann, were sued to obtain access to emails relating to the report. This time around, the scientists were understandably nervous about citing anything not peer-reviewed, especially reports from industry or environmental groups. That put the panel in a bind. This is not surprising given that the distribution of funding for climate change research is lopsided, favoring physical science rather than social science. The National Science Foundation's Social and Behavioral Science program is the primary source of federally funded basic research in the social sciences, and its whole budget for all social science\u2014not just climate\u2014is one-tenth of the\u00a0 U.S. Global Change Program , which was $2.6 billion in 2013. What this means is that while we\u00a0have\u00a0a robust NASA satellite program, we have very little basic social-science research being done on the how climate change will impact the economy. Still, we are not without data or analytical resources. The best climate cost estimates we have come from the private sector: industry-funded research centers like the American Petroleum Institute. Businesses and industry have both the most at stake and the most to gain from knowing precisely what will happen, given that their assets are exposed to unanticipated climate events. They need to forecast losses and put recovery plans in place.\u00a0 For example, a report from the\u00a0 Carbon Disclosure Project \u00a0reported on a survey of more than 2,000 companies and found that 44 percent of them had suffered a disruption in production from rainfall or drought and 31 percent had experienced higher production costs. A new report from the\u00a0 Partnership for Resilience and Environmental Preparedness \u00a0provides detailed guidelines on how companies might assess the resilience of their supply chains to climate disruptions, and gives examples of how Levi Strauss and Starbucks have managed climate risks by helping their suppliers reduce water use in cotton or adapt coffee production to warmer temperatures. Some of the most detailed data comes from global insurers. A case in point, the Thai floods of 2011 inundated the automobile and electronics manufacturing facilities that had been built on former rice paddies in the floodplain of the Chao Praya River, near Bangkok, and caused losses estimated at more than $45 billion, reducing Thai economic growth and seriously affecting the profits of companies such as Sony and Honda. Toyota reported losses of almost one quarter million automobiles and suspended production lines across Southeast Asia and North America. Because of the concentration of computer hard-disk manufacturing in the flooded industrial parks, prices of desk and laptop hard drives doubled worldwide. There were several studies comparing the flood's impacts on different sectors and companies. The reinsurer\u00a0 Swiss Re \u00a0advertises a proprietary web tool which maps environmental vulnerability to earthquakes, floods and climate events on its home page. Users can tailor their investigation down to their countries cities, infrastructure, and economic assets. Even though corporations frequently withhold specific data on operations, strategy, and performance for reasons of competitive advantage, there are many businesses interested enough in climate risks to provide information to researchers and analysts skilled enough to undertake studies. More importantly, businesses belong to associations, which regularly conduct impact reviews of such topics as trade, regulatory change, and workforce development. By aggregating research findings across firms in an industry, this type of information is used to conduct strategic assessments of likely consequences of threats and opportunities. Scholars and business analysts regularly retrieve data from firms, process it to obscure sensitive information and then publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. These authors have an enormous incentive to be accurate, and their work should serve as a baseline from which more scientific estimates of economic impact can be made. It should become common practice for scientists to convert and expand such studies into robust peer-reviewed analysis that can be used by climate assessments. The research community needs to be much better prepared for future assessments, publishing high-quality studies on climate and the economy well in advance of deadlines for IPCC and other reports. But this means that there needs to be collaboration with the private sector to collect good data, and that research funding needs to be balanced. In the U.S. we have spent several decades and billions of dollars observing and modeling the earth and analyzing climate risks to water and ecology, compared to a few million a year for socioeconomic impact studies. The economic impacts won't necessarily always be negative or large\u2014that's why we need research to examine which sectors, firms, workers and regions will benefit or lose from what type of climate changes. The science community has been ignoring this research at their peril\u2014and at the planet's peril: money talks. Science needs to talk to the money.","headline":"What Are the Economic Consequences of Climate Change?","article_name":360995.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-economic-case-for-acting-on-climate-change\/360995\/","date_published":"2014-04-22 14:41:42","article_length":9466,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:49.406913","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/04\/the-economic-case-for-acting-on-climate-change\/360995\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"I've been kicking around an idea recently that crystallized in the form of a short \"Room for Debate\" op-ed on green jobs that I wrote for The New York Times yesterday. Here's the relevant snip: The nugget of the argument here is the framing fighting climate change as a way to help nature is flawed. Even in a really clear example of climate-induced ecological change -- the loss of many species in the forests Thoreau explored near Walden Pond -- other species are doing just fine. We're changing the ecosystem, but life isn't leaving the forest. We're applying a very certain kind of filter on the forest (specifically, which plants can change their flowering time quickly) but life there survives because ecosystems, even those stressed by rising temperatures, are resilient. Human-built environments, on the other hand, are very efficient and very brittle. They function best in a very narrow set of temperature and precipitation conditions. Witness what happens when it snows in Portland or it gets very hot in a cold place or it rains somewhere where it's always dry. A people as rich as Americans can deal with any climate, but only if we put the right infrastructure in place. People in Buffalo have snow plows. People in Phoenix have air conditioners. Now start fiddling with the climate of the place. Most of the time things are fine, but when you hit an extreme that you don't normally (floods, snow, heat, etc), stuff starts to go haywire. The infrastructure you built is encountering conditions it wasn't designed to withstand. And so it breaks. (See a similar argument I made specific to cities in 2010.) Somehow polar bears became the charismatic emblem of what was wrong with global warming; I think we should have made it a mayor instead.","headline":"Fighting Climate Change Is Not About Environmentalism","article_name":245483.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2011\/09\/fighting-climate-change-is-not-about-environmentalism\/245483\/","date_published":"2011-09-21 21:38:25","article_length":1755,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:50.025744","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2011\/09\/fighting-climate-change-is-not-about-environmentalism\/245483\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"He won\u2019t be the last. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking back to something that John Kerry told The Atlantic \u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, earlier this year. Asked about the importance of the Middle East to the United States, Kerry answered entirely about the Islamic State. \u201cImagine what would happen if we don\u2019t stand and fight [ISIS],\u201d he said: If we didn\u2019t do that, you could have allies and friends of ours fall. You could have a massive migration into Europe that destroys Europe, leads to the pure destruction of Europe, ends the European project, and everyone runs for cover and you\u2019ve got the 1930s all over again, with nationalism and fascism and other things breaking out. Of course we have an interest in this, a huge interest in this. The 1930s all over again\u2014Kerry was laying out a prediction in April, but it sounds a little more like description now. Even if America\u2019s current dunderheaded demagogue loses the presidential election, the European project already falters in the United Kingdom, and Russia rumbles with revanchism. Fueled now (as then) by an ailing global economy, far-right nationalism seems ascendant worldwide . It\u2019s hard not to think of the 1930s as the catastrophe which presaged our contemporary tragicomedy. I write and report on climate change, not a pursuit that usually encourages optimism, but watching all this unfold with the atmosphere in mind has been particularly bleak. For the past few months in particular, I\u2019ve been thinking: Wow, this is all happening way earlier than I thought it would. Spend enough time with some of the worst-case climate scenarios, and you may start to assume, as I did, that a major demagogue would contest the presidency in the next century. I figured that the catastrophic consequences of planetary warming would all but ensure the necessary conditions for such a leader, and I imagined their support coming from a movement motivated by ethnonationalism, economic stagnation, and hatred of immigrants and refugees. I pictured, in other words, something not so far from Trump 2016. I just assumed it wouldn\u2019t pop up until 2040. This kind of worry is speculative\u2014 very speculative\u2014but it is not ungrounded. A large body of scholarship suggests that climate change could exert grave effects on international politics this century. Planet-wide warming will dry out regions of the world already riven with ethnic and political strife, all the while impoverishing and destabilizing the Western powers that backstop global order. A recent study even argues that climate-triggered environmental shocks will exacerbate the very divisions that authoritarians have historically sought to exploit. So to now watch a demagogue contest the presidency, running a campaign that appeals to racism and xenophobia, has felt less like the sudden apparition of an unfathomable nightmare and more like the early realization of a seasonal forecast. You can hear the long-predicted gusts, the rain pounding on the roof and the groaning thunder. It\u2019s all just happening four decades earlier than the weather person said. So I want to propose a new way of understanding Donald Trump. He not only represents a white racial backlash , and he has not only opened the way for an American extension of the European far right . Insofar as his supporters are drawn to him by a sense of global calamity, and insofar as his rhetoric singles out the refugee as yet another black and brown intruder trying to violate the nation\u2019s cherished borders, Trump is the first demagogue of the Anthropocene. We should take Trump at his word when he calls Syrian refugees \u201cone of the great Trojan horses,\u201d or when his son bizarrely describes them as Skittles that \u201cwill kill you.\u201d In Europe, Trump\u2019s far-right kin have long blurred the differences between legal immigration, Islamist terrorism, and the refugees fleeting the Syrian War. After the Paris attacks last year, one leader of the French far-right National Front said , \u201cToday, we can see that immigration has become favorable terrain for the development of Islamism.\u201d This xenophobia is grounded in real-life trends. I will focus on two in particular: moribund economic growth and the mass migration of non-white people. Both will likely intensify as the planet warms. (A third vital trend\u2014 the political and cultural upheaval of the U.S. racial hierarchy \u2014will not vary with climate change.) First, climate change could easily worsen the inequality that has already hollowed out the Western middle class. A recent analysis in Nature projected that the effects of climate change will reduce the average person\u2019s income by 23 percent by the end of the century. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicts that unmitigated global warming could cost the American economy $200 billion this century . (Some climate researchers think the EPA undercounts these estimates .) Future consumers will not register these costs so cleanly, though\u2014there will not be a single climate-change debit exacted on everyone\u2019s budgets at year\u2019s end. Instead, the costs will seep in through many sources: storm damage, higher power rates, real-estate depreciation, unreliable and expensive food. Climate change could get laundered, in other words, becoming just one more symptom of a stagnant and unequal economy. As quality of life declines, and insurance premiums rise, people could feel that they\u2019re being robbed by an aloof elite. They won\u2019t even be wrong. It\u2019s just that due to the chemistry of climate change, many members of that elite will have died 30 or 50 years prior. Yet the second trend\u2014the combination of mass migration and racist backlash\u2014could push even more polities toward authoritarianism. Migration is also harder to predict than inequality: Wars and exoduses are not as easy to model as flood damage and agricultural yields. But academics are trying. J\u00fcrgen Scheffran, a professor of geography at the University of Hamburg, has been investigating whether climate change makes armed conflict more likely for more than a decade. In 2012, he worked on a team that analyzed all 27 empirical studies investigating the link between war and climate change. \u201cSixteen found a significant link between climate and conflict, six did not find a link, and five found an ambiguous relationship,\u201d he told me. He described these numbers as inconclusive. Trying to prove that climate change is linked to war, he said, would be like trying to prove that smoking causes cancer with only one available case study. \u201cThat alone was complicated to prove over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were millions of cases of individuals who were smoking, and millions who got cancer, and you can develop a correlation between these two phenomena.\u201d \u201cBut there is only one world, and not a million worlds, in which the temperature is rising, and you cannot associate a single event\u2014like a single hurricane or a single conflict\u2014to climate change. It\u2019s a statistical problem, and we don\u2019t have enough data yet,\u201d he said. He sketched the basic dispute in the field: One set of researchers, whose most prominent advocates work at the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, contend that there is not a meaningful link between conflict and climate change. Another school of thought, which centers around researchers in the Bay Area, say that warming is already driving conflicts worldwide. Partly it depends on whom you ask. Malin Mobj\u00f6rk, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, recently described a \u201cgrowing consensus\u201d in the literature that climate change can raise the risk of violence. And the U.S. Department of Defense already considers global warming a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d for national security. It expects hotter temperatures and acidified oceans to destabilize governments and worsen infectious pandemics. Indeed, climate change may already be driving mass migrations. Last year, the Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley was mocked for suggesting that a climate-change-intensified drought in the Levant\u2014 the worst drought in 900 years \u2014helped incite the Syrian Civil War, thus kickstarting the Islamic State. The evidence tentatively supports him . Since the outbreak of the conflict, some scholars have recognized that this drought pushed once-prosperous farmers into Syria\u2019s cities . Many became unemployed and destitute, aggravating internal divisions in the run-up to the war. Scheffran underlined these climate connections but declined to emphasize them. \u201cThe Syrian War has so many complex interrelated issues\u2014and most of them are political and economic\u2014that the drought is just one contributing factor to the instability in the region,\u201d he said. This basic disagreement is what makes Carl-Friedrich Schleussner\u2019s research so compelling. Schleussner, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, trained as a climate scientist. When he started studying armed conflict, he was surprised to see that many studies focused on changing rainfall or gradual temperature increases. \u201cWhat we found surprising about this debate was people were purely focusing on temperature indices or precipitation indices,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn our analysis, it\u2019s all about the exogenous shock. We were all interested in, to what extent does a big event like a flooding or a drought undermine society, or trigger a conflict outbreak?\u201d He and his colleagues suspected that most people can adjust over time to slower changes in their local environment. What they wanted to know what whether conflict could be stirred by a flood, drought, or wildfire\u2014a sudden act of god that destroys deep wealth with little warning. To get at these questions, they avoided using a meteorological database at all. Instead, they opted for an index of the economic damage wrought by natural disasters. They used, in fact, one of the largest databases of this type: the natural-disaster-cost data assembled by Munich Re , a enormous global reinsurance company. (Reinsurance firms sell insurance to consumer insurance companies, and therefore must monitor the changing costs of natural disasters.) Munich Re\u2019s tally encompasses over 18,000 \u201cclimate-related events\u201d between 1980 and 2010. Schleussner and his colleagues were the first to use it in climate research. They were not disappointed. Heatwaves, droughts, and other climate-related exogenous shocks do correlate to conflict outbreak\u2014but only in countries primed for conflict by ethnic division. In the 30-year period, nearly a quarter of all ethnic-fueled armed conflict coincided with a climate-related calamity. By contrast, in the set of all countries, war only correlated to climatic disaster about 9 percent of the time. \u201cWe cannot find any evidence for a generalizable trigger relationship, but we do find evidence for some risk enhancement,\u201d Schleussner told me. In other words, \u00a0climate disaster will not cause a war, but it can influence whether one begins. Schleussner demurred when I asked him to think through some scenarios. Right now, his conclusions don\u2019t suggest how climatic disasters become armed conflict. He also does not believe that every ethnically divided country will crack up as the planet warms. \u201cOut of the 50 countries that can be classified as ethnically factionalized, there\u2019s also Canada. And Canada is not that conflict-prone, apart from hockey, right?\u201d he said. But his paper does detail particular areas of concern\u2014and both of them border Europe. Models predict that northern Africa and the Levant, both already drought-prone, will dry out significantly over the course of the century. On the phone, Schleussner also cited southern Africa and south-central Asia as regions to watch. (It\u2019s no coincidence that some of the largest , longest wars this century have occurred in those places.) Schleussner and his colleagues also allude to a nightmare scenario in the paper itself, though they couch it in clinical language: \u201cFurther destabilization of Northern Africa and the Levant may have widespread effects by triggering migration flows to neighboring countries and remote migrant destinations such as the European Union.\u201d In other words, a drought-and-flood-fueled armed conflict near the Mediterranean Basin could send people toward Western Europe in the hundreds of millions. This is the \u201c1930s all over again\u201d scenario that Kerry mentioned, the one playing out in miniature right now, made all the worse through the aggravation of a climate-changed world. Never mind armed conflict. Could disastrous environmental upheaval produce mass migration all by itself? The consensus here is more muddied. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to predict anything about migration, generally speaking,\u201d says Cristina Bradatan, a professor of sociology at Texas Tech University who studies, well, migration. \u201cAnd when we talk about climate-change migration, that is forced migration\u2014which is the worst situation from the point of view of projection. So if there is a consensus, it\u2019s that it\u2019s very difficult to know what will happen.\u201d She also resisted commenting on the nightmare scenario. \u201cIn Europe, there is all this fear that there will be a huge mass migration from Africa due to environmental changes,\u201d she said. The literature makes that seem unlikely: Most poor people have neither the means nor the international connections needed to actually flee a country, she said. So if their homes become untenable, they instead move to the nearest safe place\u2014which is often the nearest city. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that there would be a mass migration to Europe, but I would expect to see a large number of people being displaced within Africa,\u201d she said. No matter what, any international mass migration will produce systemic strain. If people do cross a national border while seeking refuge, existing international law will not have a mechanism to understand them. \u201cWhen I would teach my students this, I would say: There is literally, in legal parlance, no such thing as an environmental refugee,\u201d says Edward Carr. \u201cTo meet the international standard for refugee, a changing environment is not a forcing. It doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Carr is a professor of international development and the environment at Clark University, and he sits on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He believes governments must focus on reducing the risk of migration crises in the first place, partly because defining and creating a safety net for environmental refugees will prove so difficult. \u201cThe reason this is a problem, and so challenging to deal with politically, is that this is what they call the slow-onset disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cRarely will we see situations where a place just goes bone-dry for 10 years, and everyone has to move or die. That\u2019s not the scenario.\u201d He went on. \u201cAs I used to pose to [students]: When would you attribute the decision to move to changes in the climate? Does a place have to be dry for five years? For 10 years? Does someone have to have three children die, and then they decide to move? There\u2019s no line for this.\u201d Climate change could push Western politics toward demagoguery and authoritarianism in two ways, then. First, it could devastate agricultural yields and raise food prices; destroy coastal real estate and wash away family wealth; transform old commodities into luxury goods . Second, it could create a wave of migration\u2014likely from conflict, but possibly from environmental ruination\u2014that stresses international reception systems and risks fomenting regional resource disputes. In effect, it could erode people\u2019s sense of security, pushing them toward authoritarianism. If this model of authoritarian response seems simplistic, that\u2019s because it is. Economic strife and mass migration have produced far-right authoritarianism in the past, so I assume they could in the future. Empirically speaking, financial crises especially seem to cause a flight to the extremes . But they do not guarantee anything, and I\u2019ve focused on the questions of contributors\u2014mass migration and conflict\u2014because they are easier to predict than politics. Yet in doing so I\u2019ve committed the trend-tracker\u2019s fallacy. Like the CEO in the 1950s who predicted that America would see flying cars and three-day workweeks by the year 1999, I\u2019ve assumed that every ongoing trend line can be extrapolated out indefinitely. They can\u2019t. The actual future will be far stranger. Yet history will still be constrained by demography, ideology, and atmospheric chemistry. \u201cThere are certainly plenty of viable scenarios where people could move into places and you get an ethnonationalist backlash. We\u2019re seeing it!\u201d Carr said at one point. \u201cSo clearly it could happen again. And I absolutely am convinced that, in the long run, the effects of climate change will be problematic and destabilizing for many of us in many places.\u201d Trump is, in essence, a double case\u2014a preview of what\u2019s to come and a way to practice dealing with it. He represents a test that the leaders of a major American political party are failing, and that the electorate may only narrowly pass. He is showing us how ill-prepared the United States is for post-climate demagoguery, and he gives us an opportunity to improve our societal immune response. How might we do that? His rise also suggests a number of defense mechanisms. Obviously, the first is that climate change must be mitigated with all deliberate speed. But he also suggests certain cultural mechanisms. Some Americans may favor more restrictive immigration policies , but\u2014in order to withstand against future waves of mass migration (and humanely deal with the victims of climate change)\u2014racist fears must be unhooked from immigration restrictionism . In other words, as a matter of survival against future authoritarians, white supremacy must be rejected and defeated. And there is a third method of fighting back against Trump and his ilk. Carr doesn\u2019t think it makes sense to improve the response in receiving countries; I am less convinced. After all, he also told me that reception to migrants in the U.S. depends greatly on regional cultures. Central Massachusetts, where he lives now, welcomed about 10,000 Ghanian refugees in the 1970s , and it never entered a period of mass white-nationalist revulsion. The United States still welcomes and integrates immigrants faster than European countries. Those regional cultures can still be improved and strengthened. In April, a poll conducted by The Atlantic and the Public Religion Research Institute found that the voters most likely to vote for Donald Trump were civically disengaged \u2014they did not go to church, or volunteer at school or Girl Scouts, or join a book club. These Americans were also more likely to be financially insecure and less likely to be well educated. When journalists write about how you can avert the worst of climate change , they focus primarily on technological means. The environmentally anxious are encouraged to give up industrial beef, to buy carbon credits, to install rooftop solar panels. An entrepreneurial neighborhood might be told to build community solar . A well-off consumer might be asked to splurge on an electric car. The only social or political act that most of these explainers will propose is this: You should vote for candidates who understand climate science and who will act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (In the United States, and in no other developed country, that only describes the candidates of one major political party.) It makes sense to put voting \u00a0in that list because, really, all those technological actions resemble voting\u2014they are all essentially just types of harm reduction. At worst, skipping beef or buying carbon credits is an ethically valuable but economically worthless gesture; at best, it modestly helps avoid a much worse outcome. But Trump\u2019s success in the primary among the civically disintegrated suggests another way forward. Improving the United States\u2019s immune response to authoritarian leadership\u2014a response that could be repeatedly tested in the century to come\u2014can follow from weaving its civic fabric ever tighter. I don\u2019t know what this will look like, exactly, for every person. But here are some places to start: Volunteer. Run for local or state office. Give to charity (whether due to religion or effective altruism). Organize at work. Join a church or a community choir or the local library staff. Make your hometown a better place for refugees to settle. Raise a child well. These may seem inconsequential, tasks unrelated to the final goal of restricting how much carbon dioxide enters the environment. And, admittedly, they are. But climate realists have always split their work between mitigation\u2014that is, trying to keep the climate from getting worse\u2014and adaptation\u2014trying to protect what we already have. As more warming gets baked into the biosphere, as seas rise and livelihoods fall, these prosaic steps will become vital forms of adaptation. Climate mitigation is a worthy goal in itself. It is all the more important when understood as one more type of long-term anti-fascism.","headline":"Donald Trump Is the First Demagogue of the Anthropocene","article_name":504134.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/10\/trump-the-first-demagogue-of-the-anthropocene\/504134\/","date_published":"2016-10-19 14:44:13","article_length":21009,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:50.472848","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/10\/trump-the-first-demagogue-of-the-anthropocene\/504134\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"With a new global summit approaching, communities in the southern United States are calling attention to the disaster scenarios they currently face. In the new global reality, where each passing year is the hottest on record, the final month of summer foretells calamity. It\u2019s always hot and volatile in the dog days between mid-August and mid-September, but the past few years have dialed those elements up high. Heat waves, droughts, storms, floods, and other extreme events have garnered increasing attention. The largest wildfire in California\u2019s history is now raging almost a year after the previous record holder hit the state. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma ravaged the Gulf Coast and Florida in late August last year. Hurricane Maria became the second-most deadly natural disaster in contemporary American history when it passed over Puerto Rico last September. And the 13th anniversary of the Louisiana landfall of Hurricane Katrina, the largest such storm, is on August 29. Climate change is not a future problem. Climate change is a current problem. Yet the United States\u2014despite this recent history\u2014has pulled back from a number of already insufficient commitments to reversing emissions and global warming. Faced with this vacuum, American nongovernmental organizations and states have stepped forward with campaigns designed to reinvigorate climate activism and policy making. But they have a long way to go, especially in connecting a mainstream climate movement with the majority of the victims of those disasters. One of the major initiatives put together as President Donald Trump began to withdraw the White House from climate leadership is the Global Climate Action Summit, which will take place in September. \u201cThis summit\u2019s happening in San Francisco, California, but it\u2019s something that was requested several years ago by the United Nations,\u201d says Nick Nuttall, the summit\u2019s spokesman. A collective of non-state actors organized the event, Nuttall says, with the goal of \u201cbring[ing] together leaders from state and local governments, business, and citizens from around the world to demonstrate how the tide has turned in the race against climate change.\u201d As Nuttall told me, the general idea is to recapture the energy that preceded the 2015 Paris climate agreement, in which most of the world\u2019s countries agreed to pursue policies that would curb global temperature growth to well under 2 degrees Celsius. * Why the wildfires of 2018 have been so ferocious However, the problem with many climate summits\u2014and much of the mainstream climate movement, generally\u2014is that many of them focus on a future target, planning for and attempting to avert doomsday scenarios that might play out over the course of decades or a century. The mainstream paradigm often views climate change as a collective risk, and pushes people to action by selling fears of future societal collapse and environmental ruin. Both can be averted if politicians and people work together and with urgency, the common argument goes; if we all pitch in, we can avoid the worst. As the fallout from Harvey, Irma, and Maria shows, though, that argument is false. The suffering caused by a warming and more temperamental environment is already happening, and it isn\u2019t distributed equally, nor will it be. From the poor people in Vieques , Puerto Rico, who still face uncertain medical care and unstable electricity after Maria, to black and Latino communities severed from dialysis services in Houston during Harvey, if there\u2019s anything the current climate regime tells us, it\u2019s that vulnerable populations are already in trouble. But as the anniversaries of America\u2019s most infamous climate disasters come around once again, there are real efforts by a loose network of veteran environmental-justice leaders and groups across the country to spread the gospel of climate justice in this moment of crisis. More than a dozen local environmental groups from coast to coast have organized the Freedom to Breathe Tour, where journalists, activists, and environmental-justice experts will present vulnerable communities with their case for swift and dramatic action on climate change. The 21-day tour, which begins August 25 and will traverse the entirety of the American South and Southwest, will illustrate the current climate realities for communities of color in the nation\u2019s most marginalized places. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the science is inaccessible,\u201d says Caroline Lewis, the founder of the CLEO Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on climate literacy and education in South Florida. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is simplify climate science for the general population.\u201d During the tour\u2019s stop in Miami, Lewis and her organization will run a workshop that uses well-known concepts like sea-level rise and gentrification as what she called \u201cgateway drugs\u201d to a full understanding of climate change. In and around Miami especially, those costs are readily apparent. The city is facing the imminent threats of inundation , as well as the potential for climate-based gentrification , in which wealthier and typically whiter residents scramble for the few patches of high ground. The rising heat creates health problems, too, especially in many poorer communities that rely on window units and fans for air conditioning. Florida is expected to have several cities face more than 100 days of dangerous heat indices by 2050. And Miami\u2019s cocktail of humidity and heat is on the verge of creating real danger . \u201cWe are one bad summer away from reading about heat fatalities in Miami,\u201d Lewis told me. Communities and activists see the road trip\u2014along the 3,000 miles between Miami and San Francisco\u2014as an opportunity to showcase ongoing disasters ahead of next year\u2019s UN climate meeting. In Lake Apopka, Florida, members of the Farmworker Association of Florida are mobilizing after a recent study indicated that the virtually all-Latino population of farmworkers in the area faces regular heat-related illnesses \u2014and that\u2019s in addition to regular exposure to pesticides. In \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d a swath of Louisiana between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, residents burdened with higher-than-average rates of cancer have sought protections against the petrochemical industry that dominates the region. And in New Orleans, 13 years after Hurricane Katrina, black and brown residents still live in profound environmental insecurity, facing continued displacement, pollution, and flooding. In Houston, another stop on the tour, both ends of the climate-degradation loop are on display. Harvey revealed just how dangerous the petrochemical industry can be, with multiple hazardous-waste leaks in vulnerable neighborhoods and explosions in a peroxide-production plant near the city . But that danger might\u2019ve stayed muted if not for the storm, whose intensity was likely amplified by the use of petrochemicals. Can Puerto Rico recover from Maria before the next storm hits? \u201cWith Harvey in Houston, there\u2019s the big picture,\u201d says Priscilla Villa, an organizer with the environmental advocacy group Earthworks. \u201cHouston is seen as this epicenter for oil and gas. The [industry] headquarters are based there. But there\u2019s also a lot of industrial facilities that exist, predominantly on the east side near communities of color.\u201d Oil-and-gas extraction and the refinement process are well known to be sources of pollution, and the use of oil and gas is well known to drive climate change. According to Villa, the vulnerabilities of communities to the pollution and their vulnerabilities to a changing climate are inseparable. Continuing on across desert and mountains and into the rich hinterland of California, the communities on the tour are increasingly vocal\u2014perhaps even desperate. For them, the points of no return aren\u2019t 2 degrees away in the future, but could be reached within the span of a few years. Farmworkers in western Texas face the dual pressures of hostile immigration enforcement and hotter and more dangerous working conditions. Small minority-owned farms in New Mexico seek a new model to compete in a warming state.Throughout the tour\u2019s span, displacement is already widespread, migrant farmworkers have already found themselves fleeing heat and droughts, and the space and social boundaries of cities that were already built under the constraints of Jim Crow are under stress from natural disasters and heat. Events like the Global Climate Action Summit are kicking off a post-American era of climate leadership, with the understanding that if humans wait too long to do something meaningful about the Earth\u2019s warming, catastrophe is surely ahead. But even more sure is that there are plenty of catastrophes brewing in forgotten places today. * This article originally stated that the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2016, and misstated its target to be exactly 2 degrees Celsius. We regret the errors.","headline":"The Victims of Climate Change Are Already Here","article_name":568069.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2018\/08\/climate-change-global-climate-action-summit\/568069\/","date_published":"2018-08-22 10:00:00","article_length":8882,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:51.426197","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2018\/08\/climate-change-global-climate-action-summit\/568069\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"Local emissions over the subcontinent make summer storms more erratic, and may have global consequences. Over the next decade, more than 400 large dams will be built on the Himalayan rivers\u2014by India, China, Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan\u2014to feed the region\u2019s hunger for electricity and its need for irrigation. New ports and thermal power plants line the coastal arc that runs from India, through Southeast Asia, to China. India and China have embarked on schemes to divert rivers to bring water to their driest lands: Costing tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, they are the largest and most expensive construction projects the world has ever seen. At stake in how these plans unfold is the welfare of a significant portion of humanity. At stake is the future shape of Asia, the relations among its nations. The Indian subcontinent is the crucible of the monsoon. In its simplest definition, the monsoon is \u201ca seasonal prevailing wind.\u201d There are other monsoons, in northern Australia and in North America; none is as pronounced, as marked in its reversal between wet and dry seasons, as the South Asian monsoon. More than 70 percent of total rainfall in South Asia occurs during just three months each year, between June and September. Even within that period, rainfall is not consistent: It is compressed into just 100 hours of torrential rain across the summer months. Despite a vast expansion in irrigation since 1947, 60 percent of Indian agriculture remains rain-fed, and agriculture employs about half of India\u2019s population. Unlike China, unlike most large countries in the world, India\u2019s population will continue to be predominantly rural until the mid-21st century. No comparably large number of human beings anywhere in the world is so dependent on such intensely seasonal rainfall. In the first decade of the 20th century, the finance minister in the imperial government declared that \u201cevery budget is a gamble on the rains\u201d; more than a century later, the leading environmental activist Sunita Narain reversed the terms but retained the substance of the observation: \u201cIndia\u2019s finance minister is the monsoon,\u201d she declared. Climate is woven into the fabric of Indian social, economic, and political thought in a way that it is not (or is no longer) elsewhere. In the late 20th century, that claim would have raised hackles among scholars of South Asia; it might still do so today. A fundamental assumption of modernity was that we had mastered nature. The notion of India in thrall to the monsoon would seem to perpetuate a colonial idea of India\u2019s irredeemable backwardness. To emphasize the power of the monsoon would be to portray Indian lives as so many marionettes moved by a climatic puppet master. That is how this story would have been understood a generation ago. But now, alarmed by the planetary crisis of climate change, a reminder of nature\u2019s power has different implications. This is not a story of geography as destiny. It is a story of how the idea of geography as destiny provoked, from the mid-19th century on, a whole series of social, political, and technological responses within and beyond India. Read: China wants to build \u2018sponge cities\u2019 The South Asian monsoon has effects far beyond South Asia. We know this, at least in part, because of climate research undertaken in India in the 20th century. Sir Gilbert Walker, a pioneer of global climate science, wrote in 1927 that \u201cthe climate of India is of special interest, not merely as that of the greatest tropical region in the British Empire, but also because it seems to have been designed by nature with the object of demonstrating physical processes on a huge scale.\u201d That sense of scientific opportunity, combined with the pressing material need to understand the monsoon, inspired a century of study in India. Charles Normand, Walker\u2019s successor as head of the Indian weather service, insisted that the monsoon is \u201can active, not a passive, feature in world weather.\u201d Subsequent research has confirmed his view\u2014the Asian monsoon is entwined with many aspects of the global climate. It has an important influence on global atmospheric circulation. The future behavior of the South Asian monsoon has implications for the whole world. Arguably no other part of the global climate system affects more people, more directly. The breakthroughs in tropical meteorology of the late 20th century shed new light on the scale and complexity of internal variability in the monsoon on multiple timescales\u2014from the quasiperiodic impact of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation system to the tropical-weather fluctuation pattern known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation. In recent years, the focus of scientific research has been on how the effects of anthropogenic climate change interact with the monsoon\u2019s natural variability in dangerous and unpredictable ways. The most fundamental forces driving the monsoon are the thermal contrast between the land and the ocean and the availability of moisture. Climate change affects both of these drivers of wind and rain. The warming of the ocean\u2019s surface is likely to augment the amount of moisture the monsoon winds pick up on their journey toward the Indian subcontinent. But if the ocean surface warms more rapidly than the land, which appears to be happening in equatorial waters, this would narrow the temperature gradient that drives the winds, and so weaken circulation. Put simply, many climate models predict that the first of these processes will predominate: \u201cWet gets wetter\u201d as a result of greenhouse-gas emissions. They predict, that is to say, that the moist monsoon lands will see an increase in rainfall. But the monsoon is an intricate phenomenon, as meteorologists have long known. It is increasingly clear that monsoon rainfall is affected not only by planetary warming but also by transformations on a regional scale, including the emission of aerosols\u2014from vehicles, crop burning, and domestic fires\u2014and changes in land use. The urgent challenge for climate science is to disentangle and to understand these global and regional influences on the behavior of the monsoon. And so far, the monsoon has proved much harder to capture in models than, say, global temperatures. The availability of detailed records of climate and rainfall in India\u2014which themselves are a product of the history of Indian meteorology going back to the efforts of Henry Blanford and his colleagues in the late 19th century\u2014have allowed scientists to reconstruct in detail the monsoon\u2019s behavior over the past 60 years. The picture these data present is complex, and in some ways surprising. Average summer rainfall over India has declined by around 7 percent since 1950. The cause of this downward trend in rainfall lies in the pattern of India\u2019s development since independence. Its explanation, that is to say, lies in the province of economic history. In the late 1990s, research vessels observed exceptionally high concentrations of aerosols in the northern Indian Ocean. Satellite images showed a stain that spread across the Indo-Gangetic Plain and over the Indian Ocean\u2014researchers called it the \u201cbrown cloud,\u201d an accurate, if not a poetic, description of the haze. Between January and March 1999, a large team of investigators set out to understand this brown cloud, taking readings from their base at the Kaashidhoo Observatory on one of the most remote islands of the Maldives. The project was led by Veerabhadran Ramanathan, an Indian oceanographer based at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California. One of the scientists involved was the Dutch atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, who around the same time also coined the term Anthropocene , referring to a new geological epoch in which human activity is the most important influence on Earth\u2019s physical processes. Read: A foreboding similarity in today\u2019s oceans and a 94-million-year-old catastrophe The project found that the haze was a noxious composite of sulfate, nitrate, black carbon, dust, and fly ash, as well as naturally occurring aerosols including sea salt and mineral dust. Three-quarters of the composition of the brown cloud could be attributed directly to human activity, especially concentrated along the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain and northwestern India. In this region, where up to 80 percent of the population remains rural, and where many rural families continue to be deprived of electricity, much of the black carbon is produced by domestic burning of biomass\u2014wood, crop residue, dung, and coal\u2014 used primarily for cooking. Open crop burning accounts for the rest. The stoves used in households are inefficient and combustion is incomplete, producing large amounts of soot. Apart from their likely effects on regional climate, these emissions also poison human bodies. By one estimate , more than 400,000 premature deaths each year in India can be attributed to indoor pollution. Black carbon combines, in the brown cloud, with sulfates and other aerosols\u2014and the Indo-Gangetic Plain bears an additional burden in this respect, as a result of pockets of intensive industrial and extractive activity. Since the late 19th century, the Indo-Gangetic Plain has been the core region of India\u2019s extractive industries, built around the rich coal and mineral deposits in the Chota Nagpur region. Further along the Yamuna River, the Delhi region is one of India\u2019s fastest-growing metropolitan areas, and its largest in absolute terms. Emissions have increased exponentially since the 1970s as India\u2019s population has grown, as its economy has expanded, as inequalities within and among regions have widened. The Indo-Gangetic Plain suffers from a double pathology: The sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen-dioxide emissions that accompany energy-intensive growth are combined with the black carbon that comes from the use of cheaper, dirtier fuels by millions without access to electricity. All this is shifting the monsoon\u2019s patterns. Aerosols absorb solar radiation, allowing less of it to reach Earth\u2019s surface. This cools the land, diminishes the temperature contrast between the land and sea, and weakens the atmospheric circulation that sustains the summer monsoon. Changes in circulation over the Indian subcontinent in turn affect the tightly integrated air-sea interaction that binds the Asian continent with the Indian Ocean, a system that already contains plenty of internal variability. Because of the way the Asian monsoon is linked to other parts of the planet\u2019s climate, it is possible that aerosols over South Asia have global consequences. When all these effects are coupled with the impact of global warming on the ocean and the atmosphere, the instabilities multiply. Far from counteracting the effect of greenhouse gases in any simple sense, the impact of aerosols complicates them. A further driver of regional climate change is rapid changes in land use. Over the past 150 years, forest cover over most parts of Asia has declined dramatically. The intensification of agricultural production in India, and the use of more water for irrigation, has affected the moisture of the soil, its capacity to absorb or reflect heat. Crops reflect more solar radiation than forests, which tend to absorb it; the greater reflexivity of land planted with crops makes it cooler, once again weakening the temperature differentials that drive circulation and rainfall. The tropical meteorologist Deepti Singh points out that climate models have often failed to predict the monsoon\u2019s behavior in part because they are too abstract to take into account the \u201ccomplex topography, temperature, and moisture gradients in the region that can influence the monsoon circulation.\u201d The models omit, that is, precisely the details of landscape and microclimate that the meteorologists of a century earlier were so deeply interested in, which they depicted in their detailed local and regional maps of India\u2019s climate. We are left with the most bitter of ironies. Many of the measures taken to secure India against the vagaries of the monsoon in the second half of the 20th century\u2014intensive irrigation, the planting of new crops\u2014have, through a cascade of unintended consequences, destabilized the monsoon itself. When the geographers of the early 20th century wrote of \u201cmonsoon Asia,\u201d they saw the monsoon as sovereign\u2014it shaped the lives of hundreds of millions of people, who waited on its every move. Monsoon Asia means something quite different now, when the monsoon\u2019s behavior, increasingly erratic, responds to human intervention.

His attempt at a moderate, even milquetoast energy bill\u2014which included some mild cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014proved too aggressive for his co-partisans. On Friday, members of Australia\u2019s center-right Liberal Party voted him out of office. Pity for Turnbull, though at least he can he can trudge home to his mansion on Sydney Harbor . And pity for Australia, which lately has had some trouble keeping its prime ministers in office. (It\u2019s churned through six of them since 2007.) Yet even setting that context aside, Turnbull\u2019s tumble remains a disquieting sign for anyone hoping for an aggressive global climate policy. In Australia\u2014where global warming has contributed to the die-off of half the coral in the Great Barrier Reef since 2016 \u2014even a mild climate bill could not pass under a conservative government. It points to an emerging pattern: Moderate national leaders\u2014on both the center-left and center-right\u2014in some of the world\u2019s richest and most advanced countries are finding it far easier to talk about climate change than to actually fight it. At a basic level, this pattern holds up, well, everywhere. Every country except the United States supports the Paris Agreement on climate change. But no major developed country is on track to meet its Paris climate goals, according to the Climate Action Tracker , an independent analysis produced by three European research organizations . Even Germany , Japan , and the United Kingdom \u2014where right-wing governments have made combatting climate change a national priority\u2014seem likely to miss their goals. Simply put: This kind of failure, writ large, would devastate Earth in the century to come. The world would blow its stated goal of limiting atmospheric temperature rise. Heatwaves might regularly last for six punishing weeks , sea levels could soar by feet in a few short decades , and certain fragile ecosystems\u2014like the delicate Arctic permafrost or the kaleidoscopic plenty of coral reefs\u2014would disappear from the planet entirely. Australia\u2019s recent instability further complicates this unease. The global climate action of 2016 may be producing something like a worldwide climate backlash\u2014especially in countries with powerful fossil-fuel interests, like Australia and Canada. Or\u2014far more worryingly for climate advocates\u2014these changes in policy may be trickling down from the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases of them all: the United States. The victims of climate change are already here Take Canada. In 2015, Justin Trudeau campaigned for prime minister by citing his support for a national carbon price. (A carbon price is a type of climate policy that charges polluters for every ton of heat-trapping gas they dump into the atmosphere.) After winning the election, Trudeau took a compromise strategy on fossil fuels, proposing an economy-wide carbon price while endorsing the construction of several massive new oil-export pipelines . Two years later, Trudeau\u2019s carbon-pricing scheme is in trouble. The government has already slashed the ambition of its initial proposal. The Conservative Party, which opposes Trudeau, has dubbed the carbon price a \u201ctax on everything\u201d and its leader says a future government would repeal any carbon price. The new premier of Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, says he will fight the carbon price when it takes effect in January of next year. It seems likely that the 2019 elections in Canada\u2014in which Trudeau faces reelection\u2014will hinge in part on what voters think of the carbon price. While that vote is still more than a year away, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party has lost its early lead in polling and is now essentially tied with the Conservative Party. But political opposition is not the only reason Trudeau has watered down his plan. His party seems to have real concerns about the economic consequences of the policy. In order to avoid putting any one country at a competitive disadvantage, global governments vowed to fight climate change together in 2015. But President Donald Trump abrogated this informal arrangement. Since taking office, he ravaged American climate policy, repealing his predecessor\u2019s pollution-reduction rules on cars, trucks, and power plants. Coupled with Trump\u2019s new tariffs and trade policy, a carbon tax could ding Canadian competitiveness. This month, Trudeau\u2019s government announced that it will tax only 20 percent of carbon emissions, not the planned 30 percent. Some Trump-threatened industries, including cement and steelmaking, will only see 10 percent of their emissions taxed, according to The Globe and Mail . \u201c If the countries with whom we are competing\u2014and especially that big one to the south of us\u2014do not have that kind of a [carbon tax] system in place, then you are having your hands tied behind your back,\u201d Dennis Darby, the president of a Canadian manufacturing organization, told that paper . Has climate change intensified 2017\u2019s western wildfires Yet even as he fights for his political life, Trudeau has found it easy to keep supporting new fossil-fuel infrastructure. In May, his government purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline project , which will likely assure its construction. The pipeline, which is opposed by environmental groups and several indigenous nations, will let Canada easily export hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day to Asia. If Trudeau loses next year, and conservatives repeal his carbon tax, then his government\u2019s climate legacy will be a pipeline, not a reduction in emissions. And if Canada abandons its climate policy, then it will follow the path set by another Anglophone petit petrostate: Australia. Oz is the only country in the world to adopt an ambitious price on carbon pollution and then promptly repeal it. Its aggressive climate policy\u2014adopted by the left-leaning Labor Party in 2012\u2014was repealed by Prime Minister Tony Abbot\u2019s rightwing government two years later. Which is to say that Australian climate policy is already weird and mangled\u2014and, indeed, that Australian energy policy as a whole is weird and mangled. Australia should have cheap electricity: It is very sunny, and very windy, and its miners haul roughly $50 billion in U.S. dollars of coal out of the ground every year. Yet recently Aussies have been paying some of the highest power prices in the world. Since 2015, household power bills have doubled in cost in some states. Electricity in Sydney is now more than twice as expensive as it is in New York. Turnbull\u2019s downfall has to be understood in light of that policy disaster. The former prime minister spent months trying to put together a \u201cNational Energy Guarantee\u201d that would address its electricity crisis, mostly by making Obamacare-style improvements to the power market. The same bill also legislated some modest emissions cuts that were promised under the Paris Agreement. Rightwing lawmakers, many of whom are allied with Australia\u2019s booming fossil-fuel industry, seized on the climate aspects of the legislation. So last week, Turnbull abandoned it. The embarrassment ultimately led to his ouster: By Friday, his party\u2019s right wing had voted to replace him. So Australia\u2019s energy policy is now again adrift. Its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, is perceived in the country as being on the center-right, and he\u2019s said he won\u2019t abandon the Paris Agreement. But Australian carbon emissions have been rising for six years and it\u2019s totally unclear whether it will meet its greenhouse-gas targets . The new prime minister has also already appointed a far-right opponent of renewable energy to lead Australia\u2019s ministry of energy and environment. What else drove this coup? Look to a July speech made by Tony Abbot, a former Australian prime minister and by far its most conservative leader this decade. He exhorted Australia to follow President Trump\u2019s lead and leave the Paris Agreement \u2014which is notable, since Abbot himself signed the agreement. But the situation had changed: \u201cAbsent America, my government would not have signed up to the Paris treaty, certainly not with the current target,\u201d he said. \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris agreement,\u201d he continued, \u201cwould be the best way to keep prices down and employment up; and, to save our party from a political legacy that could haunt us for the next decade at least.\u201d Abbot then engaged in a bit of Trumpianism, rejecting many of the conclusions of mainstream climate science. \u201cStorms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago.\u201d (These claims are respectively false , likely false , debatable , and false .) All this does not bode well for advocates of climate action. Extreme weather is battering Australia on all fronts: Carbon-warmed oceans are plundering its Great Barrier Reef , and a record-breaking drought is ravaging the country\u2019s well-populated southeast. Yet even its center-right-led, middling attempt at a climate policy is withering on the vine. On Monday, in one of his first public appearances since taking office, Prime Minister Morrison declined to comment on whether climate change is intensifying the country\u2019s drought. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave that debate,\u201d he said, \u201cfor another day.\u201d","headline":"The Global Rightward Shift on Climate Change","article_name":568684.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/a-global-rightward-shift-on-climate-change\/568684\/","date_published":"2018-08-28 18:51:00","article_length":9472,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:52.907844","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/08\/a-global-rightward-shift-on-climate-change\/568684\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"\u201cWe have endured floods, and fires, and storms,\u201d he said, without saying what made them all worse. President Donald Trump didn\u2019t mention climate change or global warming in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. This is, on one hand, the most predictable thing in the world. Throughout his political career, Trump has rarely seemed interested in understanding the science of Earth\u2019s climate. Last week, he misspoke about the climate again , claiming \u201cit was getting too cold all over the place.\u201d He has canceled policies that prepare national parks for climate change and adapt U.S. naval bases to rising sea levels . Repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s extensive climate legacy has unified the Trump administration like little else. So why would he mention climate change in his speech? Because\u2014on the other hand\u2014the United States just survived a year of disasters that were shaped and intensified by climate change. Three hurricanes whipped the United States, several of them bearing the fingerprints of climate change . A third of Puerto Rico is still without power . Record-breaking wildfires raged across the West . It was the most expensive year for natural disasters in U.S. history. NASA and NOAA declared 2017 one of the hottest years ever measured ; more than a dozen federal science agencies published a lengthy report affirming the reality of global warming . Does it make sense to harangue the president for the omission? I ask myself: If Trump hailed from a Republican party that had not largely disavowed the scientific fact of climate change, would he have mentioned the phenomenon? I think he would. Indeed, the president came about as close as possible to mentioning climate change\u2014without saying the magic words. \u201cWe have endured floods, and fires, and storms,\u201d he said early in his speech. \u201cWe saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing with their fishing boats to save people from the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.\u201d Later, he praised Americans\u2019 ability to \u201cpush the bounds of science and discovery.\u201d Those passages would have been sharper, more accurate, and more befitting the scale of the problem if the president recognized the single issue uniting them. But saying the name of that problem is now verboten\u2014a sacrifice to a particularly Republican form of political correctness. And so the country winds into another year, with a federal government that can utter the name of any number of threats to Americans\u2014except the one that is already inundating its shores, scorching its homes, and shaping the lives of its children.","headline":"Trump Doesn't Mention Climate Change in His State of the Union","article_name":551930.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/01\/trump-doesnt-mention-climate-change-in-his-state-of-the-union\/551930\/","date_published":"2018-01-31 14:09:00","article_length":2574,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:53.932533","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/01\/trump-doesnt-mention-climate-change-in-his-state-of-the-union\/551930\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":">This week, Harry Reid unveiled the Democrats' latest attempt at an energy package. Unlike earlier drafts, this legislation has some chance of passing. Trouble is, it will do very little about climate change (rather ironic for something we used to call a climate change bill). It includes no carbon cap, no efficiency benchmarks, no renewable electricity standard--all of which, in some form, were part of the Waxman-Markey legislation that passed the House more than a year ago. So what went wrong on the road to controlling global warming and getting closer to energy independence? According to key environmental and political leaders, several mistakes are now clear. One was an obsessive focus on winning the House vote, but not on the message war that followed, according to Daniel Lashof, director of the Natural Resouces Defense Council's Climate Center. Last summer marked the beginning of the Tea Party backlash to big D.C. legislation, and \"Democrats were not prepared, and we [in the environmental community] didn't do enough to explain, why this was good policy.\" The legislation was defined by its opponents as \"cap and tax\"--higher electricity prices at a time of economic crisis. Senators saw the pain the energy bill's opponents inflicted on members of the House, and were reluctant to experience it themselves. Another big mistake was a flabby response to the so-called Climategate scandal--even as the fundamental science of climate change was widely re-affirmed. As one environmentalist put it, \"we couldn't sell sacrifice even before Climategate, but now that people had a phony excuse not to believe [global warming] was even happening, our job went from hard to impossible.\" Key supporters were distracted: health care, financial reform, and stimulus legislation were all given greater attention by Senate leaders and, especially, the White House. Tony Kreindler of Environmental Defense says, \"it should be self-evident we haven't seen the level of engagement by the president necessary to seal the deal.\" Losing the endorsement of Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the only Republican onboard, was a severe blow. As one Democratic senator remarked, \"Lindsey leaving was terrible, and it says something bad about the senators running the process. [Barbara] Boxer and [John] Kerry are totally committed, their hearts are in the right place, but were they really the best people to reach out to the senators who hadn't decided?\" Kreindler also emphasized the lack of support from utilities and manufacturers, without which achieving 60 Senate votes was extraordinarily difficult. \"We were close with the utilities, not with the manufacturers ... these agreements are important not because of special interest politics and the influence of big money but because having everyone at the table helps make policies that are durable and effective.\" Where do greens go from here? They have three possible paths: If, for whatever reason, the Reid bill fails to pass before the Congressional August recess, senators could try again on a utility-specific cap in September. This was the proposal Democrats pushed after a more universal carbon cap failed to move. But electric utilities only generate about a third of greenhouse gas emissions. The other downside to this approach, as Lashof argues, is \"a source-by-source program provides less certainty for companies and less of a long-term signal to invest in alternatives.\"\u00a0 There is also no guarantee a utility-only bill will be more successful in the fall than it has been this summer. Second, they could try a comprehensive approach again in the lame-duck session (after the November elections) when several Democrats have lost--and therefore won't feel any political constraint against acting on the basis of what, presumably, they really believe. Yet if any of the lame-ducks want a political future in coal country they might remain opposed. Third, Democrats could attempt a carbon cap again in the next Congress. Most assume they will face fewer distractions then; no big legislative push--on the scale of financial or health reform--is planned. But they will also face far more Republicans. \"Prospects are bleak now, bleaker later this year, and bleakest of all next year,\" said one environmental lobbyist, \"I don't know where the path forward is.\" As it now stands, is the Reid bill worth supporting? Every environmental leader with whom I spoke said yes. The good news is it does nothing to strip the EPA of Supreme Court-approved power to limit carbon pollution on its own. Other agencies (like the Departments of Energy or Transportation) could act in particular sectors. The Reid bill also contains non-controversial provisions that will reduce energy waste and strengthen oil industry regulation.\u00a0 Neither will it take off the table incentives to approve cap-and-trade at a later date--given that none of the pollution credits and industry subsidies in Waxman-Markey carried over to the Reid bill. Yet as Lashof concludes, \"it's a fine proposal, but this has nothing to do with responding to climate change.\"","headline":"A Wrong Turn on Climate Change","article_name":60598.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2010\/07\/a-wrong-turn-on-climate-change\/60598\/","date_published":"2010-07-29 19:00:43","article_length":5080,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:54.289801","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2010\/07\/a-wrong-turn-on-climate-change\/60598\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"Francis\u2019s first encyclical is a cry to save the environment\u2014and make a priority of theology over politics. \u201cThe majority of people living on our planet profess to be believers.\u201d It is a statement of fact, an intellectual premise, a gentle claim of territory. In his new encyclical on environmental degradation, Laudato Si, Pope Francis is not just addressing the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics. He\u2019s tagging God into the global conversation on climate change. The document, which was leaked on Monday by an Italian newspaper and officially released by the Vatican on Thursday, bitterly condemns the human failures that have eroded much of the environment. The pope rattles off fact after fact about the pitiful state of the earth: Pesticides have contaminated farmers\u2019 soil. Air pollution has poisoned cities. Man-made waste checkers landscapes. There\u2019s not enough clean water for people to drink or tropical forests to regulate carbon in the atmosphere. Whole species of animals are dying out. Humans ruined the earth, the pope says, but sin ruined humans. \u201cThe violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe ecological crisis is also a summons to profound interior conversion.\u201d Francis knows all about the Rio+20 conference and cap-and-trade and carbon taxes. He spends whole passages on green building standards and sustainable energy use. Every effort is important, he says, but ultimately politics and technology have failed to save the earth. \u201c[Some] tell us that ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any need for ethical considerations or deep change,\u201d he writes. \u201cEach age tends to have only a meager awareness of its own limitations.\u201d Though Church leaders have long spoken up for the environment, Francis has made environmental issues a priority of his papacy. This is the first encyclical that is fully his, and the Catholic Church\u2019s first-ever dedicated entirely to this topic. The pope is offering the world a moral vocabulary for talking about climate change, shifting global attention from the macro solutions of policy summits to the personal ethics of environmental stewardship. In the book of Luke, Jesus looks at the birds and says, \u201cNot one of them is forgotten before God.\u201d In writing Laudato Si , Francis has taken this parable and turned it back on humankind: Policymakers and scientists may try to stop the warming of the earth, but ultimately, we are each responsible for the destruction of creation. The opening lines of Laudato Si are drawn from a 13th-century poem called the \u201cCanticle of the Creatures,\u201d written by a different Francis. \u201cBe praised, my Lord, through our sister Mother Earth, who feeds us and rules us, and produces various fruits with colored flowers and herbs,\u201d the saint from Assisi wrote. The current pope chose his namesake for three reasons: his concern for the poor, his love of peace, and his care for creation. Historical references like this are peppered throughout the document, and they serve as an important reminder to an often-giddy media that loves to write about today\u2019s revolutionary pope: In the Church, precedent is everything. Francis\u2019s argument is deeply grounded in Catholic teachings dating back to the late-19th-century writings of Pope Leo XIII (and before that, Jesus). Francis eagerly praises his predecessors: In his 1990 World Day of Peace speech, John Paul II declared the environment to be a moral priority of the Church, warning that \u201cworld peace is threatened not only by the arms race, regional conflicts, and continued injustices among peoples and nations, but also by a lack of due respect for nature.\u201d Benedict XVI was nicknamed \u201cthe green pope\u201d because he spoke on environmental issues so frequently; he had solar panels installed on the roof of the Vatican and even rolled out a hybrid version of the Popemobile. In other words, this is far from the Church\u2019s first foray into environmentalism. \u201cI always remind my environmental friends that St. Francis was ours before he was theirs,\u201d said John Carr, a professor at Georgetown and former staffer at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cThis didn\u2019t begin with Earth Day or Al Gore. It began with Genesis.\u201d What\u2019s significant about this document, though, is its scope and ambition. Popes have a number of ways to spread messages, including homilies, speeches, or more informal texts called apostolic exhortations . Encyclicals are considered formal teachings on Catholic doctrine; collectively, popes have written about 300 of them since the first was released 275 years ago. Often, they\u2019re directed at bishops and priests, but not so this time: During his regular Sunday address this week, Francis said, \u201cThis encyclical is aimed at everyone.\u201d It\u2019s also really, really long. Over the course of many pages\u2014192 in some versions\u2014Francis talks a lot about the environment itself, including extensive laments about the effects of climate change. But the document is focused more on humans than nature, echoing two of the most important themes of Francis\u2019s papacy: caring for the poor and preserving the family. At the core of his argument is this fact: The \u201cworst impact [of climate change] will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades.\u201d At Catholic Relief Services, an organization that offers disaster and development aid to roughly 100 million people in 93 countries each year, volunteers and staffers have seen these effects firsthand. \u201cIn particular, we\u2019re seeing different weather patterns that lead to persistent droughts, floods, and storms that are more frequent than people are used to,\u201d said Joan Rosenhauer, the organization\u2019s executive vice president of U.S. operations. \u201cFarmers are no longer able to grow the crops that they have for generations, because the land is getting too dry or the rainfall is too unpredictable or the temperatures are rising.\u201d In addition to small island nations, which are often hit hard by storms, environmental degradation is felt most acutely in Latin America and Africa, Rosenhauer said. Coincidentally or not, these are also two of the most important regions for the future of the Church. As of 2010 , Latin America accounted for roughly 40 percent of the global Catholic population. And while Sub-Saharan Africa only accounted for 16 percent of the world\u2019s Catholics, it\u2019s where the faith is growing most rapidly: Demographers predict that the region\u2019s Christian population could nearly double in size by 2050, although some of that growth will be among Protestants. Undoubtedly, this shapes how the pope thinks about his teachings. To take one example, in Latin America, \u201cthere are these vast mines where the worker protections and the environmental protections are not as stringent as in other countries, and so we see humans suffering: We see more birth defects and shorter lives,\u201d said Dan Misleh, the executive director of the Catholic Climate Covenant, a network of organizations dedicated to conserving the environment. \u201cPope Francis has that perspective\u2014he comes from Argentina.\u201d But the pope uses different language than a climate activist might. Throughout the encyclical, he refers to the modern world\u2019s \u201cthrowaway culture.\u201d This includes literal trash\u2014\u201chundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and industrial sources,\u201d he writes. But it also encompasses a mentality of excessive consumption and an orientation toward profit maximization, especially in the \u201cglobal north.\u201d People in the developed world are morally obligated to those in developing countries, he says, because when they buy things, it\u2019s at the direct expense of the labor, health, and, sometimes, lives of the poor. As Benedict wrote in his 2009 encyclical, Caritas in Veritate , \u201cIt is good for people to realize that purchasing is always a moral\u2014and not simply economic\u2014act.\u201d The metaphor of the \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d is helpful for understanding another important, albeit minor, theme of the encyclical: the importance of the family in caring for the environment. \u201cIn the Catholic tradition, the human is not only sacred, but social. The principle social unit is family,\u201d said Carr. To Francis, cultivating moral life through the family\u2014and cultivating human life in general\u2014is a core part of caring for creation. This is why, in an encyclical about the environment, the pope writes that abortion is unforgiveable. \u201cSince everything is interrelated, concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion,\u201d he says. Carr sees this as part of the larger metaphor: \u201c\u2018Throwaway culture\u2019 is his description of what is wrong with contemporary society. In his view, and in the Church\u2019s view, that begins with the unborn child, or throwing away an embryo,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate,\u201d Francis writes. \u201cAt times, developing countries face forms of international pressure which make economic assistance contingent on certain policies of \u2018reproductive health.\u2019\u201d In making this comment, he\u2019s taking aim at a whole swath of the development and environmentalist community, including aid organizations and governments. Throughout the encyclical, he slams what could roughly be called \u201ctechnological solutionism,\u201d when \u201clife gradually becomes a surrender to situations conditioned by technology, itself viewed as the principal key to the meaning of existence.\u201d It\u2019s a somewhat obtuse reminder that the pope is neither a liberal activist nor a technocrat intent on finding simple solutions. His encyclical is a sermon, not a white paper, and he\u2019s comfortable criticizing do-gooders and multinational corporations in the same breath. Although Francis acknowledges efforts to enact global climate-change policies, he\u2019s fairly critical of their efficacy. \u201cIt is remarkable how weak international political responses have been,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe failure of global summits on the environment [makes] it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance.\u201d Regulations can be helpful, he argues, but they are often ineffective because governments fail to enforce them. \u201cThere are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good.\u201d It\u2019s a hefty critique, and strategic: This November, the United Nations will host a climate-change conference in Paris in the hopes of producing new, legally binding global guidelines on carbon emissions\u2014a follow-up to the now-expired Kyoto Protocol. But though the pope may have one of the world\u2019s most impressive stocks of soft power, he\u2019s not a policymaker; he doesn\u2019t have the power to create new global guidelines on climate change. It\u2019s one thing to critique, but how does the pope propose to fix the planet? \u201cOur difficulty in taking up this challenge seriously has much to do with an ethical and cultural decline which has accompanied the deterioration of the environment.\u201d This is the blessing and burden of speaking as a priest rather than a policymaker: Francis sees the destruction of the earth as a structural problem, but also a personal one. Even for those who are concerned about the effects of climate change and living conditions in the developing world, it can be difficult to embrace responsibility; the actions and intentions of one person seem so small, so morally irrelevant, in the context of all of creation. But this is exactly what Francis calls for: \u201cprofound interior conversion.\u201d To the policy-minded, and perhaps some of the technocrats whom the pope has spent paragraphs criticizing, this may seem like a pretty thin recommendation. But coming from Francis, it\u2019s the most logical possible conclusion. Sin created the division between nature and man; this is the story of the fall from God\u2019s grace in the Garden of Eden, and the essential theme of Christianity. In Catholicism, redemption from sin is found in taking the Eucharist, which Catholics see as the literal body and blood of Christ. It\u2019s the act of an individual, not a committee; reform of the world begins with reform of the heart, on climate change or anything else. This is not to say that Francis totally eschews the practical. He praises the efficiency of solar energy and calls for a significant decrease in the use of non-renewable resources. He emphasizes the importance of farming and local agriculture in particular: \u201cWe were not meant to be inundated by cement, asphalt, glass and metal, and deprived of physical contact with nature,\u201d he writes. He emphasizes the power of homes in providing dignity for the poor, perhaps shaped by his time walking the slums of Buenos Aires. His efforts are also remarkably ecumenical. At the press conference announcing the encyclical\u2019s release on Thursday, the Vatican featured four official presenters: Cardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and one of the primary architects of the encyclical;\u00a0\u00a0John Zizioulas, representing the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Orthodox Church; and two scientists. One of them, John Schellnhuber, a German professor, pointed out that it was perhaps the first time that a major Church document was introduced partly with a PowerPoint presentation. This kind of collaboration is highly unorthodox for a Vatican event held on this scale, said Kevin Irwin, a priest at the Catholic University of America and former staffer at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The pope is not just speaking to those of other faiths and those who study the climate; he\u2019s speaking with them. As Zizioulas put it, the encyclical is \u201can effort to face together the most profound existential [crises] that occupy humanity in its entirety.\u201d As a political document, Laudato Si is an expansive analysis of the effects of the powerful on the powerless. As an economic document, it is a scathing critique of profit motives. And as a cultural document, it shows how one charismatic leader can rally enormous interest for a global issue, perhaps more than an army of activists can. But as a moral document, it shows the breadth and power of theology in deciphering the modern world. Francis calls on \u201cevery person who lives on this planet\u201d to wrestle with the sin of climate change, but he does so mercifully. He mourns the destruction of the earth\u2019s forests and pollution of the earth\u2019s waters because he takes joy in creation. \u201cTeach us to contemplate you in the beauty of the universe, for all things speak of you,\u201d he writes at the end of his encyclical. It\u2019s not a solution. It\u2019s a humble prayer for a plundered world.","headline":"How the Pope Plans to Stop Climate Change","article_name":396200.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-encyclical-moral-climate-change\/396200\/","date_published":"2015-06-18 10:04:25","article_length":14915,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:56.292848","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/06\/pope-francis-encyclical-moral-climate-change\/396200\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate skeptics aren\u2019t generally more science illiterate than everyone else, according to a new poll. The most hopeful news in Tuesday\u2019s big Pew report on climate change and partisanship isn\u2019t particularly uplifting, honestly. The research agency found that 70 percent of Americans believe that climate scientists should have a \u201cmajor role\u201d in the country\u2019s climate and energy policy. This is roughly like 70 percent of Americans saying they believe seismologists should have a say in the nation\u2019s earthquake policy. And after that vote of support, confidence in the field drops off. Less than a third of Americans think climate scientists understand the causes of climate change very well. Less than a fifth think they understand the best ways to address it. But most Americans, across both parties, do credit climate scientists with at least a fair amount of confidence to act in the public interest. These were all findings of the Pew Research Center\u2019s 1,100-person poll of Americans on their feelings not just about climate change but on the whole bundle of climate and energy issues. The poll\u2019s headline number is that 48 percent of Americans correctly understand the Earth to be warming due to human activity. This number has recovered to 2006 levels, when it stood at 50 percent. It fell below 40 percent following the election of Barack Obama. The report also confirms that Republicans and Democrats\u2014especially on the parties\u2019 respective right and left wings\u2014hold differing views on climate change. But it finds that, especially on the left, these views are modestly moderated by someone\u2019s understanding of general science. In other words, a Democrat with a high amount of science knowledge (including on health and biological concepts) is more likely to correctly state that humans are causing climate change than a Democrat with low science knowledge. Whereas being highly educated or having a high amount of science knowledge doesn\u2019t make Republicans any more likely to say the same. Generally, Democrats and Republicans performed about the same on the study\u2019s tests of scientific literacy that did not ask about the climate. \u201cThus, it could be the case that people\u2019s political orientations are an anchoring point for applying their knowledge\u2014rather than the other way around,\u201d says the report. \u201cPew is more than just a public polling firm. They generate knowledge that is relevant to scholarly opinion,\u201d said Dan Kahan, a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School who researches how group identification shapes public understanding of risk. He praised the study\u2019s comprehensive evaluation of its respondents\u2019 scientific literacy, something he said is rare for polls on climate issues. \u201cIt is very striking how sharp the polarization is on climate change issues and even on some energy issues, like fracking and nuclear, but then not on things like solar,\u201d Kahan told me. \u201cThat can mean that people don\u2019t really have the same level of interest in solar energy as they do on the issues that are polarizing them.\u201d The Pew study found that more than 80 percent of Americans support expanding wind and solar energy. Somewhat counterintuitively, Kahan said that this broad support may mean politicians can\u2019t build campaigns around them: Because wind and solar are so popular, support for them is unlikely to shape people\u2019s decisions about whom to vote for. \u201cThat may just mean that [the public] is not intensely interested in it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to fixate on issues that are really divisive.\u201d Many people support campaign-finance reform, for instance, but political-science research indicates few people make voting decisions based on it. That said, these healthy majorities haven\u2019t translated into party platforms yet\u2014at least on a national level. Hillary Clinton\u2019s energy plan is far more amenable to renewable energy (and also far more specific) than Donald Trump\u2019s. But some state-level Republican leaders have been praising renewable energy lately, and all 10 of the congressional districts supplying the most wind power are GOP-controlled. Here are a few more interesting factlets from the Pew study:","headline":"Republicans Can Understand Science and Still Deny Climate Change","article_name":503003.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/10\/republicans-can-understand-science-and-still-deny-climate-change\/503003\/","date_published":"2016-10-05 17:04:23","article_length":4129,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:56.506924","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/10\/republicans-can-understand-science-and-still-deny-climate-change\/503003\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate-concerned donors should focus on helping to pass climate policy, not offset their emissions, an advisory group says. \u00a0 On a dollar-for-dollar basis, where will your money do the most to fight climate change? The economist Daniel Stein has a clear answer: You should give to groups that lobby for aggressive climate policies. And if you\u2019re an American, he has three such groups in mind: the Evergreen Collaborative, Carbon180, and the Clean Air Task Force. \u201cIf you\u2019re like Joe Schmo, and you\u2019re looking to do something for climate, I think you should give to policy,\u201d Stein told me. \u201cWe think it\u2019s something like 10 times more effective to give to policy than to give to one of these projects that are directly doing emissions reductions.\u201d A year ago, I profiled Giving Green, a new organization that applies the principles of effective altruism to fighting climate change. It tries to answer one of the most common questions I get as a reporter\u2014\u201cWhere should I give my money to fight climate change?\u201d\u2014but with some degree of quantitative rigor. Its list of recommendations has changed slightly since last year. Gone from the list is the Sunrise Movement, which Stein lauded\u2014\u201cI really do believe that the existence of Sunrise has led, at least to a certain extent, to major climate bills being passed in the Biden administration,\u201d\u2014but which is going through an internal restructuring and has yet to publish a strategy for the next few years. (It also needs individual donations less than it did, Stein said, because it has secured more institutional support.) In its place are Carbon180, which advocates for policy to accelerate direct carbon removal, and the Evergreen Collaborative, a policy shop composed of veterans of Jay Inslee\u2019s climate-focused presidential campaign . Evergreen \u201chas very quickly become very influential, in terms of figuring out how to take the broader ideas of the progressive climate movement and turn [them] into actual laws that can be passed,\u201d Stein said. And Giving Green has continued recommending the Clean Air Task Force, which works with politicians from both parties to deploy technologies, such as carbon removal and even carbon capture and storage, that will ultimately be necessary in a zero-carbon world. Read: The best way to donate to fight climate change (probably) Giving Green\u2019s list does include a few groups that will offset carbon pollution or remove it entirely . Among these are Tradewater, which finds and destroys industrial refrigerant gases that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and Climeworks and Charm Industrial, two start-ups that remove carbon from the atmosphere directly. But it \u201creally, really, really does not recommend\u201d that individuals who can donate to political causes give to these offsetting or removal groups, Stein said\u2014the bang for your buck is just much higher passing a bill. The only reliable carbon-removal firms are fully booked for the next few years as well, according to Giving Green\u2019s research, meaning that even if you paid them to remove a ton of carbon from the atmosphere today, they wouldn\u2019t do it until 2023. Giving Green is an experiment in effective altruism, a social movement that fuses traditional charity, classical economics, and a particularly cosmopolitan strain of utilitarianism to form a new approach to philanthropy. Where, the movement\u2019s adherents ask, can a marginal dollar do the most good? On what causes can spending the smallest amount of money prevent the most suffering? The answer is almost always making a small addition to a very poor country\u2019s health system, such as distributing mosquito bed nets or vitamins. Or it\u2019s just giving very poor people money . EA tends to target the world\u2019s most impoverished people for assistance, both because they presumably suffer the most and because their problems are the cheapest to solve. It might take hundreds of thousands of dollars to cure an American of a chronic disease, for instance. But according to the nonprofit Givewell, which makes EA-informed charitable recommendations, only $3,000 can save the life of someone in Burkina Faso or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire by providing them with free vitamin-A supplements. Even though I don\u2019t always agree with it, I find EA\u2019s answers to the problem of how to be a good person fascinating . But focusing on climate change reveals some of the limits of this strategy. Climate change will harm extremely poor people, but most carbon pollution comes from rich or middle-income countries\u2014and so it must be addressed at the (very expensive) source. The climate problem throws EA, which often looks for interventions so simple that they seem apolitical, back into the world of politics. Read: Democrats may be on the verge of climate disaster This year, Giving Green\u2019s recommendations were adopted by The Life You Can Save , an EA nonprofit co-founded by Peter Singer, a Princeton bioethics professor. Singer, a luminary in the EA world, is famous for arguing one of its most important ideas: If you can help someone at minimal cost to yourself, you should . \u201cClimate change is something that is having, and increasingly will have, a huge effect on extreme poverty. It\u2019s people in extreme poverty who will be the worst affected by it,\u201d Singer told me in an interview. \u201cSo we feel we need to get into that area, simply in order to carry out successfully a mission of continuing to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, large-scale extreme poverty around the world.\u201d Of course, intervening in a political system is harder than figuring out a precise health-based intervention. Whereas EA advocates normally prefer to measure their interventions through arduous economic assessments and randomized control trials, you can\u2019t run an A\/B test on history. Giving Green tries to do the best that it can in this regard, and indeed, it advises donors to give to policy groups specifically because the models show they have an outsize impact. But it has to fall back on models alone. Singer recognized that Giving Green\u2019s methodology differed from that used in other EA problems. That\u2019s fine, he said\u2014\u201crigorous methodology is not applicable to all of the problems that cause and maintain extreme poverty.\u201d \u201cIf we are to deal with those causes, we need to relax some of those standards,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, things like randomized controlled trials can\u2019t really apply in all areas, and we would be missing out on some very important issues if we don\u2019t broaden that methodology.\u201d You can read more of Giving Green\u2019s recommendations on its website .","headline":"A New Estimate of the \u2018Most Effective\u2019 Way to Fight Climate Change","article_name":621013.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/newsletters\/archive\/2021\/12\/most-effective-nonprofits-fight-climate-change\/621013\/","date_published":"2021-12-15 11:00:00","article_length":6581,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:57.467512","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/newsletters\/archive\/2021\/12\/most-effective-nonprofits-fight-climate-change\/621013\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A note on the false dichotomy between prevention and treatment In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said that now is not the time to talk about climate change. \u201cHere\u2019s the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm, versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced.\u201d Fortunately this is not a choice that need be made. There is vulgarity in politicizing tragedies for the sake of gaining power, and crassness in pointing fingers and placing blame instead of mourning a tragedy. But of course these aren\u2019t the only options. In the interest of minimizing harm to people, it\u2019s always an important time to talk about climate change. We don\u2019t have to choose between helping current victims and working to prevent the next tragedy. This is a false dichotomy of the sort that\u2019s commonly used to silence talk of prevention and public health that implicates powerful industries. In the wake of mass shootings, for example, the supposed choice is between mourning loss of life and talking about the instruments of violence. In this case the choice is supposedly between rescuing people and talking about climate change. Pruitt doesn\u2019t seem to favor talking about climate change much at all. Even before arriving at the EPA, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he led the fight against the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan. And already, his EPA appears to be limiting study of the subject. The agency now reportedly has a Trump campaign aide monitoring research-grant applications for \u201cthe double-C word.\u201d In exiting the Paris Climate Accord, the president, too, has removed the United States from a position of leading climate discourse to undermining it. While claiming to be focused firstly on American economic prosperity, Trump has denied the scientific premise that will shape the future of the global energy economy. His administration is undoing policies that would keep sustainable energy a priority for the economic future of the country, not to mention the well-being of its citizens. At the same time, this week Congress authorized $7.9 billion in disaster-relief funds for Harvey. Billions more could soon be needed, as hurricanes Irma  and Jose now represent the first time two Atlantic systems have simultaneously exceeded 150 miles per hour. Even amid this unprecedented sequence of hurricanes and destruction, most Americans are not in the path of danger. Those who want to lend a hand\u2014to save lives and minimize harm and do something\u2014stand to do much good by using this moment of awareness to prepare for a severe-weather event that does eventually affect their community. Doing so does not require litigating the exact degree to which carbon emissions contributed or didn\u2019t contribute to these exact hurricanes. It only means acknowledging that climate change is occurring, and it increases the likelihood of severe weather that will harm people. In addition to preparing homes and communities accordingly, we make daily and hourly decisions about how much we contribute to that risk, and how much we do to mitigate it. It\u2019s more than possible to talk simultaneously about prevention and treatment; it\u2019s irresponsible not to.","headline":"It Is a Time to Talk About Climate Change","article_name":539259.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/09\/fake-dichotomies\/539259\/","date_published":"2017-09-08 19:25:27","article_length":3266,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:58.009044","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/09\/fake-dichotomies\/539259\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It\u2019s one of the most cost-effective climate policies the U.S. has ever considered, according to a new analysis. Over the past year, my climate reporting has had a few preoccupations. They include: Now, I have an occasion to bring all three together! A new analysis from researchers at the University of Chicago and the Rhodium Group, an energy-research firm, finds that one of President Joe Biden\u2019s marquee energy proposals\u2014the one of the most likely to make it through Congress\u2014has a good chance of working. Biden\u2019s clean-energy tax credits\u2014a set of incentives that would push the United States to generate more electricity through wind, solar, and other zero-carbon resources\u2014would be one of the most cost-effective climate policies in American history, according to the analysis. The researchers\u2019 study, which has not been peer-reviewed, finds that the policy\u2019s benefits will be three to four times larger than its costs, creating as much as projected $1.5 trillion in economic surplus while eliminating more than 5 billion tons of planet-warming carbon pollution through 2050. \u201cI will confess I was always a little skeptical of the tax incentives. I was concerned that they were expensive on a cost-per-ton-abated basis,\u201d Michael Greenstone , a co-author of the study and the Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago, told me. \u201cI came away from this quite surprised at how beneficial this was.\u201d (I should disclose that I worked with Greenstone last year when I was a journalist in residence at the University of Chicago\u2019s Energy Policy Institute.) \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that we get opportunities to have policies with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3 or 4 to 1. Normally it\u2019s, like, 1.3 to 1, and we economists get very excited,\u201d he said. A year ago, I wrote that Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill is the climate bill . Since then, that bill has been cut in two, renamed the Build Back Better Act, killed, resurrected, maybe killed again, and generally muddled over by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and the rest of the Senate Democratic caucus. Considerable controversy persists over what social-spending programs should go in the bill. But the climate and energy section has remained one of the most popular aspects of the bill\u2014and one policy that has, so far, stayed within Manchin\u2019s favor. \u201cI think that the climate thing is one that we probably can come to agreement much easier than anything else,\u201d he told reporters early last month. As you may know, the United States already has a set of policies that could be described as \u201cclean-energy tax credits,\u201d a mishmash of tax breaks for solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems. But they are overly specific and kind of a mess, written at different times by different legislators. The tax credit for solar, for instance, gives developers a break whenever they invest in  new solar capacity, while the wind tax credit gives them credit only when they produce a kilowatt-hour of wind power. They\u2019re also designed in such a way that big banks end up capturing a lot of their economic value. The new tax-credit scheme fixes those problems. The new tax credits are technology-neutral, allowing developers to use them when producing or investing in any kind of zero-carbon electricity (although they can\u2019t claim both for the same project). And the new credits\u2019 simpler design\u2014they\u2019re fully refundable\u2014should eliminate banks\u2019 overbearing role. The credits also\u00a0 include a few other tweaks that will make it easier for normal utilities, and not independent power producers that sell electricity to the highest bidder, to use them. These tweaks make the tax credits much more efficient than other policies. At their peak, the incentives would eliminate 33 to 45 percent of carbon emissions from the country\u2019s electricity sector, compared with a world without the policy, the analysis found. Because Biden\u2019s strategy for decarbonizing the American economy depends on zeroing out carbon pollution from the electricity grid first, carbon savings in the electricity sector propagate through the system. The cleaner the grid, for instance, the cleaner electric vehicles become. Under a conventional economic analysis, most of the government\u2019s existing climate policies cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars to prevent a single ton of carbon from entering the atmosphere. The existing solar tax credits, for instance, can effectively cost up to $2,218 to abate a ton of carbon pollution. The new policies will cost the public only $33 to $50 to prevent a ton of climate pollution from entering the atmosphere, which is well below economists\u2019 median estimate of how much each ton of carbon pollution costs the economy. \u201cMost of those other climate policies are just getting a small amount of tons,\u201d Greenstone said. \u201cBut this is a quite broad policy that would give you a lot of tons.\u201d That\u2019s in large part due to the huge collapse in the price of solar and wind, John Larsen , another co-author of the study and a partner at the Rhodium Group, told me. \u201cWind and solar are so cheap now and are projected to get even cheaper this decade. When you extend and enhance federal tax credits for a decade, it really leverages all this cheap tech in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible five or 10 years ago.\u201d That places the clean-energy tax incentives at an unusual sweet spot: Although they\u2019re normally explained as innovation policies, aimed at bringing down the cost of alternative and zero-carbon energy, they will also cheaply eliminate tons of carbon pollution. And because their per-ton cost is below the social cost of carbon, the tax credits may in some cases be more efficient than a carbon tax. Yet they seem unlikely to generate the political blowback that tends to greet a carbon tax. \u201cIt\u2019s cost effective, it gets a lot of tons, it gets at the sector that everyone says we have to get right the fastest\u2014and we can do it without the tools everyone said we needed,\u201d Larsen said. That sets a good precedent for the next time that Congress takes a look at the climate problem. \u201cPrior to 2021, the only way that people felt they could make big gains was with a comprehensive climate policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that there\u2019s a lot of ways to get points on the board with spending.\u201d In an email, Lynne Kiesling, an economist at the University of Colorado who was not involved in the study, agreed that the study found the tax credits may be cheaper than other policies. But she pointed out that the cost of paying for the policy isn\u2019t the necessarily the same as its dollar-and-cents efficiency. \u201cThe cost of financing the tax credits is likely to be the variable of the most concern, both for the policy itself and for its broader macroeconomic tax consequences,\u201d she said. Remarkably, the study may actually underestimate the public benefit of the tax breaks, Larsen added, because he and his colleagues did not include an estimate of the money saved in medical bills from reducing conventional toxic air pollution. During the Obama administration, the benefits of reducing this conventional air pollution often paid for climate policy by itself. \u201cTypically, the co-benefits of conventional pollutants are quite large\u2014they\u2019re usually of the same magnitude as the climate benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be dismissed.\u201d Society could reap the benefits of such a prosperous policy. But first, the bill has to pass .","headline":"Biden\u2019s Biggest Idea on Climate Change Is Remarkably Cheap","article_name":622027.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/bidens-biggest-idea-on-climate-change-is-remarkably-cheap-tax-credits\/622027\/","date_published":"2022-02-09 14:27:32","article_length":7411,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:58.458829","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/bidens-biggest-idea-on-climate-change-is-remarkably-cheap-tax-credits\/622027\/","source":"atlantic"}

In a landmark report, a global panel of leading scientists again called the evidence for climate change \u201cunequivocal\u201d and for the first time said humans are \u201cextremely likely\u201d to be the dominant cause. Put simply: \u201cHuman influence on the climate is clear.\u201d And as this map makes clear, the world has already experienced warming of up to 2.5\u00b0C over nearly its entire surface since the start of the 20th century: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is convened by the United Nations to give periodic updates on the state of climate science as well as future projections and likely impacts. The group was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their last update in 2007. What makes the IPCC so important is simple: They are required to agree. Last night, the group pulled an all-nighter to ensure that representatives from\u00a0all 195 member countries agreed on\u00a0 every single word \u00a0of the 36-page \u201c summary for policymakers \u201d (pdf). That instantly makes the report the world\u2019s scientific and political authority on what is happening to the climate, what will happen in the future, and what needs to be done to avoid the worst impacts. Here is the report\u2019s side-by-side comparison of the best-case and worst-case scenarios for global climate change in the 21st century. The scenario on the left assumes drastic and immediate global reductions in fossil fuel usage; the right assumes \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d just continues. On the right, runaway climate change causes warming of more than 10\u00b0C in some regions, extreme rainfall and droughts become the norm, the Arctic becomes ice-free in the summer, and the ocean becomes much more acidic: Some other important takeaways from the new document: \u2022\u00a0Between 1901\u20132012, \u201calmost the entire globe has experienced\u00a0 surface warming \u2026\u00a0Each of the last three decades has been\u00a0 successively warmer \u00a0at the Earth\u2019s surface than any preceding decade since 1850.\u201d \u2022\u00a0\u201cThe rate of\u00a0 sea level rise since \u00a0the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia\u2026.\u00a0It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100.\u201d \u2022\u00a0\u201cAtmospheric concentrations of\u00a0 CO2, methane, and N2O \u00a0have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years\u2026.Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped.\u201d \u2022 \u201c Heat waves \u00a0are very likely to occur more frequently and last longer\u2026.\u00a0 Extreme precipitation events \u2026will very likely become more intense and more frequent by the end of this century.\u201d \u2022\u00a0\u201cA nearly\u00a0 ice-free Arctic Ocean \u00a0in September before mid-century is likely.\u201d \u2022 \u201cContinued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system\u2026.\u00a0Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained\u00a0 reductions of greenhouse gas emissions .\u201d For the first time, the report mentioned projections of climate change beyond 2100 and painted a picture of a bleak world, possibly unrecognizable to those living today, should fossil fuel use continue on its current trajectory. The report also raised a note of caution for the first time on the use of so-called \u201cgeoengineering technologies\u201d (such as\u00a0 solar shades \u00a0or\u00a0 carbon dioxide extraction via artificial trees ), which are being increasingly considered as last-ditch efforts to neutralize some of the impacts of climate change. Also concerning was the report\u2019s insistence on new evidence showing a strengthened link between man-made climate change and extreme weather events, particularly heat waves, droughts, and floods. Such extreme weather events cost the United States $110 billion in 2012, most notably from Hurricane Sandy, which brought record coastal flooding to New York City\u2014a portion of which has been\u00a0 linked to global sea level rise . According to the report, the world can emit about 300 gigatons more carbon (total, ever)\u00a0before there is a 50 percent\u00a0confidence the world will reach warming of 2 degrees Celsius, which is the previously agreed upon \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for the climate system. For reference, 531 gigatons was emitted from 1870 to 2011. On a continued \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectory, the world will burn through about 5 times that safety limit by 2100, putting the world on a path for warming of more than 4.5 degrees Celsius and about a meter of additional sea level rise. This idea of a \u2018global carbon budget\u2019 \u2014 a precursor to a possible global price on carbon emissions \u2014 was endorsed by the group for the first time. Without jumping up and down on the desks of their computer terminals, this forum of scientists has done about as much as they can do. With this report, they have proven humankind\u2019s impact on the climate, and confidently projected dire consequences should world governments fail to act immediately. To help put the report\u2019s results in a human context, the Guardian has\u00a0 created an interactive \u00a0that calculates how much climate change you will experience in your lifetime. The full report, due out next week, will total roughly 2,500 pages.","headline":"We Are Terrifyingly Close to the Climate's 'Point of No Return'","article_name":280076.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/09\/we-are-terrifyingly-close-to-the-climates-point-of-no-return\/280076\/","date_published":"2013-09-27 19:16:00","article_length":5151,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:58:59.602408","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/09\/we-are-terrifyingly-close-to-the-climates-point-of-no-return\/280076\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Two new reports highlight the alarming consequences of staying our current course. Two new reports highlight the alarming consequences of staying our current course. Two major organizations released climate change reports this month warning of doom and gloom if we stick to our current course and fail to take more aggressive measures. A World Bank report imagines a world 4 degrees warmer, the temperature predicted by century's end barring changes, and says it aims to shock people into action by sharing devastating scenarios of flood, famine, drought and cyclones. Meanwhile, a report from the US National Research Council, commissioned by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other intelligence agencies, says the consequences of climate change--rising sea levels, severe flooding, droughts, fires, and insect infestations--pose threats greater than those from terrorism ranging from massive food shortages to a rise in armed conflicts. Here are some of the more alarming graphic images from the reports. 1. Most of Greenland's top ice layer melted in four days These shots published in the World Bank report show an unusually large ice melt over a four-day period, when an estimated 97% of Greenland's surface ice sheet had thawed by the middle of July 2012. Normally, ice sheets melt around the outer margins first where elevation is lower and allow for warmer temperatures. The event is uncommon, though not unprecedented. A similar event happened in 1889, and before that, several centuries earlier. There are indications, however, that the greatest amount of melting during the past 225 years has occurred in the last decade. 2. America just had its worst drought in over 50 years This past summer, the US experienced its worst drought in more than a half a century--severely reducing farm yields, livestock production, and raising food prices globally. The World Bank shared this snapshot of drought conditions covering some 63% of the contiguous US on Aug. 28, 2012. Serious droughts have hit the US in the 1950s and the 1930s, with some areas experiencing worse drought than during the dust bowl. (The reason we're not experiencing Dust Bowl II is thanks to better soil management practices.) Studies suggest we should expect severe and widespread droughts over the next few decades, if not longer, thanks to global warming. 3. Coral reefs are doomed Coral reefs, which protect against coastal flooding, storm surges, wave damage, and also provide homes for lots of fish, are doomed on our current course, says the World Bank. Coral reefs are dissolving because of ocean acidification--the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more gets dissolved in the oceans. The illustration shows the impact on coral reefs at various CO2 levels. Coral reefs may stop growing as CO2 concentration levels approach 450 ppm, which is expected over the coming decades. By the time the concentration reaches around 550 ppm in the 2060s, coral reefs will start to dissolve. 4. Wildfires are multiplying This map published in the National Research Council report shows how rising temperatures and increased evaporation will cause widespread fires in the western US. Fire damage in the northern Rocky Mountain forests, marked by region B, is expected to more than double annually for each 1.8 degree Fahrenheit increase in average global temperatures. With the same temperature increase, fire damage in the Colorado Rockies (region J) is expected to be more than seven times what it was in the second half of the 20th century. 5. Civil wars on the rise In 2011, the world witnessed a spike in the number of active conflicts, rising to 37 from 31 in 2010. It was the largest increase between any two years since 1990--though still below the peak of 53 active conflicts in the early post-Cold War years. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in conflicts in Africa, and also to events tied to the Arab Spring. There's conflicting evidence about whether climate change causes increasing violence, though one study found that between the years 1000 and 1900, low temperatures in Europe coincided with an elevated risk of interstate war. Over the long term, the theory is that climate-related problems such as water shortages will lead not to wars across borders, but rather to violent conflicts within states. Finally, this last one is not a chart, but if talk of climate change and how it all works is baffling, here's a helpful video that explains it well:","headline":"5 Charts About Climate Change That Should Have You Very, Very Worried","article_name":265554.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/11\/5-charts-about-climate-change-that-should-have-you-very-very-worried\/265554\/","date_published":"2012-11-24 15:11:04","article_length":4458,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:00.009718","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/11\/5-charts-about-climate-change-that-should-have-you-very-very-worried\/265554\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Saudi leaders have figured out what makes the president tick like few others have. T he joke, a throwaway quip , somehow captured the man and the moment\u2014the end of one era, and the beginning of another. It was January 2017, and then\u2013British Prime Minister Theresa May was in the White House, the first foreign leader to visit the new president of the United States, Donald Trump. For May, the trip had gone well: Pleasantries had been exchanged, faux pas avoided, commitments to NATO and the special relationship gleaned. Then came the press conference. \u201cMr. President,\u201d the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, called on by May, began, \u201cyou\u2019ve said before that torture works; you\u2019ve praised Russia; you\u2019ve said you want to ban some Muslims from coming to America; you\u2019ve suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and are worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\u201d A momentary silence followed. Smiling, Trump turned to his guest: \u201cThis was your choice of a question?\u201d The room burst into laughter. Then came the punch line: \u201cThere goes that relationship.\u201d Trump\u2019s remark may have been lighthearted, but it was also revealing: Here was a man who did not behave like a normal politician. He was unpredictable, uncontrollable, wild, and sometimes, yes, even funny. And yet he had an unmistakable streak of malice. Given the chance to ad-lib, Trump had joked that all it took was a tough question and the special relationship was off. It was funny because it pierced the tension in the room, but also because there was a ring of truth to it. Every world leader since has faced the same problem: How do you handle a man like Trump? Britain, with its special relationship and deep connections to the U.S., seemed particularly well suited to the game at hand, given the new president\u2019s support for Brexit and his familial connection to Scotland through his mother. Yet the story of his presidency has been one of British diplomatic failure , not success. Years of directionless prevaricating in London were compounded by a turgid, inflexible, and unimaginative diplomatic effort in Washington. The result: Britain has achieved little of substance\u2014whether on trade, Iran, the climate, or Russia. Since May\u2019s visit, Britain\u2019s influence in Washington has slumped. But a few countries have made significant diplomatic gains over the course of the Trump presidency\u2014Israel, Saudi Arabia, India, and North Korea among them\u2014by working with the president, his family, and friends in ways the European powers have not. Read: Trump Has Launched a Three-Pronged Attack on the Election To understand who played the Great Trump Game well and what lessons can be drawn from their success, we spoke with more than a dozen current and former diplomats and officials in the U.S. and abroad, some who are still serving, others retired. Many of those we interviewed have worked directly with Trump and his administration, and the majority asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly. We also spoke with foreign-policy analysts, politicians, and political aides on both sides of the Atlantic to understand the long-term implications of Trump\u2019s time in office. While the picture that emerges is a patchwork quilt of seemingly random American diplomatic achievements and failures, at least one clear pattern can be discerned: Hard men\u2014they were all men\u2014and dictators with deals to strike did well; Europeans who rely on history, democratic traditions, values, and strategic alliances did badly. To get ahead in Trump\u2019s Washington, the lesson for other countries\u2019 leaders and diplomats is clear: You need to have something to sell and the connections to sell it. Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu had a direct line to the president and used it\u2014Trump\u2019s decision to move the American embassy to Jerusalem was a major victory. Saudi Arabia has similarly close ties to the Trump family through the president\u2019s son-in-law and do-it-all adviser Jared Kushner and reaped the rewards, despite being caught decapitating and dismembering a Washington Post journalist. India has been \u201cmasterful\u201d in its diplomatic strategy, according to one admiring diplomat, culminating in Narendra Modi\u2019s trip to Texas last year and Trump\u2019s state visit to Delhi in February. Turkey emerged with significant geopolitical gains in Syria, while North Korea has won previously undreamed-of status without giving away anything in return. Of America\u2019s obvious adversaries, Russia remains the conundrum through its inexplicable hold over Trump. Russian President Vladimir Putin has managed to win favor without the fawning demanded of other states. And the only real strategic rival to U.S. hegemony\u2014China\u2014has suffered relentless criticism from the Republican Party, and at times become a lightning rod for the president\u2019s animosity, but has continued to rise nonetheless. The problem for old American allies such as Britain, France, Germany, and even Australia, according to those who have worked closely with Trump, is that the president sees international relations as a series of business deals in which there are winners and losers. In his world, strategy, alliances, and values mean little. One former White House official told The Atlantic that Trump\u2019s weakness is that his only yardstick is money. \u201cPart of the reason for that is he\u2019s absolutely, totally unaware of history,\u201d this former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to candidly relate private deliberations. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, for example, why the Korean War happened, why there was an armistice.\u201d Privately, the former official continued, Trump would question what had happened in the two world wars and why the U.S. military maintained permanent bases in Europe. Read: I nside the Collapse of Trump\u2019s Korea Policy \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a strategic vision at all. If it\u2019s anything, it\u2019s to have other countries pay\u2014plus 50 percent.\u201d According to the former official, Trump sees in autocratic leaders such as Putin, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and China\u2019s Xi Jinping\u2014as Trump would put it\u2014\u201ckiller business guys like me.\u201d I n the Trump storm , the structures of American power, such as the professional foreign-policy apparatus, have been blown away. In their place, personality, politics, family, and money have come to the fore. \u201cWhat Trump basically did was emasculate the rest of the diplomatic corps and all the elements of the U.S. government, so that everybody has to talk to Trump if they really want to know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Victor Cha, a Georgetown University professor and\u00a0 former national-security official under President George W. Bush, told us in an interview. Some countries have thrived in this environment; many others have had to make do with surviving. Among those that managed to succeed, a pattern largely holds: You need an autocratic leader, a close connection to the Trump family, or a deal the president can hail as a victory. Ideally, you have all three. Perhaps the best example of this is Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe Saudis are doing business with us the way people do business with the Saudis,\u201d Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and an official in the Reagan and both Bush administrations, told us. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Okay, the United States has become like us. It\u2019s being run by a family. So we will deal with the family.\u2019\u201d Trump was an early fan of Saudi Arabia. He made Riyadh his first foreign stop as president and his hosts pampered him, projecting a five-story image of him onto the hotel where he stayed and presenting him with a gold medallion that is the country\u2019s highest civilian honor. Not even the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was enough to deter a president focused on future deals. By then, Kushner was already close to the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And in a statement largely absolving the Saudis of the Khashoggi killing, Trump explicitly referenced the $450 billion the kingdom had \u201cagreed to spend and invest\u201d in the U.S., including a sum on military equipment. Autocracy. Familial ties. Business deals. For Israel, too, an early bet on Trump has paid off. \u201cOnce it became clear that the Palestinian issue was going to be run out of the White House and the secretary of state would have nothing to do with it, [Netanyahu], who already had a relationship with Jared, essentially works the White House,\u201d said Haass, author of The World: A Brief Introduction , published this year. \u201cIt\u2019s the deinstitutionalization of foreign policy. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here.\u201d Israel is by no measure an autocracy, yet it meets the other two criteria\u2014family ties and dealmaking: Netanyahu is an old friend of the Kushner family, who once slept in Kushner\u2019s bedroom during a visit to New Jersey (leaving Jared to sleep in the basement). The Israeli leader also succeeded in persuading Trump to move the American embassy, and indulged Trump\u2019s futile effort to strike \u201cthe deal of the century\u201d\u2014a Middle East peace plan. After its release in January, the proposal was immediately rejected by Palestinian leaders who saw it as too favorable to Israel, and since then it has mostly been ignored. Uri Friedman: What Democrats Aren\u2019t Admitting About Trump\u2019s Record Cha told us that world leaders who had done well for their country in the Trump era had discovered that some combination of these attributes was ripe for potential rewards, and many had arrived at the same strategy: Dress up your own national agenda as Trump\u2019s and give the president all the credit for what you wanted in the first place. The Japanese, South Koreans, and North Koreans have been particularly adept at this game, Cha said. (The notable exception to this trend is Mexico, which has consistently found itself under attack from the White House, but did not pay for a wall it didn\u2019t want, and whose president had a largely controversy-free visit to Washington in July.) A second former senior White House official said the importance of personal connections to the president was perhaps the key difference between prior administrations and Trump\u2019s. \u201cThe Emiratis, the Saudis, and particularly the Israelis were very adept at cultivating those relationships,\u201d this former official said. \u201cThe joke is that the U.S. ambassador to Israel doesn\u2019t have a role, because the prime minister can go directly to Washington for everything.\u201d In Washington, the extent to which Trump\u2019s family inserted itself into foreign policy was a source of frustration to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others. Tillerson once entered a restaurant in Washington, D.C., and the proprietor came over to tell him that his Mexican counterpart, Luis Videgaray, was also dining there. When Tillerson walked over to say hello, he found Kushner sitting at the same table. \u201cI could see the color go out of\u201d Videgaray\u2019s face, Tillerson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAs it turned out later,\u201d Tillerson continued, \u201cthe foreign secretary was operating on the assumption that everything he was talking to Mr. Kushner about had been run through the State Department and that I was fully on board with it. And he was rather shocked to find out that when he started telling me all these things that were news to me, I told him, \u2018This is the first time I\u2019m hearing of it.\u2019\u201d The first former White House official, meanwhile, recalled a meeting in Buenos Aires in 2018, during which Trump told Xi that Kushner would be involved in trade negotiations between the two countries. \u201cI tell you,\u201d this ex-official said, \u201cthey (the Chinese) brightened up, because they knew they could work him.\u201d Over the course of this presidency, many foreign capitals appear to have realized how dependent they were on the whims of Trump\u2019s temper or their ability to work family networks, and thus have sought strategies to hedge their bets with other centers of American power and influence, principally Congress. U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, told us in an interview that he had been getting lots of attention and requests for meetings in the Trump era. \u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable three years, and the list is long of ambassadors trying to get in to see me and have conversations to try to move the needle,\u201d Coons said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for stability and reassurance in these relationships that have gone on for decades and are foundational to our security and prosperity.\u201d Precisely that kind of decades-long foundational relationship is what European allies had long depended on, and the reliance on those strategic ties appears to have been their undoing during this administration. None of Europe\u2019s biggest countries had expected a Trump victory. The second ex\u2013White House official said that, more than most, Britain, France, and Germany had sought to intensify their efforts with Congress because of the limited headway they were making with Trump, particularly in preserving the Iranian nuclear deal and avoiding the imposition of tariffs. Congress was the only avenue left because making progress with the Trump administration was so difficult, Cha told us. Read: C ongress has lost its power over Trump The problem for traditional U.S. allies\u2014Britain, France, and Germany, but also Japan and Australia\u2014is that, unlike the quick hit of a diplomatic breakthrough with Trump, building support in Congress is slow. F or European powers , the trials and tribulations of the Trump era offer a salutary lesson in international relations: National interest remains king. While Trump has been explicit in this transactional view, showing little interest in notions of shared values or enduring alliances forged after the Second World War, in many respects his outlook is just a more extreme (and, so far, glaringly unsuccessful) version of that pursued by all U.S. presidents. Even at the height of the Anglo-American alliance during the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt coldly pursued American national interest in the struggle against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt\u2019s successor, Harry Truman, quickly sidelined Britain after the war to deal directly with Moscow, reflecting the new reality of the world. Soon after, Dwight Eisenhower, the hero of D-Day, left Britain in the lurch in Suez in 1956, before John F. Kennedy canceled a missile program seen as vital to Britain\u2019s national security, leading to vitriolic British headlines about the president\u2019s Irish heritage. Those would find an unlikely echo almost six decades later when Boris Johnson, then not yet prime minister, accused Barack Obama of harboring an ancestral dislike for Britain because of his Kenyan father. Today, in British diplomatic circles, the changing demographic makeup of the U.S. is cited as a challenge, as the old elite ties that once bound Washington and London have been replaced by a more diverse America\u2019s new connections to Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere. For Britain, though, such concerns are little more than a fig leaf to cover underlying tensions. As early as 1950 , U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, whose father was English, ordered officials to stop talking about a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Britain, arguing the term gave the false impression that it trumped other alliances. This is not, then, the first time that Britain\u2019s influence in Washington\u2014indeed, like any other state\u2014has rested on its own short-term strength and usefulness. Ties at the highest level improved when Tony Blair stood alongside Bush during the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, whereas in the two decades since, Britain\u2019s willingness to engage on the world stage (and thus its usefulness) has deteriorated. Trump\u2019s bellicosity may have spooked European states, including Britain, whose security is dependent on American goodwill and support, but according to those we spoke with, the past three years have only emphasized the structural problem Europe\u2019s premier powers already faced. Ultimately, these countries cannot expect to continue wielding special influence in Washington if they do not offer special benefits to the U.S. in return. And on this score, Europe\u2019s worth to Washington has been deteriorating as the principal strategic threat to American interests moves away from Europe\u2019s borders to the South China Sea. No talk about history, kinship, shared values, or the rules-based international order can hide this reality. David Frum: Trump has lost the plot One British official said a number of core diplomatic challenges for London would continue beyond 2020, whatever happened in the presidential election. Unless the country addresses its shrinking military capacity and its perceived unreliability as a foreign-policy and security partner, Britain\u2019s influence will continue to suffer. The official said Britain needs to be more assertive about what it brings to the table, and to acknowledge that it remains overwhelmingly in Britain\u2019s national interest for the U.S. to remain the preeminent global power\u2014not China. But to begin with, this official said, London needs to be honest about the damage its military cuts have caused. The U.K.\u2019s failures in the Trump era are symptomatic of a deeper malaise in its foreign policy, according to conversations with multiple influential British officials close to Johnson. In this view, Britain has struggled under Trump because its embassy has forgotten how to fight to be heard, and how to build a broad base of support in Congress and American society, while others such as India, Greece, Ireland, and Israel put great stock in their networks on the Hill and pulled ahead. The British embassy, we were told by two separate high-ranking and influential figures, has been too passive in its efforts for too long. Now overtaken, Britain faces the nightmare scenario of becoming associated with Trump, having desperately sought to win him over, in the eyes of a Democratic Party that may soon hold the keys to both the White House and Congress. As a result, Britain may soon find itself with an entirely new set of challenges, and the same set of core strategic weaknesses as before. European capitals, according to the first former White House official who spoke with us, have concluded that Trump is a \u201ccomplete aberration.\u201d The former official continued: \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018This is a one-off. There\u2019s not another man on the planet like this guy.\u2019 Consequently, when he leaves office, the Americans will rebuild these relationships.\u201d That may well be the case if Trump were to lose his bid for reelection in November, but what if he prevails? \u201cHe\u2019s done damage,\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who was ousted last year and went on to release a tell-all book , told us. \u201cAfter one term, the damage can be repaired fairly easily. What bothers me is the risk of a second term, where I think the damage may not be so easily repaired. And that could cause lasting harm, which is one reason I\u2019m not going to vote for him in November.\u201d Still, whether in 2020 or 2024, Trump will leave office at some point, and American foreign-policy making will continue. The Washington game is much longer than the presidency of one man. \u201cPersonal relationships are important,\u201d Antony Blinken, a senior foreign-policy adviser to the Biden campaign and a former foreign-policy official in the Obama administration, said, \u201cbut if they\u2019re the sum and substance of your foreign policy, you\u2019re going to have a problem.\u201d For the past three years, leaders, ambassadors, and kings have competed in the Great Trump Game for influence and favor. Deals have been made, egos burned, reputations burnished, careers trashed. Yet the underlying reality is that Trump did not change the nature of the game itself. In his pantomime mendacity, he managed to reveal what had been shrouded in politeness before: British weakness, European incoherence, and Chinese power. The president might have created new ways of winning and losing, but in the end he did not build a new world\u2014he exposed the nature of the one that already existed.","headline":"How to Stay One Step Ahead of Donald Trump","article_name":615139.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2020\/08\/donald-trump-foreign-policy\/615139\/","date_published":"2020-08-11 12:27:40","article_length":20117,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:00.954618","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2020\/08\/donald-trump-foreign-policy\/615139\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Both are excuses for inaction. There has been a subtle shift recently in the rhetoric of many conservative pundits and politicians around climate change. For decades, the common refrain has been flat-out denial\u2014either that climate change is not happening, or that any change is not caused by human activity. Which is why viewers might have been surprised to see Tucker Carlson of Fox News nodding along thoughtfully on January 6 as climate scientist Judith Curry, a controversial figure in climate science, explained, \u201cYes it\u2019s warming and yes humans contribute to it. Everybody agrees with that, and I\u2019m in the 98 percent [of scientists who agree].

What don\u2019t we know?\u201d This rhetorical stance\u2014yes, climate change is real, and yes, human activity is implicated, but we don\u2019t know how much human activity is to blame\u2014is fast becoming the go-to position for conservatives. In confirmation hearings last week, Senator Ed Markey asked Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, if he agrees with Trump that global warming is a \u201choax.\u201d Pruitt replied that he does not. But later, under questioning by Senator Bernie Sanders, Pruitt refused to say how much change is caused by human activity. He would say only that the \u201cclimate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner.\u201d When pressed by Sanders on whether he agreed with 97 percent of scientists who have published in peer-reviewed journals that human activity is \u201cthe fundamental reason we are seeing climate change,\u201d Pruitt equivocated. \u201cI believe the ability to measure with precision the degree of human activity\u2019s impact on the climate is subject to more debate.\u201d The key phrases in Pruitt\u2019s testimony are \u201cin some manner\u201d and \u201cwith precision.\u201d These allow Pruitt to acknowledge climate change is happening while moving uncertainty downstream, into the \u201cdetails.\u201d This rhetoric is out of step with the latest science. The most recent IPCC report expresses 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of most global warming observed since the 1950s. According to one paper summarized on NASA\u2019s Global Climate Change website, \u201c97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.\u201d The list of scientists and agencies in agreement goes on and on. Some conservatives have introduced uncertainty by suggesting climate change might be driven by \u201cnatural\u201d global cycles. But according to Maureen Raymo of Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, we know why climate changes naturally, and non-human activity can\u2019t explain the rapid changes observed in the past century. \u201cThe Ice Ages happen due to subtle changes in the sun-earth distance that unfold over thousands of years, and which can lead to sometimes rapid climate change, when thresholds are crossed.\u201d These cycles are still happening, but \u201cthe same factors that cause these huge Ice Age swings could not possibly be invoked to explain the warming we now see.\u201d In fact, Raymo said, \u201cleft to its own devices, right now Mother Nature would be making the climate colder.\u201d The planet has warmed by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century. \u201cYou can quibble about tiny bits,\u201d said Raymo, \u201cbut the vast majority of what we observe is that it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been combusting fossil fuels.\u201d As Gavin Schmidt, Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Principal Investigator for the GISS ModelE Earth System Model, put it, \u201cIn science, nothing is ever known perfectly. Is there remaining uncertainty in the exact value of gravity? Yes. But to something like the fourth decimal place. It doesn\u2019t matter . So the question is: Is the remaining uncertainty relevant to any policy decision anyone would want to make? And the answer is: no. \u201d Uncertainty has proved a reliable tool to manipulate public perception of climate change and stall political action. In 2015, the Union of Concerned Scientists released The Climate Deception Dossiers, which describes a 1998 memo from the American Petroleum Institute that, according to the dossiers, \u201cmapped out a multifaceted deception strategy for the fossil-fuel industry that continues to this day\u2014outlining plans to reach the media, the public, and policy makers with a message emphasizing \u2018uncertainties\u2019 in climate science.\u201d The UCS authors write that the memo (included in the report) states \u201cvictory\u201d would be achieved \u201cwhen \u2018average citizens\u2019 and the media were convinced of uncertainties in climate science despite overwhelming evidence of the impact of human-caused global warming and nearly unanimous agreement about it in the scientific community.\u201d Another \u201cvictory\u201d listed on the API memo\u2019s bullet-point list would be when, \u201cthose promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality.\u201d The new climate-denial rhetoric dovetails with longstanding tactics used by conservatives and fossil fuel companies to sow doubt about climate change, even as they publicly recognize its reality. In a 2006 Letter from ExxonMobil Vice President of Public Affairs Ken Cohen to the Royal Society, the corporation acknowledged that \u201cthe use of fossil fuels is a \u2018major source\u2019 of carbon dioxide emissions\u201d and tied emissions to climate change: \u201cGiven the important role fossil fuels play in providing energy for the global economy, the issues of global economic development, future energy supply, and climate change are closely linked.\u201d This past November, ExxonMobil even endorsed the Paris Agreement in a carefully-worded statement that balanced the need to reduce global emissions with the statement that, \u201caccess to affordable and reliable energy is critical to economic growth and improved standards of living worldwide.\u201d Despite this acknowledgement, ExxonMobil has, since November, launched a suite of massive extraction projects in Nigeria, Mozambique, Liberia and Texas. In his recent confirmation hearings, Rex Tillerson, ex-CEO of ExxonMobil and newly-minted U.S. Secretary of State, carefully avoided making any of the links that ExxonMobil\u2019s own scientists had made by the early 1980s between fossil fuels, rising greenhouse gases, and the ability of those gases to affect climate \u201cin potentially destructive ways.\u201d When asked to explain his \u201cpersonal view\u201d of climate change by Senator Tom Udall, Tillerson would say only that \u201cafter 20 years as an engineer and a scientist,\u201d he had concluded \u201cthe risk of climate change does exist,\u201d and \u201cthe consequences could be serious enough that action should be taken.\u201d Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then pointedly asked, \u201cDo you believe that human activity, based on science, is contributing?\u201d Tillerson dodged again, saying only, \u201cThe increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited.\u201d Tillerson can make statements like these because climate research is ongoing, and climate models are inherently imprecise. According to Schmidt, \u201cTo say that science isn\u2019t settled on things people are still researching is totally irrelevant. Does the earth orbit the sun? There\u2019s no substantial ambiguity about the answer to that question, despite the fact that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of scientists working on gravity. There are lots of interesting things about gravity, it\u2019s just that that is not one of them. There are lots of interesting things about climate change, and adaptation, and interactions between air pollution and clouds, but they\u2019re just not relevant to the question, which is: Is what\u2019s going on related to humans? And the answer is: Yes, it is .\u201d When Tillerson was pushed by Senator Tim Kaine to admit ExxonMobil\u2019s \u201chistory with the issue of climate change,\u201d including the oil giant\u2019s well-documented practice of funding work to discredit climate science and delay political action, he stonewalled until Kaine finally asked, \u201cAre you not answering because you don\u2019t know, or because you don\u2019t want to?\u201d To which Tillerson replied, \u201cA little of both.\u201d There has been a flurry of recent Republican efforts to stall action on climate policy, including a pair of bills just introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives. Bill H.R. 861, introduced by Representative Matt Gaetz, proposes \u201cto terminate the EPA.\u201d This bill may not even get a vote, but as The New York Times reported earlier this week, Pruitt \u201chas a blueprint to repeal climate change rules, cut staffing levels, close regional offices and permanently weaken the agency\u2019s regulatory authority.\u201d Meanwhile, Bill H.R. 673, introduced by Representative Blaine Luetkmeyer, proposes to \u201cprohibit United States contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Green Climate Fund.\u201d It\u2019s also no secret that many Republicans want to halt funding for the UN FCCC, the international treaty system of 195 nations that produced the Paris Agreement. As the Republican party platform stated in the run-up to the presidential election: \u201cWe reject the agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.\u201d On February 8, a cohort of old-guard Republicans came out in favor of a carbon tax, which they call a \u201cconservative approach to climate change.\u201d Rather than setting limits on emissions (as with cap-and-trade), a carbon tax would put a higher price on fossil fuel emissions and leave it to the market to curb emissions. This approach may be appealing to some voters, because as the tax slowly increases consumers receive increasing rebates. While this approach at least acknowledges that human use of fossil fuels is contributing to climate change, many experts argue this would not be a meaningful restriction, given the convulsive climate changes already under way. In September 2016, carbon-dioxide levels in the air crossed the dreaded 400 ppm threshold, and we are not likely to dip back below that level in our lifetimes. Crossing this red line signals an irrevocable shift toward an increasingly unrecognizable planet (the last time the planet\u2019s air was consistently above 400 ppm was 16 million years ago, and the planet looked a lot different). In just the past few months, we have seen record-breaking global temperatures and a stunning decline in sea ice. A slab of ice bigger than Long Island is poised to crack off the Antarctic\u2019s Larsen C ice shelf and the climate-stabilizing flow of the Gulf Stream, which has decreased by 20 percent \u00a0in the last 50 years, may be accelerating toward full shut-down. According to the Pentagon\u2019s 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap, climate change will cause catastrophic changes to Earth\u2019s ecosystems and wreak havoc on human populations, including famine, mass migration, and war. A carbon tax may be too little, too late, but even it would be preferable to rhetoric that fails to acknowledge scientific consensus on climate change. The recent shift in conservative rhetoric exploits legitimate scientific uncertainty that most scientists agree is irrelevant to crafting responsible climate policy. Despite overwhelming evidence, many conservatives are still willing to ignore scientific consensus and stall political action. But offering evidence that this rhetoric is out of step with science may not, in fact, matter when it comes to public perception. When the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology published a press release on February 5, alleging that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \u201cmanipulated climate records,\u201d scientists and journalists rushed to correct the statement and demonstrate how it was based on faulty information. But the damage was already done; uncertainty about NOAA and their data are now a part of the public dialogue around climate change.","headline":"How the New Climate Denial Is Like the Old Climate Denial","article_name":516198.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/the-new-rhetoric-of-climate-denial\/516198\/","date_published":"2017-02-10 12:00:00","article_length":12048,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:01.321370","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/02\/the-new-rhetoric-of-climate-denial\/516198\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The thick layer of mucilage that covered the Sea of Marmara for weeks was an unsettling glimpse of climate change\u2019s more oozy effects. M y first sight of it came one morning in June, as I rode the ferry through the Bosporus strait: a toxic glint on the sea\u2019s surface. I initially thought it was oil, spilled from one of the many large container ships that pass through Istanbul via the Bosporus. Yet as we neared the glint, a sallow sludge marbled the water around the boat. In some areas, it was as thick and buoyant as fiberglass insulation. Its surface, coated with foamy bubbles and viscous puddles, was littered with balloons, bread crusts, and Styrofoam food containers. It\u2019s called marine mucilage, but the world knows it better as \u201csea snot,\u201d thanks to the tsunami of stories that went viral when it overtook the Sea of Marmara in May. The internet marveled at the mess and moved on, but here in Istanbul, the sea snot hijacked the summer. Its unearthly, unavoidable presence closed down beaches and dominated conversations. For some of us, it was more profoundly unsettling. This isn\u2019t what I imagined global warming would look like. I was braced for bigger wildfires and rising seas; I wasn\u2019t ready for sea snot. If the story of the Sea of Marmara in the summer of 2021 is a preview of what\u2019s to come, the effects of climate change will be not only terrifyingly destructive but also weird, uncomfortable, and unbearably gross. T he Marmara is a historic inland sea that connects the Black Sea with the Aegean via the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. Along its shores, which are rimmed with ports, piers, summer houses, and factories, fishermen in wooden boats still haul in sea bass, mullet, and anchovies. But over the past decade, marine species such as bluefin tuna and swordfish have gone commercially extinct, populations of many other fish species have declined, and jellyfish have mobbed the coastline, all symptoms of an ailing ecosystem. The mean surface temperature of the Marmara, like that of many seas, is rising due to climate change, but the Marmara\u2019s has increased by 2.5 degrees Celsius\u20141.5 degrees more than the global average, making it a leading indicator for seas around the world. This intense warming, along with decades of abuse from pollution and overfishing, sent the Marmara into a state of maritime shock. At the end of 2020, increased concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen led to a boom in phytoplankton , single-celled organisms whose name means \u201cplant drifter\u201d in Greek. The Marmara\u2019s warming surface temperature also caused its waters to stratify, slowing the currents that would normally help disrupt algae growth. Eventually, the phytoplankton began to run out of nutrients, causing the cells of some species to exude a sticky substance. As these cells died, they collided and stuck together, aggregating into globs that hovered in the warmest layer of the stratified water. With time and exposure, the globs turned into a submerged mat of mucus that trapped nearly everything around it\u2014bacteria, fish larvae, dead cells, debris. Bacteria thrived on the dead phytoplankton, adding to the mat\u2019s mass. \u201cAt that point, it takes on a life of its own,\u201d Mustafa Yucel, a marine-science professor at Middle East Technical University\u2019s Institute of Marine Science, told me. With increasing water temperatures, he said, we should prepare to see more extreme reactions in our seas\u2014including invasive-species outbreaks and massive algal and seaweed blooms. The fisherman Roy Oksen, the chief of one of Istanbul\u2019s fishing cooperatives, remembers the first time he couldn\u2019t pull his fishing net into his boat. Something was weighing it down. He asked a shipmate for help, and together they hoisted the net out of the water. Instead of fish, it was full of a dark, slippery goo. Soon, he told me, the mucilage was clogging not only nets but also boat motors. I met Oksen at his fishing co-op\u2019s headquarters, a harborside hut where we sipped tea surrounded by coiled ropes and the smell of bait and petrol. The window, which usually provided a view of the water, was plastered with flyers stating that seafood from the Marmara was safe to eat despite the mucilage. Oksen explained that a fish that would have sold for 50 lira before the sea-snot outbreak would now sell for just 10, even as he was working harder to catch fewer of them. To make matters worse, news of the outbreak had led to a 70 percent drop in fish sales in cities around the Marmara. The equipment problems ultimately got so bad that Oksen and other fishermen were forced to end their season early. \u201cIf this continues this year or next year, I\u2019ll have to go look for a new kind of job to survive,\u201d he said. A s the mucilage drifted below the surface, it started to rot, beginning a nasty metamorphosis. The decay was spurred by viruses and bacteria that multiplied in the mucus and ruptured the dead phytoplankton cells, causing them to release more mucus and gas. As the gas inflated the mucilage, it began to rise. In May, it broke the surface of the Marmara, making its grand entrance into the public eye. It pooled in the shallow bays near Gebze, haunted the harbors around Erdek, and flourished on the shores of Istanbul\u2019s tony Princes\u2019 Islands. Kad\u0131k\u00f6y smelled like rotten eggs. Headlines about the sea-snot outbreak went viral, and the world recoiled in disgust. In early June, I went to Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, a trendy neighborhood on the Asian side of Istanbul that had been hit hard by the outbreak. Some of the mucilage mats were as thick and dense as a \u201970s shag rug; others were light and frothy, like a frappuccino. On a normal summer day at the Kalami\u015f Marina, one of Turkey\u2019s poshest, yachts glide in and out of their slips, whisking people to the Princes\u2019 Islands or on a sunset cruise. When mucilage arrived at the marina, staff laid an orange oil-spill boom in the water in an attempt to hold it off. But it quickly overcame the boom, and soon the marina\u2019s waters were carpeted with mucilage. Yachts were imprisoned in sea snot. Swarms of flies clustered around the mucilage, menacing the sailors. People no longer wanted to be near the water, Nail Bakt\u0131r, who runs a sailing school in the marina, told me. As he stood on the deck of his docked boat, he pointed to the scum rimming its hull. When he first saw the mucilage, he thought that the masses were the corpses of microorganisms from deep within the sea. \u201cWe\u2019re done. The Marmara Sea is over. The bodies are floating.\u201d His blunt conclusion: \u201cWe killed the Marmara.\u201d As Bakt\u0131r alternated between gripping the boat\u2019s wheel and stroking his long captain\u2019s beard, he said that although he had spent his whole life in Istanbul, the mucilage was making him consider a move to southern Turkey, where the water is cleaner. Maybe, he said, his grandchildren will see the Marmara the way it was when he was a child\u2014if environmental concerns are taken more seriously in the future. Meanwhile, the bacteria in the mucilage degraded, releasing enough gas to inflate small surface bubbles, ballooning the mucilage into conglomerates that scientists call \u201cclouds.\u201d With the clouds acting as sails, Turkey\u2019s fierce westerly lodos pushed the mucilage around the Marmara. Some flocs\u2014as loosely clumped masses of mucilage are called\u2014sailed all the way to Greece, raising concerns about the international spread of bacteria and viruses (none of my sources was aware of any reports of illness directly attributed to the mucilage). As I left the marina, I passed a team of municipal workers wearing life vests over Aegean-blue shirts, spooning the sea snot out of the water with what looked like pool skimmers. Scoop by scoop, they ladled globs of mucilage into garbage bags, then tied the bags and tossed them into a truck bound for an incineration center. Elsewhere on the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y seafront, more oil-spill booms temporarily corralled the mucilage so that it could be siphoned up by trucks with high-suction vacuums. Municipal cleaning boats puttered through the water, collecting solidified mucilage with the help of conveyor belts meant for clearing litter. The efforts seemed well intentioned but Sisyphean; the phenomenon was unprecedented, and the infrastructure to handle it nonexistent. F or more than a century , the Princes\u2019 Islands have served Istanbul\u2019s bourgeois as a refuge from the pollution and other unpleasantries of the megalopolis. People navigate the car-free archipelago by foot or carriage, passing neoclassical vacation homes old enough to have housed the likes of Leon Trotsky. Yet on a cloudless, 80-degree day in July, the islands\u2019 beaches sat empty. In one cove, lounge chairs stood in neat, colorful rows, but no one lay in them. The sand was unmarked by footprints. Just offshore, mucilage swirled like the contents of a witch\u2019s cauldron. According to Ay\u015fen Erdin\u00e7ler, an environmental-science professor at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University and the head of Istanbul\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection and Development, the risk of contracting a bacteria-borne illness from swimming increases 12 to 18 times when concentrated mucilage is present. As in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, municipal vessels chugged through the snot, endeavoring to suck it up with industrial hoses. Pedestrians paused and glared at the scene, brows furrowed. Tourists scurried by with masks on their faces and cameras around their necks. One woman tsk -ed; another covered her mouth and nose, disgusted by the sight or smell or both. This time it wasn\u2019t the mucilage itself that struck me\u2014desensitization had kicked in\u2014but the surreality of a summer without swimming. Our summer had become a Ren\u00e9 Magritte painting, a collision of ordinary objects producing an unfamiliar whole. \u201cEverything we see hides another thing,\u201d Magritte once said, and as I watched the mucus curdle in the water, I wondered what else it veiled. Some people stood at the water\u2019s edge in their swim trunks, either debating their options or persisting in denial. Some beach-club owners, desperate to put patrons at ease, baptized themselves in the now-umber water, reemerging with proclamations such as \u201cSee, nothing happened to me! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Whether or not this demonstration reassured people of the water\u2019s safety, they wearied of the heat, and soon they were creeping back to the shoreline. One miserably hot and humid Saturday, I sat on the edge of a dock in the islands, contemplating my first swim since the outbreak had begun. It was Turkey\u2019s second-hottest July on record since 1971, and the prospect of swimming in the sea was seductive. Besides, the mucilage was no longer floating in chunky continents, as it had in June; it had become lighter and creamier, the shade of a caf\u00e9 au lait. I had swum in murky waters before, I told myself\u2014in stagnant Sierra lakes at summer camp, and in the bogs of the Mekong River. I watched some friends lower themselves into the water nearby, cooling their bodies while straining their necks to keep their heads well above the water. But as a little blob of mucilage circled my feet, my stomach churned and my body froze. The pleasures of the sea were still just out of reach. Longing to reunite with the water, I remembered a scene in Orhan Pamuk\u2019s novel The Museum of Innocence in which a character backstrokes in the Marmara to cure his lovesickness. What\u2019s lost when we lose touch with our environment\u2014when a place we turn to for solace or enjoyment is suddenly inaccessible? I knew that the Nobel Prize\u2013winning author, like his character, is an avid swimmer, so I called him to ask how he had been affected by the outbreak. \u201cWhen I swim, I am a better thinker, that\u2019s for sure, and also my psychology changes\u2014it gives me some kind of self-confidence,\u201d he told me. \u201cSwimming takes me from a relatively depressive mood to a relatively creative mood.\u201d He went on to observe that this summer, swimming was the new smoking\u2014people avoided the mucilage as if it were carcinogenic. \u201cPeople are so psychologically scared of this ugly mucilage,\u201d he said. He imagined them on their balconies, watching him swim: \u201cIt is the serious novelist Orhan Pamuk!\u201d L ike many environmental disasters , the mucilage outbreak was the sudden consequence of several long-term trends. To better understand them, I took a train from Istanbul two hours east to the Gulf of \u0130zmit. Behind a manicured waterfront of willow trees and park benches, a defunct paper factory testifies to the area\u2019s industrial roots: A century ago, some of Turkey\u2019s first factories produced military uniforms and fezzes here. Today, the gulf remains the industrial heart of Turkey. Ford and Goodyear operate factories here, as do many chemical and fertilizer plants, all making use of the five ports and 35 industrial docks. Hakan Osanmaz, an environmental-inspection seaplane pilot based in the gulf, had promised to give me a new perspective on the Marmara. We sat in a stuffy prefab office by a dock, lined with photos from Osanmaz\u2019s years jetting tourists around the Mediterranean coast. He wore a tie-dyed Nirvana T-shirt, and he ruminated on the changes he\u2019d seen in the Marmara during his 15 years of bird\u2019s-eye views. The water was once so blue that \u201cit used to look like the Maldives here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the sea is throwing up. It\u2019s a catastrophe.\u201d Usually, Osanmaz\u2019s job is to document illegal waste dumping for the local municipality, but since the outbreak, it\u2019s also meant organizing a WhatsApp group to orchestrate the municipality\u2019s mucilage-cleanup efforts. The sky offers a different perspective on the outbreak. From Osanmaz\u2019s plane, I could see how monstrous Istanbul had grown. Over the past 50 years, the city has spread east along the Marmara, filling its coast with tract homes and high-rise condos, five-star hotels and office complexes. Twenty-five million people, along with half of Turkey\u2019s industry, inhabit the area around the Marmara, and their waste adds to the sea\u2019s burden. Meanwhile, dozens of rivers and streams carry waste into the Marmara. Some of the pollution comes from as far away as Western Europe via the Danube, which empties into the Black Sea and then flows into the Marmara. Osanmaz regularly documents illegal dumping of sewage by international ships passing through the sea. The ways in which wastewater is treated, it turns out, play an important role in preventing mucilage outbreaks. \u201cAmong the sources of marine pollution, 53% of the water coming to the Marmara Basin is discharged into the sea with only pre-treatment, that is to say by discharging the waste water in the houses only by passing it through sand filters and precipitation,\u201d Ay\u015fen Erdin\u00e7ler, the environmental-science professor, later told me in an email. Advanced water-treatment plants, she said, would remove more of the phosphorus and nitrogen that make mucilage outbreaks more likely, and would also allow the water to reoxygenate. As part of the Marmara Sea Action Plan, established by the Turkish government in response to the outbreak, existing wastewater-treatment plants are being upgraded and new ones are expected to be built within three years. O ne day in July , the mucilage suddenly disappeared. Istanbul woke to a sparkling sea. People flooded the shoreline, convinced that the nightmare was over. I called Alice Alldredge, an emeritus marine-biology professor at UC Santa Barbara, to ask what could have happened. \u201cIt most likely sank,\u201d she told me. Scientists aren\u2019t sure exactly why, but every once in a while, mucilage mats will just drop back below the water\u2019s surface. To follow the fate of the mucilage, I reached out to Ser\u00e7o Ek\u015fiyan, who has been diving in the Sea of Marmara for half a century. We sat in his wooden boat, which he had bought used and restored, as it bobbed in its slip at a derelict fishing harbor. His dives have always had a purpose: As a teenager, he went spearfishing to sell fish to restaurants; later, he spent years clearing abandoned nets from the sea and transplanting threatened coral to a marine reserve that he helped establish. I asked him if the mucilage had really sunk. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he said. When floating at or just below the surface, the mucilage can be up to 30 meters thick, but as it sinks, it compresses into a denser, thinner layer less than 10 meters thick. Ek\u015fiyan\u2019s dives are now spent documenting the mucilage with a homemade GoPro fashioned from a security camera and a plastic case. He showed me a compressor he uses to fill the oxygen mask that he made from Cold War\u2013era U.S. Air Force plane components that had been sold to the Turkish military. Diving in the mucilage, Ek\u015fiyan said, is like drifting through a nightmare; the mucilage hangs in massive webs, and even at noon the visibility is so low that it can feel like diving at night. As the mucilage continues compressing and sinking, it blankets the seabed. There, it blocks the entrances to caves and caverns, evicting fish from their homes. As the mucilage continues to decompose, it consumes oxygen, creating a dead zone\u2014an area without enough oxygen to sustain life. The coral Ek\u015fiyan had transplanted bleached due to the mucilage and abandoned nets, but it managed to survive\u2014for this year. \u201cAnd the reefs,\u201d he said, \u201care like abandoned villages.\u201d Asutay Akbay\u0131r, the regional manager of the Professional Association of Diving Instructors diver-training organization, comes from a family of divers; like Ek\u015fiyan, he has been diving in the Marmara for decades. Even before the mucilage outbreak, he told me, diving instructors and guides were losing their jobs because of the pollution in the Marmara. \u201cMost of the divers, they don\u2019t prefer to dive in challenging environments where the visibility is very low,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not even able to see your own hand when you dive, your own body.\u201d But Akbay\u0131r hopes that recreational diving will evolve, not disappear. Maybe, he said, divers will become ambassadors for the sea, telling the public about the devastation taking place underwater. What I\u2019d been looking at all summer, I realized, was not only an unfamiliar phenomenon but also an unfamiliar kind of death. To confront global warming is to confront death, and it will show up in surprising places and forms\u2014some painful, some disgusting, some disorienting. We talk about preparing for climate change , but how can we prepare for endings we can\u2019t yet imagine? By summer\u2019s end, life above the surface felt normal. The sea was clear and the beach clubs were packed. People ordered fish at restaurants with abandon. It was as if the sea-snot outbreak had never happened. In May, it had been an international story; by July, only the Turkish media were paying close attention; and by September, it had ceased to be a regular topic of conversation. In many bodies of water around the world, it was a summer of extremes. Red tides appeared in Florida; algal and bacterial blooms in dozens of reservoirs, lakes, and ponds in Massachusetts; and toxic blue-green algae in Lake Superior. As of October, 476 toxic-algae outbreaks had been reported in the United States, the second-highest number on record. Glacier scientists are investigating the appearance of pink ice at Italy\u2019s Presena Glacier, an Alpine region known for skiing and outdoor sports. Research suggests that the algae could contribute to increased glacial melt. A recent study published by a team at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, in Stockholm, and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln argued that these extreme blooms, and the dead zones left in their wake, parallel the beginnings of the worst extinction event in Earth\u2019s history\u2014the Permian-Triassic extinction, which happened some 252 million years ago and is sometimes called the \u201cGreat Dying.\u201d In September, just as the Turkish summer was shifting into fall, I got a phone call from Mustafa Yucel, the marine-science professor, who was inviting me to meet him and his team when their research vessel docked at Istanbul\u2019s Port of Haydarpa\u015fa. They had spent a week at sea checking their observation stations, and they reported that most of the mucilage was gone\u2014likely consumed by bacteria and fish. \u201cBut the conditions that led to this mucilage bloom are still present,\u201d Yucel cautioned. The more pressure put on a marine system, the more prone it is to an extreme reaction: a mass die-off of sea life or an outbreak of chunky, stinking mucilage. Or both. \u201cThe Marmara is now an extreme ecosystem\u2014extreme in algae, bacteria, and lack of oxygen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for us to predict what\u2019s next,\u201d Yucel said. \u201cThe sea snot may come back, because the conditions are there, but it could just as easily be some other extreme\u2014hydrogen sulfide, a red tide, massive fish kills rotting on a beach \u2026 Disgusting events will increase in frequency and magnitude.\u201d And as they do, they will also become more and more unmanageable. \u201cWhether we directly attribute it to climate change or to pollution, mucilage is a symptom of the unsustainable use of our planet,\u201d says Antonio Pusceddu, a marine biologist at Italy\u2019s University of Cagliari and one of the world\u2019s handful of mucilage experts. \u201cThe rate at which our planet changes now is unprecedented.\u201d Though Turkey\u2019s mucilage outbreak is the worst on record, smaller outbreaks have occurred along the coast of Australia and in the Mediterranean. When one particularly large and disruptive outbreak hit Italy\u2019s Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coastlines in 2009, Pusceddu and his colleagues investigated the relationship between climate change and the frequency of mucilage outbreaks in the Mediterranean Sea over the past two centuries. They found that the number of outbreaks had increased almost exponentially in the previous 20 years. But over the past decade, he told me, better wastewater treatment has reduced or eliminated the occurrence and severity of mucilage in Italy. In response to the sea-snot saga, the Turkish government designated the Marmara Sea as a special environmental-protection zone. That status requires a tighter review process for commercial maritime activity, more factory inspections and fines, and an increase in the percentage of water flowing into the Marmara that receives advanced biological treatment from 46 to 100 percent within three years. But how these measures will be funded or enforced remains unclear. After talking with Yucel and his colleagues in the Port of Haydarpa\u015fa, I stepped off their research vessel and looked back at the Marmara. I wanted to feel the same relief as the rest of Istanbul, to jump back into the sea and float in its tides, staring up at the blue sky. I wanted to believe that the water was clean, that the source of the disgusting ooze was gone. But instead, as I looked at the water, I felt something rise up inside me, a new feeling of disgust. Only this time, it wasn\u2019t a reaction to the mucilage. As long as humans continue polluting and heating the sea, marine ecosystems will become more delicate and less predictable. Each outbreak shows us the consequences of our own actions\u2014if we choose to see them. This Atlantic Planet story was supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.

{"id":null,"body":"People are planting more trees, thinking carefully about coastal development, and anticipating the future of California's wineries. In March of this year, a Gallup poll highlighted an interesting tension in American thinking on global warming: While a majority of respondents said they believe global warming has already begun, a majority also said they don\u2019t expect to suffer any hardships from global warming within their lifetimes. What the survey didn\u2019t ask was how many people across the country are already reacting to rising temperatures\u2014and preparing for those ahead. This past summer, twenty-somethings Allie Goldstein and Kirsten Howard took a road trip to document stories of what they call \u201cclimate resilience\u201d \u2013 examples of individuals and communities finding creative ways to adapt to hotter summers, stronger storms, bigger wildfires, rising sea levels, and more. They visited 31 states and offset their minivan\u2019s carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from Terrapass . Whether learning about Ann Arbor, Michigan\u2019s newly structured stormwater utility or evaluating the use of public art to mark evacuation routes in New Orleans, Goldstein and Howard found these examples everywhere they looked \u2014 suggesting that perhaps the rest of us don\u2019t have to travel far at all to witness similar initiatives being implemented. In some places, climate change is an explicit factor driving a city\u2019s action; such is the case in Baltimore, Maryland, which has a Climate Action Plan and a recently appointed \u201cHazard Mitigation and Adaptation Planner\u201d who is trying to build more tree canopy in the city\u2019s neighborhoods so that residents may benefit from increased shade during heat waves. In addition to combating the \u201c urban heat island effect \u201d (increased canopy can cool the city by up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit ), planting more trees has a host of other benefits: increasing property values and decreasing crime, according to Goldstein. These \u201cco-benefits\u201d were observed all around the country, Goldstein says, pointing out that sometimes \u201cresponding to climate change\u201d is a co-benefit in itself, tertiary to the main goal of attracting tourists or reducing crime. \u201cWhen we started this trip,\u201d says Goldstein, \u201csomeone told us we wouldn\u2019t find anyone to talk to about climate change in the south.\u201d That prediction proved false. \u00a0\u201cThere are definitely people who are still skeptical of the science or don\u2019t really believe that the impacts of climate change will come to their community in particular, but in general we found that this kind of politicized, black and white, \u2018believe or don\u2019t believe\u2019 thing that\u2019s presented in the news a lot is really a lot more nuanced than that.\u201d On the coast of North Carolina, they met Tom Thompson, the Chairman of the Board of NC-20, a conservative organization that Stephen Colbert poked fun at in 2012. Thompson may be \u201cskeptical\u201d of projections of a 39-inch sea-level rise in his area, but his objection to the plans to prepare for it \u2014 elevating homes, raising flood insurance rates \u2013 has more to do with his concerns about impoverishing the community, Goldstein and Howard write on their blog. \u00a0\u201cMy view of the world,\u201d he tells them, \"is as someone who has seen a lot of poverty \u2026 I just love this area and I want to protect it.\u201d Goldstein and Howard have also talked to Colorado fruit growers who are adapting to fluctuations in temperature without necessarily agreeing on the cause of the changes. \u201cThe farmers we spoke with, for the most part,\u201d they write, \u201caren\u2019t attributing the longer growing season to climate change.\u201d The farmers view fluctuating weather patterns as normal. But in response to the latest variations, they are diversifying their harvests in anticipation of losing some crops each season, and using wind machines to nudge the air temperatures in the fields by half degrees to prevent freezing. Howard tells me she was \u201camazed by the number of places where at the municipal level they had some sort of effort to actually identify their climate variability and predict what the local impact to their communities would be.\u201d The great takeaway from this project, she says, seems to be that \u201cpeople are really in touch with \u2018their place.\u2019\u201d Even if they aren\u2019t concerned about climate change on a global scale or they think it doesn\u2019t affect them, \u201conce you get down to talking about their neighborhoods, their cities, they know so much\u2026 and are, in a lot of cases, working really hard to make it the best place to live.\u201d Changing attitudes toward climate change on a larger scale were evident at the 7 national parks Goldstein and Howard visited. At Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park, for example, more and more tourists are attracted precisely because of scientific estimates that the park\u2019s glaciers will be gone by 2030. In addition, learning about glacial retreat is now an integral part of the visitor experience at GNP. On their blog , Goldstein and Howard quote\u00a0a National Park Service staff member who gives weekly presentations titled \u201cWhere Have All the Glaciers Gone?\u201d and said: \u201cAt first, [the Park Service\u2019s] attitude was, \u2018people are on vacation, don\u2019t upset them by talking about global warming.\u2019 Now, we have a mandate to talk about it.\u201d Besides communicating more explicitly about the effects of global warming, Park Service staff are also initiating ecological interventions \u2013 \u201cperhaps a little more heavy-handedly than they have in the past,\u201d Goldstein and Howard write. In 2003, the Park Service deliberately directed a forest fire away from the region\u2019s huckleberries, which bears eat; to prevent invasive species from reaching the park\u2019s Quartz Lake, they constructed a barrier in Quartz Creek. It\u2019s\u00a0 a similar story \u00a0at Joshua Tree National Park in California, where, like Montana\u2019s glaciers, Joshua Trees are disappearing. Park Service specialists are trying to better understand the factors determining survival and death of the trees, and they\u2019re also weighing some drastic interventions to preserve the tree population, such as manually relocating trees to areas with \u201cfuture favorable climates.\u201d It would be a shame for these parks to lose their namesakes, but Goldstein and Howard\u2019s observations across America suggest that cities and towns may be better poised to adapt to climate change than wilderness areas are. The stories from the cities seem hopeful; the dispatches from Glacier and Joshua Tree, less so. Perhaps that is because existential threats \u2013 changes that would alter the defining characteristics of a place \u2013 are more difficult to contemplate before they occur. Who would have thought, ten or twenty or fifty years ago, that a glacier-less Glacier National Park was possible? In Napa Valley, though, exactly that kind of forethought is taking place. The region is well-known as wine country. Local vintners, write Goldstein and Howard , formed a climate task force in 2006 to meticulously track temperature changes and develop strategies to manipulate microclimates in the vineyards. They installed weather stations in the vineyards, sifted through farmers\u2019 harvest logs from past decades, and are even testing solar-powered sensors on their vines to monitor plant hydration day by day. What they have found is, so far, a much slower progression in temperatures in Napa Valley than has been measured elsewhere, allowing growers to put scientists\u2019 projections into context, and gauge when it might be time to start switching cultivars. They\u2019re doing their homework, in other words, and providing a standout example of what it takes to stay ahead of existential threats \u2014 climate change may mean the end of glaciers, but it won\u2019t, hopefully, mean the end of California wine.","headline":"The Many Small Ways Americans Are Adapting to Climate Change","article_name":279800.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/09\/the-many-small-ways-americans-are-adapting-to-climate-change\/279800\/","date_published":"2013-09-19 11:00:00","article_length":7685,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:02.659503","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/national\/archive\/2013\/09\/the-many-small-ways-americans-are-adapting-to-climate-change\/279800\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A new book from Barry Lopez underscores how the genre has evolved as planetary conditions have worsened. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make the mistake when traveling abroad of finding only the good or only the bad in a place, easy to miss how complicated the weave of bad with good is,\u201d Barry Lopez writes in his new book, Horizon . Lopez is forgiving himself here as he recalls a trip to Gal\u00e1pagos National Park and the island settlement Puerto Villamil. Its residents were then at odds, sometimes violently, with authorities over the right to hunt and fish within the \u201cdreamscape\u201d park in the Pacific where, he writes, the needs of ecotourists, creationists, poachers, and schemers have long collided. But Lopez is also forgiving all travelers who commit the sin of looking away from what shouldn\u2019t be ignored. At least for the moment he is, anyway. Part autobiography, part cri de coeur, Horizon finds the longtime travel and science writer recounting trips he\u2019s taken to six regions of the world: the Canadian High Arctic, the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, Eastern Equatorial Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and the coast of Oregon, his home state. Now in his 70s, Lopez writes with fervid wonder and fascination about all he\u2019s seen and experienced. This includes coming \u201cface to face\u201d with a 600-pound Weddell seal while diving beneath sea ice in Antarctica, searching for hominin fossils with the paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey in Kenya, and, in one particularly lovely scene, waking late one night on Oregon\u2019s Cape Foulweather to find five Roosevelt elk grazing just beyond his tent. Most of all, though, Lopez is gripped by an urgency to tell \u201ca coherent and meaningful story\u201d about the threat of humanity\u2019s extinction as a result of climate change and societal declension, and the ways he believes it can be prevented. \u201cI want everyone here to survive what is coming,\u201d he writes. By bringing his past observations and experiences into the present, Lopez underscores how travel writing has changed as planetary conditions have worsened. In 1986, when he published Arctic Dreams \u2014a National Book Award winner about his explorations in the Far North\u2014he noted that humanity\u2019s role in extinctions across the animal kingdom \u201cseems inescapable.\u201d But he argued against the viewpoint that \u201cwe are \u2026 headed for extinction in a universe of impersonal chemical, physical, and biological laws.\u201d Instead, he noted that we can prevent that outcome by finding \u201cthe courage to take steps that may bear no fruit in our lifetimes.\u201d The tone of this sentiment rings several octaves lower than the more immediate mandate Lopez issues for the human species in his new book: \u201cCooperate with one another or die.\u201d Read: A trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Island s This change in attitude and reality can also be found in Cheryl Strayed\u2019s introduction to the 2018 edition of The Best American Travel Writing , in which the Wild author writes that the mission of travel writing to \u201creveal truths about what it means to be human through the lens of our relationship to place, culture, and era\u201d is intensifying as \u201cwe come to grips with the grave ecological consequences of human-caused climate change and the devastating results of religious and ideological extremism, cultural imperialism, and xenophobia.\u201d It\u2019s also evident in The New York Times \u2019 \u201c52 Places Traveler\u201d series, for which the columnist Sebastian Modak is currently visiting sites such as the imperiled ice caves along the Ontario side of Lake Superior. \u201cTo see them now, before they\u2019re gone, felt like an immense privilege,\u201d Modak writes , \u201ceven as I was forced to confront the contradictions that arise from the amount of carbon I expended getting to them.\u201d Horizon amplifies these warnings to an almost deafening level and makes any travel writing that doesn\u2019t share Lopez\u2019s sense of responsibility and purpose seem derelict by comparison. Concerns about self-serving governments, injustice, and exceptionalism appear throughout the book. Lopez\u2019s reflections on Australia begin with his visit to the Port Arthur Historic Site, a former prison on the Tasman Sea to which the British Crown in the 1800s dispatched people it considered undesirable, including boys as young as 8 years old. Later, in Western Australia, he surveys the geographic damage done by commercial mining and the \u201cinjustices and lack of charity\u201d the land\u2019s Aboriginal residents have suffered at the hands of industry. He visits the site of a future nitrate plant where workers have bulldozed 25,000-year-old Aboriginal rock art and \u201cdumped it like so much construction debris.\u201d While reflecting on the lessons he has learned from indigenous people in places such as the Pilbara district in Australia and Skraeling Island in the Canadian Arctic, Lopez recalls coming to the realization that \u201cas much as I believed I was fully present in the physical worlds through which I was traveling over the years, I understood over time that I was not. More often I was only thinking about the place I was in.\u201d For Lopez, the luxury of detachment\u2014of simple tourism even\u2014is not an option. Lopez is by no means encouraging travelers to forgo vacations or to blind themselves to the limitless displays of beauty the natural world has to offer in favor of anxiety and desperation. It\u2019s thrilling to read about Lopez watching through the window of a locomotive \u201cmore than a hundred kangaroos bounding north and west across the plain, then veering away to the west as they approached the train tracks and the hurtling train.\u201d An account of a Gal\u00e1pagos scuba trip in search of \u201cmoving \u2018walls\u2019 of hammerhead sharks\u201d yields the hoped-for excitement. And Lopez\u2019s descriptions of hiking through the middle of a polar desert in the Arctic are invigorating. It requires a certain degree of ego and fortune to be able to share stories about flying a kite at the South Pole, diving the Great Barrier Reef, and dodging venomous mambas in Kenya. Lopez recognizes this, but he also heeds the demand for humility inherent in such adventures. \u201cYou feel while you are witnessing such things that you must carry some of this home,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat what you\u2019ve found are not your things but our things.\u201d","headline":"How Climate Change Has Influenced Travel Writing","article_name":585031.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2019\/03\/barry-lopez-warns-about-climate-change-new-book\/585031\/","date_published":"2019-03-15 16:19:00","article_length":6163,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:03.732526","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2019\/03\/barry-lopez-warns-about-climate-change-new-book\/585031\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Climate change explains only 20 percent of the movement. As the consequences of climate change strike across the United States, ecologists have a guiding principle about how they think plants will respond. Cold-adapted plants will survive if they move \u201cup\u201d\u2014that is, as they move further north (away from the tropics) and higher in elevation (away from the warm ground). A new survey of how tree populations have shifted over the past three decades finds that this effect is already in action. But there\u2019s a twist: Even more than moving poleward, trees are moving west . About three-quarters of tree species common to eastern American forests\u2014including white oaks, sugar maples, and American hollies\u2014have shifted their population center west since 1980. More than half of the species studied also moved northward during the same period. These results, among the first to use empirical data to look at how climate change is shaping eastern forests, were published in Science Advances on Wednesday. Trees, of course, don\u2019t move themselves. But their populations can shift over time, and saplings can expand into a new region while older growth dies in another. The research team compared a tree population to a line of people stretching from Atlanta to Indianapolis: Even if everyone in the line stood still, if you added new people to the end of the line in Indiana and asked others in Georgia to leave, then the center of the line would move nonetheless. The results are fascinating in part because they don\u2019t immediately make sense. But the team has a hypothesis: While climate change has elevated temperatures across the eastern United States, it has significantly altered rainfall totals. The northeast has gotten a little more rain since 1980 than it did during the proceeding century, while the southeast has gotten much less rain. The Great Plains, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas, get much more than historically normal. \u201cDifferent species are responding to climate change differently. Most of the broad-leaf species\u2014deciduous trees\u2014are following moisture moving westward. The evergreen trees\u2014the needle species\u2014are primarily moving northward,\u201d said Songlin Fei, a professor of forestry at Purdue University and one of the authors of the study. There are a patchwork of other forces which could cause tree populations to shift west, though. Changes in land use, wildfire frequency, and the arrival of pests and blights could be shifting the population. So might the success of conservation efforts. But Fei and his colleagues argue that at least 20 percent of the change in population area is driven by changes in precipitation, which are heavily influenced by human-caused climate change. \u201cThis is a very cool study, with results that seem to raise more questions than they can provide answers for,\u201d said Lo\u00efc D\u2019Orangeville, an ecologist at the Quebec Forest Research Center who was not connected to the study, in an email. \u201cWest is usually drier in the study region, so although it\u2019s been wetter in the recent decades, it\u2019s still drier than the East.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t really make up [for] that moisture attractiveness for trees,\u201d he added. The movement of conifers and other needle trees north makes much more sense. Conifers are already more vulnerable to temperature than flowering, deciduous trees. They also already populate the boreal forest of eastern North America, so they\u2019re well-adapted to the colder, drier conditions they will find as they expand north in the United States. Fei and his colleagues don\u2019t know if the westward trend will continue. We may have already seen the peak of westward movement, and northward expansion may soon outrank it. \u201cWhen the result came out that trees are moving westward, our eyeballs opened wide. Like, \u2018Wow, what\u2019s going on with this?\u2019 The results seem to show that moisture plays a much more significant role in the near-term, which is very intriguing,\u201d he told me. The survey draws on the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s Forest Inventory and Analysis Program , a kind of continuously running census of the country\u2019s tree population. The program, which stepped up in 1978 but which has been conducted in some form since the 1930s , surveys the health, density, and species mix of forested areas across the country. It examines not only the majestic, landmark tracts of untrammeled forest (like George Washington National Forest) but the humbler woods, as well: stands of trees near the highway, at the edge of housing developments, and in the middle of city parks. \u201cThis is not a modeling exercise, there are no predictions, this is empirical data,\u201d said Fei. \u201cThis study is looking at everything everywhere in the eastern United States.\u201d What concerns the team is that\u2014if deciduous trees are moving westward while conifers move northward\u2014important ecological communities of forests could start to break up in the east. Forests are defined as much by the mix of species, and the interaction between them, as by the simple presence of a lot of trees. If different species migrate in different directions, then communities could start to collapse. \u201cIf you have a group of friends, and people move away to different places\u2014some go to college in different places, and some move to Florida\u2014the group is \u2026 probably going to fall apart,\u201d Fei said. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in whether this tree community is falling apart.\u201d \u201cThese results show contemporary proof of something we know has happened before and will happen again: that trees are highly dynamic organisms, constantly moving in response to climatic shifts like recent glaciations or other disturbances. Their actual range does not reflect conditions that are optimal for their growth,\u201d said D\u2019Orangeville. Any tree\u2019s range represents \u201ca legacy of historical migrations and battles lost against other species or disturbances. With climate change however, their capacity to keep pace with the fast-changing climate is a major issue.\u201d","headline":"American Trees Are Moving West, and No One Knows Why","article_name":526899.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/go-west-my-sap\/526899\/","date_published":"2017-05-17 18:00:36","article_length":5918,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:05.041137","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/05\/go-west-my-sap\/526899\/","source":"atlantic"}

This new reporting focus is part of Planet , The Atlantic\u2019 s guide to life on a warming planet. Several features have so far been published, with additional reports to appear throughout 2022. In the latest article, \u201c Idaho Is Sitting on One of the Most Important Elements on Earth ,\u201d Michael Holtz reports that the clean-energy revolution is unleashing a rush on cobalt, reviving old mines\u2014and old questions\u2014in a remote forest. Holtz writes: \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to see Blackbird and Cobalt as cautionary tales\u2014to conclude that mines will always create environmental disasters and that mining booms are always followed by devastating busts. And yet during the two weeks I spent in and around Salmon, many people I met expressed cautious optimism about the return of cobalt mining.\u201d Other stories in the series have so far reported from California\u2019s coast, Turkey\u2019s Sea of Marmara, and America\u2019s heartland to examine the way climate change is affecting our lives\u2014now, not in the distant future. \u201c Floating Wind Farms Are About to Transform the Oceans ,\u201d by Judith Lewis Mernit, reports on the effects of floating wind generation on the ocean ecosystem. Mernit examines the development of the technology and how \u201crenewable-energy development too often comes at the expense of the very habitats we\u2019re trying to preserve.\u201d \u201c Real Men Drive Electric Trucks ,\u201d by Ruxandra Guidi, addresses the need for U.S. drivers to embrace electric vehicles. With the introduction of electric pickup trucks, renewable-energy enthusiasts hope an American staple becomes more eco-friendly. The article also covers the challenge of making climate consciousness part of a culture that is still intensely and stereotypically macho. \u201c Climate Change Is Going to Be Gross ,\u201d by Jenna Scatena, focuses on the thick layer of mucilage\u2013\u2013or sea snot\u2013\u2013that recently covered the Sea of Marmara for weeks, the result of an ailing ecosystem. The mucilage was temporarily disastrous for Turkey\u2019s local fishing and tourism industries. Scatena writes: \u201cAs long as humans continue polluting and heating the sea, marine ecosystems will become more delicate and less predictable. Each outbreak shows us the consequences of our own actions\u2014if we choose to see them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 This series of global reports is supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education, the leading private nonprofit supporter of science education in the United States.

{"id":null,"body":"\u201cClimate change\u201d is popularly understood to mean greenhouse warming, which, it is predicted, will cause flooding, severe windstorms, and killer heat waves. But warming could lead, paradoxically, to drastic cooling\u2014a catastrophe that could threaten the survival of civilization. One of the most shocking scientific realizations of all time has slowly been dawning on us: the earth\u2019s climate does great flip-flops every few thousand years, and with breathtaking speed. We could go back to ice-age temperatures within a decade\u2014and judging from recent discoveries, an abrupt cooling could be triggered by our current global-warming trend. Europe\u2019s climate could become more like Siberia\u2019s. Because such a cooling would occur too quickly for us to make readjustments in agricultural productivity and supply, it would be a potentially civilization-shattering affair, likely to cause an unprecedented population crash. What paleoclimate and oceanography researchers know of the mechanisms underlying such a climate flip suggests that global warming could start one in several different ways. For a quarter century global-warming theorists have predicted that climate creep is going to occur and that we need to prevent greenhouse gases from warming things up, thereby raising the sea level, destroying habitats, intensifying storms, and forcing agricultural rearrangements. Now we know\u2014and from an entirely different group of scientists exploring separate lines of reasoning and data\u2014that the most catastrophic result of global warming could be an abrupt cooling. We are in a warm period now. Scientists have known for some time that the previous warm period started 130,000 years ago and ended 117,000 years ago, with the return of cold temperatures that led to an ice age. But the ice ages aren\u2019t what they used to be. They were formerly thought to be very gradual, with both air temperature and ice sheets changing in a slow, 100,000-year cycle tied to changes in the earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. But our current warm-up, which started about 15,000 years ago, began abruptly, with the temperature rising sharply while most of the ice was still present. We now know that there\u2019s nothing \u201cglacially slow\u201d about temperature change: superimposed on the gradual, long-term cycle have been dozens of abrupt warmings and coolings that lasted only centuries. The back and forth of the ice started 2.5 million years ago, which is also when the ape-sized hominid brain began to develop into a fully human one, four times as large and reorganized for language, music, and chains of inference. Ours is now a brain able to anticipate outcomes well enough to practice ethical behavior, able to head off disasters in the making by extrapolating trends. Our civilizations began to emerge right after the continental ice sheets melted about 10,000 years ago. Civilizations accumulate knowledge, so we now know a lot about what has been going on, what has made us what we are. We puzzle over oddities, such as the climate of Europe. Europe is an anomaly. The populous parts of the United States and Canada are mostly between the latitudes of 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, whereas the populous parts of Europe are ten to fifteen degrees farther north. \u201cSoutherly\u201d Rome lies near the same latitude, 42\u00b0N, as \u201cnortherly\u201d Chicago\u2014and the most northerly major city in Asia is Beijing, near 40\u00b0. N. London and Paris are close to the 49\u00b0N line that, west of the Great Lakes, separates the United States from Canada. Berlin is up at about 52\u00b0, Copenhagen and Moscow at about 56\u00b0. Oslo is nearly at 60\u00b0N, as are Stockholm, Helsinki, and St. Petersburg; continue due east and you\u2019ll encounter Anchorage. Europe\u2019s climate, obviously, is not like that of North America or Asia at the same latitudes. For Europe to be as agriculturally productive as it is (it supports more than twice the population of the United States and Canada), all those cold, dry winds that blow eastward across the North Atlantic from Canada must somehow be warmed up. The job is done by warm water flowing north from the tropics, as the eastbound Gulf Stream merges into the North Atlantic Current. This warm water then flows up the Norwegian coast, with a westward branch warming Greenland\u2019s tip, at 60\u00b0N. It keeps northern Europe about nine to eighteen degrees warmer in the winter than comparable latitudes elsewhere\u2014except when it fails. Then not only Europe but also, to everyone\u2019s surprise, the rest of the world gets chilled. Tropical swamps decrease their production of methane at the same time that Europe cools, and the Gobi Desert whips much more dust into the air. When this happens, something big, with worldwide connections, must be switching into a new mode of operation. The North Atlantic Current is certainly something big, with the flow of about a hundred Amazon Rivers. And it sometimes changes its route dramatically, much as a bus route can be truncated into a shorter loop. Its effects are clearly global too, inasmuch as it is part of a long \u201csalt conveyor\u201d current that extends through the southern oceans into the Pacific. I hope never to see a failure of the northernmost loop of the North Atlantic Current, because the result would be a population crash that would take much of civilization with it, all within a decade. Ways to postpone such a climatic shift are conceivable, however\u2014old-fashioned dam-and-ditch construction in critical locations might even work. Although we can\u2019t do much about everyday weather, we may nonetheless be able to stabilize the climate enough to prevent an abrupt cooling. The discovery of abrupt climate changes has been spread out over the past fifteen years, and is well known to readers of major scientific journals such as Scienceand Nature.The abruptness data are convincing. Within the ice sheets of Greenland are annual layers that provide a record of the gases present in the atmosphere and indicate the changes in air temperature over the past 250,000 years\u2014the period of the last two major ice ages. By 250,000 years ago Homo erectushad died out, after a run of almost two million years. By 125,000 years ago Homo sapienshad evolved from our ancestor species\u2014so the whiplash climate changes of the last ice age affected people much like us. In Greenland a given year\u2019s snowfall is compacted into ice during the ensuing years, trapping air bubbles, and so paleoclimate researchers have been able to glimpse ancient climates in some detail. Water falling as snow on Greenland carries an isotopic \u201cfingerprint\u201d of what the temperature was like en route. Counting those tree-ring-like layers in the ice cores shows that cooling came on as quickly as droughts. Indeed, were another climate flip to begin next year, we\u2019d probably complain first about the drought, along with unusually cold winters in Europe. In the first few years the climate could cool as much as it did during the misnamed Little Ice Age (a gradual cooling that lasted from the early Renaissance until the end of the nineteenth century), with tenfold greater changes over the next decade or two. The most recent big cooling started about 12,700 years ago, right in the midst of our last global warming. This cold period, known as the Younger Dryas, is named for the pollen of a tundra flower that turned up in a lake bed in Denmark when it shouldn\u2019t have. Things had been warming up, and half the ice sheets covering Europe and Canada had already melted. The return to ice-age temperatures lasted 1,300 years. Then, about 11,400 years ago, things suddenly warmed up again, and the earliest agricultural villages were established in the Middle East. An abrupt cooling got started 8,200 years ago, but it aborted within a century, and the temperature changes since then have been gradual in comparison. Indeed, we\u2019ve had an unprecedented period of climate stability. Coring old lake beds and examining the types of pollen trapped in sediment layers led to the discovery, early in the twentieth century, of the Younger Dryas. Pollen cores are still a primary means of seeing what regional climates were doing, even though they suffer from poorer resolution than ice cores (worms churn the sediment, obscuring records of all but the longest-lasting temperature changes). When the ice cores demonstrated the abrupt onset of the Younger Dryas, researchers wanted to know how widespread this event was. The U.S. Geological Survey took old lake-bed cores out of storage and re-examined them. Ancient lakes near the Pacific coast of the United States, it turned out, show a shift to cold-weather plant species at roughly the time when the Younger Dryas was changing German pine forests into scrublands like those of modern Siberia. Subarctic ocean currents were reaching the southern California coastline, and Santa Barbara must have been as cold as Juneau is now. (But the regional record is poorly understood, and I know at least one reason why. These days when one goes to hear a talk on ancient climates of North America, one is likely to learn that the speaker was forced into early retirement from the U.S. Geological Survey by budget cuts. Rather than a vigorous program of studying regional climatic change, we see the shortsighted preaching of cheaper government at any cost.) In 1984, when I first heard about the startling news from the ice cores, the implications were unclear\u2014there seemed to be other ways of interpreting the data from Greenland. It was initially hoped that the abrupt warmings and coolings were just an oddity of Greenland\u2019s weather\u2014but they have now been detected on a worldwide scale, and at about the same time. Then it was hoped that the abrupt flips were somehow caused by continental ice sheets, and thus would be unlikely to recur, because we now lack huge ice sheets over Canada and Northern Europe. Though some abrupt coolings are likely to have been associated with events in the Canadian ice sheet, the abrupt cooling in the previous warm period, 122,000 years ago, which has now been detected even in the tropics, shows that flips are not restricted to icy periods; they can also interrupt warm periods like the present one. There seems to be no way of escaping the conclusion that global climate flips occur frequently and abruptly. An abrupt cooling could happen now, and the world might not warm up again for a long time: it looks as if the last warm period, having lasted 13,000 years, came to an end with an abrupt, prolonged cooling. That\u2019s how our warm period might end too. Sudden onset, sudden recovery\u2014this is why I use the word \u201cflip-flop\u201d to describe these climate changes. They are utterly unlike the changes that one would expect from accumulating carbon dioxide or the setting adrift of ice shelves from Antarctica. Change arising from some sources, such as volcanic eruptions, can be abrupt\u2014but the climate doesn\u2019t flip back just as quickly centuries later. Temperature records suggest that there is some grand mechanism underlying all of this, and that it has two major states. Again, the difference between them amounts to nine to eighteen degrees\u2014a range that may depend on how much ice there is to slow the responses. I call the colder one the \u201clow state.\u201d In discussing the ice ages there is a tendency to think of warm as good\u2014and therefore of warming as better. Alas, further warming might well kick us out of the \u201chigh state.\u201d It\u2019s the high state that\u2019s good, and we may need to help prevent any sudden transition to the cold low state. Although the sun\u2019s energy output does flicker slightly, the likeliest reason for these abrupt flips is an intermittent problem in the North Atlantic Ocean, one that seems to trigger a major rearrangement of atmospheric circulation. North-south ocean currents help to redistribute equatorial heat into the temperate zones, supplementing the heat transfer by winds. When the warm currents penetrate farther than usual into the northern seas, they help to melt the sea ice that is reflecting a lot of sunlight back into space, and so the earth becomes warmer. Eventually that helps to melt ice sheets elsewhere. The high state of climate seems to involve ocean currents that deliver an extraordinary amount of heat to the vicinity of Iceland and Norway. Like bus routes or conveyor belts, ocean currents must have a return loop. Unlike most ocean currents, the North Atlantic Current has a return loop that runs deep beneath the ocean surface. Huge amounts of seawater sink at known downwelling sites every winter, with the water heading south when it reaches the bottom. When that annual flushing fails for some years, the conveyor belt stops moving and so heat stops flowing so far north\u2014and apparently we\u2019re popped back into the low state. Surface waters are flushed regularly, even in lakes. Twice a year they sink, carrying their load of atmospheric gases downward. That\u2019s because water density changes with temperature. Water is densest at about 39\u00b0F (a typical refrigerator setting\u2014anything that you take out of the refrigerator, whether you place it on the kitchen counter or move it to the freezer, is going to expand a little). A lake surface cooling down in the autumn will eventually sink into the less-dense-because-warmer waters below, mixing things up. Seawater is more complicated, because salt content also helps to determine whether water floats or sinks. Water that evaporates leaves its salt behind; the resulting saltier water is heavier and thus sinks. The fact that excess salt is flushed from surface waters has global implications, some of them recognized two centuries ago. Salt circulates, because evaporation up north causes it to sink and be carried south by deep currents. This was posited in 1797 by the Anglo-American physicist Sir Benjamin Thompson (later known, after he moved to Bavaria, as Count Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire), who also posited that, if merely to compensate, there would have to be a warmer northbound current as well. By 1961 the oceanographer Henry Stommel, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in Massachusetts, was beginning to worry that these warming currents might stop flowing if too much fresh water was added to the surface of the northern seas. By 1987 the geochemist Wallace Broecker, of Columbia University, was piecing together the paleoclimatic flip-flops with the salt-circulation story and warning that small nudges to our climate might produce \u201cunpleasant surprises in the greenhouse.\u201d Oceans are not well mixed at any time. Like a half-beaten cake mix, with strands of egg still visible, the ocean has a lot of blobs and streams within it. When there has been a lot of evaporation, surface waters are saltier than usual. Sometimes they sink to considerable depths without mixing. The Mediterranean waters flowing out of the bottom of the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic Ocean are about 10 percent saltier than the ocean\u2019s average, and so they sink into the depths of the Atlantic. A nice little Amazon-sized waterfall flows over the ridge that connects Spain with Morocco, 800 feet below the surface of the strait. Another underwater ridge line stretches from Greenland to Iceland and on to the Faeroe Islands and Scotland. It, too, has a salty waterfall, which pours the hypersaline bottom waters of the Nordic Seas (the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea) south into the lower levels of the North Atlantic Ocean. This salty waterfall is more like thirty Amazon Rivers combined. Why does it exist? The cold, dry winds blowing eastward off Canada evaporate the surface waters of the North Atlantic Current, and leave behind all their salt. In late winter the heavy surface waters sink en masse. These blobs, pushed down by annual repetitions of these late-winter events, flow south, down near the bottom of the Atlantic. The same thing happens in the Labrador Sea between Canada and the southern tip of Greenland. Salt sinking on such a grand scale in the Nordic Seas causes warm water to flow much farther north than it might otherwise do. This produces a heat bonus of perhaps 30 percent beyond the heat provided by direct sunlight to these seas, accounting for the mild winters downwind, in northern Europe. It has been called the Nordic Seas heat pump. Nothing like this happens in the Pacific Ocean, but the Pacific is nonetheless affected, because the sink in the Nordic Seas is part of a vast worldwide salt-conveyor belt. Such a conveyor is needed because the Atlantic is saltier than the Pacific (the Pacific has twice as much water with which to dilute the salt carried in from rivers). The Atlantic would be even saltier if it didn\u2019t mix with the Pacific, in long, loopy currents. These carry the North Atlantic\u2019s excess salt southward from the bottom of the Atlantic, around the tip of Africa, through the Indian Ocean, and up around the Pacific Ocean. There used to be a tropical shortcut, an express route from Atlantic to Pacific, but continental drift connected North America to South America about three million years ago, damming up the easy route for disposing of excess salt. The dam, known as the Isthmus of Panama, may have been what caused the ice ages to begin a short time later, simply because of the forced detour. This major change in ocean circulation, along with a climate that had already been slowly cooling for millions of years, led not only to ice accumulation most of the time but also to climatic instability, with flips every few thousand years or so. Flying above the clouds often presents an interesting picture when there are mountains below. Out of the sea of undulating white clouds mountain peaks stick up like islands. Greenland looks like that, even on a cloudless day\u2014but the great white mass between the occasional punctuations is an ice sheet. In places this frozen fresh water descends from the highlands in a wavy staircase. Twenty thousand years ago a similar ice sheet lay atop the Baltic Sea and the land surrounding it. Another sat on Hudson\u2019s Bay, and reached as far west as the foothills of the Rocky Mountains\u2014where it pushed, head to head, against ice coming down from the Rockies. These northern ice sheets were as high as Greenland\u2019s mountains, obstacles sufficient to force the jet stream to make a detour. Now only Greenland\u2019s ice remains, but the abrupt cooling in the last warm period shows that a flip can occur in situations much like the present one. What could possibly halt the salt-conveyor belt that brings tropical heat so much farther north and limits the formation of ice sheets? Oceanographers are busy studying present-day failures of annual flushing, which give some perspective on the catastrophic failures of the past. In the Labrador Sea, flushing failed during the 1970s, was strong again by 1990, and is now declining. In the Greenland Sea over the 1980s salt sinking declined by 80 percent. Obviously, local failures can occur without catastrophe\u2014it\u2019s a question of how often and how widespread the failures are\u2014but the present state of decline is not very reassuring. Large-scale flushing at both those sites is certainly a highly variable process, and perhaps a somewhat fragile one as well. And in the absence of a flushing mechanism to sink cooled surface waters and send them southward in the Atlantic, additional warm waters do not flow as far north to replenish the supply. There are a few obvious precursors to flushing failure. One is diminished wind chill, when winds aren\u2019t as strong as usual, or as cold, or as dry\u2014as is the case in the Labrador Sea during the North Atlantic Oscillation. This El Ni\u00f1o-like shift in the atmospheric-circulation pattern over the North Atlantic, from the Azores to Greenland, often lasts a decade. At the same time that the Labrador Sea gets a lessening of the strong winds that aid salt sinking, Europe gets particularly cold winters. It\u2019s happening right now:a North Atlantic Oscillation started in 1996. Another precursor is more floating ice than usual, which reduces the amount of ocean surface exposed to the winds, in turn reducing evaporation. Retained heat eventually melts the ice, in a cycle that recurs about every five years. Yet another precursor, as Henry Stommel suggested in 1961, would be the addition of fresh water to the ocean surface, diluting the salt-heavy surface waters before they became unstable enough to start sinking. More rain falling in the northern oceans\u2014exactly what is predicted as a result of global warming\u2014could stop salt flushing. So could ice carried south out of the Arctic Ocean. There is also a great deal of unsalted water in Greenland\u2019s glaciers, just uphill from the major salt sinks. The last time an abrupt cooling occurred was in the midst of global warming. Many ice sheets had already half melted, dumping a lot of fresh water into the ocean. A brief, large flood of fresh water might nudge us toward an abrupt cooling even if the dilution were insignificant when averaged over time. The fjords of Greenland offer some dramatic examples of the possibilities for freshwater floods. Fjords are long, narrow canyons, little arms of the sea reaching many miles inland; they were carved by great glaciers when the sea level was lower. Greenland\u2019s east coast has a profusion of fjords between 70\u00b0N and 80\u00b0N, including one that is the world\u2019s biggest. If blocked by ice dams, fjords make perfect reservoirs for meltwater. Glaciers pushing out into the ocean usually break off in chunks. Whole sections of a glacier, lifted up by the tides, may snap off at the \u201chinge\u201d and become icebergs. But sometimes a glacial surge will act like an avalanche that blocks a road, as happened when Alaska\u2019s Hubbard glacier surged into the Russell fjord in May of 1986. Its snout ran into the opposite side, blocking the fjord with an ice dam. Any meltwater coming in behind the dam stayed there. A lake formed, rising higher and higher\u2014up to the height of an eight-story building. Eventually such ice dams break, with spectacular results. Once the dam is breached, the rushing waters erode an ever wider and deeper path. Thus the entire lake can empty quickly. Five months after the ice dam at the Russell fjord formed, it broke, dumping a cubic mile of fresh water in only twenty-four hours. The Great Salinity Anomaly, a pool of semi-salty water derived from about 500 times as much unsalted water as that released by Russell Lake, was tracked from 1968 to 1982 as it moved south from Greenland\u2019s east coast. In 1970 it arrived in the Labrador Sea, where it prevented the usual salt sinking. By 1971-1972 the semi-salty blob was off Newfoundland. It then crossed the Atlantic and passed near the Shetland Islands around 1976. From there it was carried northward by the warm Norwegian Current, whereupon some of it swung west again to arrive off Greenland\u2019s east coast\u2014where it had started its inch-per-second journey. So freshwater blobs drift, sometimes causing major trouble, and Greenland floods thus have the potential to stop the enormous heat transfer that keeps the North Atlantic Current going strong. Of this much we\u2019re sure: global climate flip-flops have frequently happened in the past, and they\u2019re likely to happen again. It\u2019s also clear that sufficient global warming could trigger an abrupt cooling in at least two ways\u2014by increasing high-latitude rainfall or by melting Greenland\u2019s ice, both of which could put enough fresh water into the ocean surface to suppress flushing. Further investigation might lead to revisions in such mechanistic explanations, but the result of adding fresh water to the ocean surface is pretty standard physics. In almost four decades of subsequent research Henry Stommel\u2019s theory has only been enhanced, not seriously challenged. Up to this point in the story none of the broad conclusions is particularly speculative. But to address how all these nonlinear mechanisms fit together\u2014and what we might do to stabilize the climate\u2014will require some speculation. Even the tropics cool down by about nine degrees during an abrupt cooling, and it is hard to imagine what in the past could have disturbed the whole earth\u2019s climate on this scale. We must look at arriving sunlight and departing light and heat, not merely regional shifts on earth, to account for changes in the temperature balance. Increasing amounts of sea ice and clouds could reflect more sunlight back into space, but the geochemist Wallace Broecker suggests that a major greenhouse gas is disturbed by the failure of the salt conveyor, and that this affects the amount of heat retained. In Broecker\u2019s view, failures of salt flushing cause a worldwide rearrangement of ocean currents, resulting in\u2014and this is the speculative part\u2014less evaporation from the tropics. That, in turn, makes the air drier. Because water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas, this decrease in average humidity would cool things globally. Broecker has written, \u201cIf you wanted to cool the planet by 5\u00b0C [9\u00b0F] and could magically alter the water-vapor content of the atmosphere, a 30 percent decrease would do the job.\u201d Just as an El Ni\u00f1o produces a hotter Equator in the Pacific Ocean and generates more atmospheric convection, so there might be a subnormal mode that decreases heat, convection, and evaporation. For example, I can imagine that ocean currents carrying more warm surface waters north or south from the equatorial regions might, in consequence, cool the Equator somewhat. That might result in less evaporation, creating lower-than-normal levels of greenhouse gases and thus a global cooling. To see how ocean circulation might affect greenhouse gases, we must try to account quantitatively for important nonlinearities, ones in which little nudges provoke great responses. The modern world is full of objects and systems that exhibit \u201cbistable\u201d modes, with thresholds for flipping. Light switches abruptly change mode when nudged hard enough. Door latches suddenly give way. A gentle pull on a trigger may be ineffective, but there comes a pressure that will suddenly fire the gun. Thermostats tend to activate heating or cooling mechanisms abruptly\u2014also an example of a system that pushes back. We must be careful not to think of an abrupt cooling in response to global warming as just another self-regulatory device, a control system for cooling things down when it gets too hot. The scale of the response will be far beyond the bounds of regulation\u2014more like when excess warming triggers fire extinguishers in the ceiling, ruining the contents of the room while cooling them down. Though combating global warming is obviously on the agenda for preventing a cold flip, we could easily be blindsided by stability problems if we allow global warming per se to remain the main focus of our climate-change efforts. To stabilize our flip-flopping climate we\u2019ll need to identify all the important feedbacks that control climate and ocean currents\u2014evaporation, the reflection of sunlight back into space, and so on\u2014and then estimate their relative strengths and interactions in computer models. Feedbacks are what determine thresholds, where one mode flips into another. Near a threshold one can sometimes observe abortive responses, rather like the act of stepping back onto a curb several times before finally running across a busy street. Abortive responses and rapid chattering between modes are common problems in nonlinear systems with not quite enough oomph\u2014the reason that old fluorescent lights flicker. To keep a bistable system firmly in one state or the other, it should be kept away from the transition threshold. We need to make sure that no business-as-usual climate variation, such as an El Ni\u00f1o or the North Atlantic Oscillation, can push our climate onto the slippery slope and into an abrupt cooling. Of particular importance are combinations of climate variations\u2014this winter, for example, we are experiencing both an El Ni\u00f1o and a North Atlantic Oscillation\u2014because such combinations can add up to much more than the sum of their parts. We are near the end of a warm period in any event; ice ages return even without human influences on climate. The last warm period abruptly terminated 13,000 years after the abrupt warming that initiated it, and we\u2019ve already gone 15,000 years from a similar starting point. But we may be able to do something to delay an abrupt cooling. Do something? This tends to stagger the imagination, immediately conjuring up visions of terraforming on a science-fiction scale\u2014and so we shake our heads and say, \u201cBetter to fight global warming by consuming less,\u201d and so forth. Surprisingly, it may prove possible to prevent flip-flops in the climate\u2014even by means of low-tech schemes. Keeping the present climate from falling back into the low state will in any case be a lot easier than trying to reverse such a change after it has occurred. Were fjord floods causing flushing to fail, because the downwelling sites were fairly close to the fjords, it is obvious that we could solve the problem. All we would need to do is open a channel through the ice dam with explosives before dangerous levels of water built up. Timing could be everything, given the delayed effects from inch-per-second circulation patterns, but that, too, potentially has a low-tech solution: build dams across the major fjord systems and hold back the meltwater at critical times. Or divert eastern-Greenland meltwater to the less sensitive north and west coasts. Fortunately, big parallel computers have proved useful for both global climate modeling and detailed modeling of ocean circulation. They even show the flips. Computer models might not yet be able to predict what will happen if we tamper with downwelling sites, but this problem doesn\u2019t seem insoluble. We need more well-trained people, bigger computers, more coring of the ocean floor and silted-up lakes, more ships to drag instrument packages through the depths, more instrumented buoys to study critical sites in detail, more satellites measuring regional variations in the sea surface, and perhaps some small-scale trial runs of interventions. It would be especially nice to see another dozen major groups of scientists doing climate simulations, discovering the intervention mistakes as quickly as possible and learning from them. Medieval cathedral builders learned from their design mistakes over the centuries, and their undertakings were a far larger drain on the economic resources and people power of their day than anything yet discussed for stabilizing the climate in the twenty-first century. We may not have centuries to spare, but any economy in which two percent of the population produces all the food, as is the case in the United States today, has lots of resources and many options for reordering priorities. Futurists have learned to bracket the future with alternative scenarios, each of which captures important features that cluster together, each of which is compact enough to be seen as a narrative on a human scale. Three scenarios for the next climatic phase might be called population crash, cheap fix, and muddling through. The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands\u2014if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem\u2014and could lead to a Third World War\u2014but Europe\u2019s vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe\u2019s climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic. There is another part of the world with the same good soil, within the same latitudinal band, which we can use for a quick comparison. Canada lacks Europe\u2019s winter warmth and rainfall, because it has no equivalent of the North Atlantic Current to preheat its eastbound weather systems. Canada\u2019s agriculture supports about 28 million people. If Europe had weather like Canada\u2019s, it could feed only one out of twenty-three present-day Europeans. Any abrupt switch in climate would also disrupt food-supply routes. The only reason that two percent of our population can feed the other 98 percent is that we have a well-developed system of transportation and middlemen\u2014but it is not very robust. The system allows for large urban populations in the best of times, but not in the case of widespread disruptions. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes are less troubling than abrupt coolings for two reasons: they\u2019re short (the recovery period starts the next day) and they\u2019re local or regional (unaffected citizens can help the overwhelmed). There is, increasingly, international cooperation in response to catastrophe\u2014but no country is going to be able to rely on a stored agricultural surplus for even a year, and any country will be reluctant to give away part of its surplus. In an abrupt cooling the problem would get worse for decades, and much of the earth would be affected. A meteor strike that killed most of the population in a month would not be as serious as an abrupt cooling that eventually killed just as many. With the population crash spread out over a decade, there would be ample opportunity for civilization\u2019s institutions to be torn apart and for hatreds to build, as armies tried to grab remaining resources simply to feed the people in their own countries. The effects of an abrupt cold last for centuries. They might not be the end of Homo sapiens\u2014written knowledge and elementary education might well endure\u2014but the world after such a population crash would certainly be full of despotic governments that hated their neighbors because of recent atrocities. Recovery would be very slow. A slightly exaggerated version of our present know-something-do-nothing state of affairs is know-nothing-do-nothing: a reduction in science as usual, further limiting our chances of discovering a way out. History is full of withdrawals from knowledge-seeking, whether for reasons of fundamentalism, fatalism, or \u201cgovernment lite\u201d economics. This scenario does not require that the shortsighted be in charge, only that they have enough influence to put the relevant science agencies on starvation budgets and to send recommendations back for yet another commission report due five years hence. A cheap-fix scenario, such as building or bombing a dam, presumes that we know enough to prevent trouble, or to nip a developing problem in the bud. But just as vaccines and antibiotics presume much knowledge about diseases, their climatic equivalents presume much knowledge about oceans, atmospheres, and past climates. Suppose we had reports that winter salt flushing was confined to certain areas, that abrupt shifts in the past were associated with localized flushing failures, andthat one computer model after another suggested a solution that was likely to work even under a wide range of weather extremes. A quick fix, such as bombing an ice dam, might then be possible. Although I don\u2019t consider this scenario to be the most likely one, it is possible that solutions could turn out to be cheap and easy, and that another abrupt cooling isn\u2019t inevitable. Fatalism, in other words, might well be foolish. A muddle-through scenario assumes that we would mobilize our scientific and technological resources well in advance of any abrupt cooling problem, but that the solution wouldn\u2019t be simple. Instead we would try one thing after another, creating a patchwork of solutions that might hold for another few decades, allowing the search for a better stabilizing mechanism to continue. We might, for example, anchor bargeloads of evaporation-enhancing surfactants (used in the southwest corner of the Dead Sea to speed potash production) upwind from critical downwelling sites, letting winds spread them over the ocean surface all winter, just to ensure later flushing. We might create a rain shadow, seeding clouds so that they dropped their unsalted water well upwind of a given year\u2019s critical flushing sites\u2014a strategy that might be particularly important in view of the increased rainfall expected from global warming. We might undertake to regulate the Mediterranean\u2019s salty outflow, which is also thought to disrupt the North Atlantic Current. Perhaps computer simulations will tell us that the only robust solutions are those that re-create the ocean currents of three million years ago, before the Isthmus of Panama closed off the express route for excess-salt disposal. Thus we might dig a wide sea-level Panama Canal in stages, carefully managing the changeover. Stabilizing our flip-flopping climate is not a simple matter. We need heat in the right places, such as the Greenland Sea, and not in others right next door, such as Greenland itself. Man-made global warming is likely to achieve exactly the opposite\u2014warming Greenland and cooling the Greenland Sea. A remarkable amount of specious reasoning is often encountered when we contemplate reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. That increased quantities of greenhouse gases will lead to global warming is as solid a scientific prediction as can be found, but other things influence climate too, and some people try to escape confronting the consequences of our pumping more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by supposing that something will come along miraculously to counteract them. Volcanos spew sulfates, as do our own smokestacks, and these reflect some sunlight back into space, particularly over the North Atlantic and Europe. But we can\u2019t assume that anything like this will counteract our longer-term flurry of carbon-dioxide emissions. Only the most naive gamblers bet against physics, and only the most irresponsible bet with their grandchildren\u2019s resources. To the long list of predicted consequences of global warming\u2014stronger storms, methane release , habitat changes, ice-sheet melting, rising seas , stronger El Ni\u00f1os, killer heat waves\u2014we must now add an abrupt, catastrophic cooling. Whereas the familiar consequences of global warming will force expensive but gradual adjustments, the abrupt cooling promoted by man-made warming looks like a particularly efficient means of committing mass suicide. We cannot avoid trouble by merely cutting down on our present warming trend, though that\u2019s an excellent place to start. Paleoclimatic records reveal that any notion we may once have had that the climate will remain the same unless pollution changes it is wishful thinking. Judging from the duration of the last warm period, we are probably near the end of the current one. Our goal must be to stabilize the climate in its favorable mode and ensure that enough equatorial heat continues to flow into the waters around Greenland and Norway. A stabilized climate must have a wide \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d and be able to survive the El Ni\u00f1os of the short term. We can design for that in computer models of climate, just as architects design earthquake-resistant skyscrapers. Implementing it might cost no more, in relative terms, than building a medieval cathedral. But we may not have centuries for acquiring wisdom, and it would be wise to compress our learning into the years immediately ahead. We have to discover what has made the climate of the past 8,000 years relatively stable, and then figure out how to prop it up.","headline":"The Great Climate Flip-Flop","article_name":308313.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/1998\/01\/the-great-climate-flip-flop\/308313\/","date_published":"1998-01-03 18:35:26","article_length":39778,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:06.832907","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/1998\/01\/the-great-climate-flip-flop\/308313\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"There are no easy solutions to global warming, but progress is on the horizon. If we're to avoid destructive climate fluctuations, scientists say we need to slow, and eventually halt, the emission of\u00a0 greenhouse gases \u00a0that do and will continue to produce global warming. A big chunk of our emissions come from the consumption of the fossil fuels\u00a0-- the coal, oil and gas that remain a crucial part of keeping the modern economy running. Not an easy task. Let's look at which fuels, and countries, produce the highest levels of carbon dioxide pollution, and how we can try to rein these emissions in. In the United States green advocates are concerned about the climate impacts of all manner of new fossil fuel developments, but there is one culprit that stands above the rest. Potential emissions from increased\u00a0 oil production , more\u00a0 shale gas drilling, new\u00a0 pipelines , and exotic fuels pale in comparison to the possible carbon impact from coal reserves. Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and it's cheap. China is consuming more coal every year, dwarfing the progress made in green energy elsewhere. And it will struggle to move away from this dependence, even as it pours money into renewables. Finding a way to provide affordable renewable energy on a large-scale will be a necessary piece of making a major dent in carbon emissions. American energy policy is supportive of investment in renewables, extending tax credits and seed funding to clean energy companies, from the\u00a0 successful \u00a0 Tesla Motors, to the not-so-successful flop of Solyndra . This government finance for green start-ups has both  detractors  and supporters , but even without state support, the lower costs of renewable technologies are making the industry more and more attractive to private investment . Renewables are an important piece of the puzzle, but come with their own obstacles. Solar and wind are intermittent energy sources around which wholly reliable systems have not been developed. The conventional grid isn't designed to deal with this. A possible solution is to build a\u00a0 nationally integrated , smarter \u00a0grid to match energy supply across regions more exactly to demand. This would allow customers to see their energy consumption more clearly, and utilities to prevent blackouts more easily. It has its own share of concerns, not least of which are how to protect an online grid against\u00a0 security  threats . Consumers are also  anxious  about big data being used to infringe privacy and hike prices. The shift to a smarter grid has already been made in some places like\u00a0 Florida , but is still in its early stages across the rest of the U.S. and the globe. It's an area where China is forging ahead rapidly . Climate change is global, in both the scope of its problems, and the sources of its solutions -- it should be addressed globally. In terms of the blame game, there are no easy targets. China is now the world's biggest emitter, but\u00a0 U.S. emissions remain high, and historically America is by far the largest polluter. Few would disagree that America ought to bear a bigger burden of carbon-mitigation measures, but, to make an impact on climate change, the effort must be worldwide. That's why investment in renewable energy and smarter grids needs to be complemented by a globally binding emissions treaty. The U.S. and China recently took baby-steps towards co-operation by agreeing to phase out harmful gases called hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), but many\u00a0 remain  skeptical about the prospects for a treaty down the line. If a treaty were enacted, countries would need to impose a carbon price -- maybe through a tax or a cap-and trade system -- to limit pollution. So far, Congress hasn't passed any such legislation, despite considerable support at times. Obama is using executive authority to curb emissions. For now, an IEA report sets its sights a little lower, but even the measures it recommends may be  difficult to implement  or less effective than hoped. While the short-term politics look grim, taking a longer perspective, governments have helped push along the development of substantially cheaper solar and wind power, as well as supporting many other types of energy experiments. As the prices have come down, switching to cleaner power sources has become easier and the development of these industries has generated some interesting political constituencies like, say, wind farmers in Iowa , a key electoral state. The point is: Energy transitions take a long time, and not just for technical reasons. But that doesn't mean they don't happen.","headline":"The Complexities of Climate Change","article_name":278579.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/08\/the-complexities-of-climate-change\/278579\/","date_published":"2013-08-12 16:07:30","article_length":4576,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:07.092010","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/08\/the-complexities-of-climate-change\/278579\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Don\u2019t depersonalize climate change. My newly adopted home state is on fire again: Scorching heat and lightning strikes have sparked dozens of fires across California, burning an area the size of Rhode Island. Iowa is reeling from a deadly derecho. The Mountain West is suffering through a severe drought . Towns and cities all over are experiencing one of the hottest summers on record, if not the hottest . And a hurricane just tore through the Gulf Coast. With climate change making extreme weather events more intense and more common, and Congress continuing to ignore this existential threat, I have tried to do my part. After moving to California, I went on a no-buy streak. I began refusing short plane trips, using public transit or walking whenever possible, and turning the air-conditioning down. I even started carrying around a water bottle or a mason jar. Could it be that my decision to go green is pointless, or even harmful? \u201cPerformative environmentalism\u201d is more about personal virtue than saving the planet, says the writer s.e. smith in a searing essay , and puts the focus on the micro and futile rather than the macro and important. Polluters have convinced us that it is consumers\u2019 fault, argues the activist George Monbiot, who also argues that we cannot buy our way out of a crisis caused by untrammeled consumption. Neoliberalism has wrested the responsibility for environmental action from the C-suite and the statehouse to the individual home, says the journalist Martin Lukacs. No less an authority than Michael Mann, the renowned climatologist, has made a version of this same argument , as have many , many  other  thinkers . Companies are where the fault lies, the argument goes: Just 20 of them are responsible for 35 percent of global emissions since 1965, according to a report by Richard Heede of the Climate Accountability Institute. \u201cThe corporations blame the consumers,\u201d Heede told me in an interview. \u201cThey say, \u2018We\u2019re just the producers. We\u2019re satisfying public demand.\u2019\u201d But those companies confuse the public, sow distrust of climate science, and impede policy changes in order to keep profiting while the world burns. Governments are where true salvation lies, the argument continues: There is no real hope for keeping global warming below those all-important targets without raising the price of carbon, lowering the price of green energy, and pushing subsidies and other policies to get the world to adapt and decarbonize as fast as possible. Political action in the United States is what matters, for the country and the world. The critics are right that focusing on individuals is a grave error if it obscures corporate culpability and systemic solutions. But I\u2019m not about to get rid of my canvas bags and mason jars, buy a second car, or start taking short flights again. Talking with economists, climate scientists, and psychologists convinced me that depersonalizing climate change, such that the only answers are systemic, is a mistake of its own. It misses how social change is built on a foundation of individual practice. On one point, the experts agree: In terms of the pencil-to-paper carbon math, no matter how much of an emitter you are\u2014flying around the world on a private jet, keeping several houses cooled to 62 degrees in the summer and warmed to 75 in the winter, eating Argentinian filet and French champagne at every meal\u2014your contribution to climate change is minuscule and any consumption changes you might make even more so. Recycling, cutting back on driving, and changing out old light bulbs for energy-efficient ones might save half a ton of carbon a year. A household going car-free, flight-free, and vegan\u2014changes impractical, if not outright impossible, for many families to make\u2014might reduce emissions by four tons a year . The world needs to slash emissions by tens of billions of tons annually, which categorically requires government investment and government regulations. But the case for doing something, anything, everything for the future of the planet at a household level is not about long division. \u201cIt is a false debate within the climate-activist community,\u201d Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist at NASA, told me, speaking on his own behalf. \u201cThe canard is this either\/or, collective or individual, and [that] individual [change] is a distraction. If the only effect is in keeping an individual\u2019s carbon-dioxide molecules out of the atmosphere, that\u2019s correct. But that\u2019s less than 1 percent of the reason to take action.\u201d Each individual may not matter. But individuals collectively matter, and consumer culture matters. Shifting mores and norms would help curb emissions, and would make drastic political action more likely. The behavioral-science literature makes clear that human beings are more like middle schoolers at a semiformal than Aristotelian judges in chambers. We do not act according to pure reason. We are highly sensitive to what the people around us are doing or thinking or talking about, and behave accordingly, whether it comes to having a kid , having more kids , getting a tattoo , taking paternity leave , binge drinking in college , paying a fair share of taxes , finding a person hot , committing a violent assault , donating to charity , being happy , being depressed , developing an eating disorder, laughing , or smoking cigarettes . Among humans, just about everything goes viral. Social scientists do not just think that the same is true when it comes to helping the environment and stemming climate change. They know that it is true. Take the example of the sport utility vehicle. Annual sales of these boxy gas guzzlers have soared in recent decades ; just 8 percent of American consumers chose SUVs as of 1992, and more than 40 percent choose them today. As the Cornell University economist Robert H. Frank notes in his book Under the Influence , that shift was not due to some intrinsic need on the part of American consumers. The population grew in dense urban areas and shrank in sparse rural ones over that time, and labor growth happened in the white-collar and service sectors. Families got smaller at the same time too. SUVs got popular because they were perceived as cool and rich people started buying them, and nobody cared a whit about the carbon impact. Frank traces the trend to the 1992 Tim Robbins film The Player , of all things: \u201cSeeing a wealthy studio executive behind the wheel of a Range Rover instantly certified it as a player\u2019s vehicle of choice. As more and more high-income buyers purchased them, their allure grew,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen other automakers began offering similar vehicles at lower prices, SUV sales took off. And with each driver who bought an SUV instead of a car, gasoline consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions increased further.\u201d If viral buying can hurt the environment, it can help it, too. Putting solar panels on your house is infectious : A study from California showed that a single house installing rooftop solar panels increased the probability of another house in the same zip code doing so by .78 percentage points. The propensity to conserve water and recycle is social too. \u201cPeople see that their neighbors are putting their [recycling bins] out, and they become more likely to do that,\u201d Robert Gifford, a psychologist who studies environmental behaviors at the University of Victoria, told me. \u201cSeeing what your friends and neighbors are doing can make a big difference in people\u2019s behavior.\u201d Trying to reduce your household recycling and waste burden, using public transit, offering plant-based meal options at work and social events, refusing to fly to the family reunion: It stands to reason that all of those behaviors are catching as well. Last year, the \u201cflight shame\u201d movement swelled in Europe, bolstered by the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. A UBS study of 6,000 people in the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom found that one in five said they had reduced the number of air trips they took based on climate concerns. Germany attributes a measurable drop in air traffic to the phenomenon . Researchers believe that these kinds of household-led trends can help avert climate catastrophe, even if government and corporate actions are far more important. Community practices really do count. \u201cIf 5 percent of Americans bought carbon offsets or changed other [carbon-intensive] behaviors, that would add up to a reduction of 600 million tons of carbon dioxide a year,\u201d Brett Jenks, the president of Rare, a global conservation nonprofit, told me. \u201cThat would put it on a short list of the top changes in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions in human history,\u201d along with the adoption of the Montreal Protocol , which banned certain chemicals and helped save the ozone layer. Getting people to act better on the climate might get them to think better on the climate too, bolstering their political interest in fixing the problem. To borrow a phrase commonly used in social-psychology textbooks (and in addiction support groups), people often act their way to better thoughts, rather than thinking their way to better actions. Getting people to ride a bike for errands might make them care about the environment, just as caring for the environment might get them to ride a bike. Little actions have a way of becoming big actions through something psychologists call the \u201c foot-in-the-door \u201d phenomenon. In one experiment, conducted in the 1960s, researchers asked one set of Californians to put up huge Drive Carefully signs in their yards. Only one in five said yes. They asked a second set to put up a small sign about safe driving in their front windows or in their car. They were then asked to put up the large Drive Carefully yard sign as well. Three in four went along. They were already \u201cdrive carefully\u201d people, after all. Research from development also suggests that doing works better than showing works better than telling . Jerry Sternin is a former Harvard Business School professor and staff member at the nonprofit Save the Children. Back in the 1990s, he was tasked with trying to end childhood malnutrition in extremely poor communities in Vietnam. Sternin and his colleagues identified mothers who were already keeping their kids nourished. They had volunteers learn those practices and share them with a few neighbors, by having them come over to cook with them . Sternin found the \u201c positive deviants\u201d in a community and figured out how not just to amplify their practices, but to get those practices to stick in whole villages. In some cases, malnutrition declined 65 to 85 percent. What communities do, laws reflect\u2014this is another reason to act on climate change, and urgently. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a society, where people interact with companies, companies interact with the government, and people interact with the government. And in all of these cases, the interactions go both ways,\u201d Jonathan Gilligan, a physicist and a climate-change researcher at Vanderbilt University, told me. \u201cEach part influences another.\u201d Many climate activists believe that changing social norms around carbon-intensive behaviors makes the likelihood of dramatic climate-change legislation in the future more likely, not less. Indeed, changing social mores often wend their ways into laws. Animal-rights activists moved against fur wearing in the 1980s, and raised awareness about how cruel the practice is for the broad public. Now that the trade is much diminished and far more niche, cities are finally enacting bans on new fur sales. Or consider drunk-driving legislation. Mothers Against Drunk Driving was crucial in reframing alcohol-related car \u201caccidents\u201d as criminal incidents, and pushing hundreds of policy changes that slashed the share of traffic fatalities involving alcohol . Generally, research indicates that laws and regulations often work better when they reflect what a populace is already doing or how it is already changing, rather than trying to force a populace to change. The economists Daron Acemoglu of MIT and Matthew Jackson of Stanford tackled the phenomenon in a paper , starting with a great anecdote. France outlawed duelling in the early 17th century, but the practice, \u201ca key pillar of the social norms of French military officers and aristocrats,\u201d remained common, killing 4,000 officers during a three-decade period in which it was putatively prohibited. The ban backfired, the economists argued, as many strict and sudden laws do. To make a climate legal regime work, it might help to tighten laws gradually. It also might help for individuals to start acting in anticipation of those laws. Rules requiring solar power, regulations encouraging electric cars, taxes on meat\u2014they would be easier to pass and less painful to adhere to if more people were using solar power, driving electric cars, and buying less meat to begin with. Action makes activists, and the world needs consumers not just to behave more responsibly when it comes to the climate, but to understand the survival-of-the-species urgency of the unfolding catastrophe. \u201cI am absolutely terrified. What\u2019s happening to the Earth system, it is happening so much faster than I thought it would,\u201d said Kalmus of NASA. \u201cThe observations, the interpretations, the projections from the climate model\u2014when I translate that into the emotional part of my brain, what I feel is panic and terror. I struggle to breathe sometimes. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and I just feel like there\u2019s no place to hide. I can\u2019t do enough to wake people up.\u201d When you feel that way, you want to act in accordance with that belief, he said, and acting in accordance with that belief underscores how serious the problem is. \u201cMy desire to fly?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s negative.\u201d People who make the case for not worrying about changing your personal habits, and instead insisting that the government do its job, push back against the above arguments in a few ways. One is by citing what is often called \u201cself-licensing\u201d or \u201cmoral licensing\u201d: the thing that makes people order a fancy, sugary coffee drink after hitting the gym, or spend money on new clothes after getting through their paperwork. After doing something \u201cgood,\u201d people tend to then do something \u201cbad\u201d: Ethical behavior induces later unethical behavior; moral behavior induces immoral behavior; green behavior induces not-green behavior. Studies have shown that people who save water, for instance, then increase their electricity consumption. Getting people to do better at home, it follows, might have a null overall effect on their carbon emissions. A more serious concern is that taking little, statistically meaningless actions to help the environment might reduce people\u2019s interest in fixing the problem at a societal and governmental level. People might think: I\u2019m cutting my emissions, and the people around me are cutting their emissions. We\u2019re getting it done! One study found that using \u201cnudges\u201d to encourage people to use green energy diminished their support for a carbon tax. Research also suggests that personal beliefs about the climate are not always indicative of environmental behaviors. A University of Michigan study found that people who were not convinced on climate change \u201cwere most likely to report engaging in individual-level, pro-environmental behaviors,\u201d and that people who were most concerned were least likely to do so. But psychologists and climate experts push back on all of that pushback, and hard. For one, moral licensing does not mean that people cannot and do not meaningfully reduce their carbon impact. \u201cOur team of behavioral economists and social-science researchers\u2014they found that moral licensing is a thing, full stop,\u201d said Jenks, the president of Rare. \u201cBut the impacts are very small. And when you look at the size and scope of impacts needed to get published as a result, they have a very low bar for significance statistically.\u201d Gifford, the psychologist who focuses on personal actions and climate change, added that moral licensing creates a \u201cnegative spillover\u201d from a given behavioral change. But \u201cpositive spillovers\u201d happen too. On net, the positive often outweighs the negative. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of research about this, and it\u2019s contradictory mainly because there are different kinds of behaviors and different kinds of people,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is three steps forward and two steps backward. You get more steps forward than backwards.\u201d As for whether focusing on personal actions undercuts the case for political actions\u2014again, countervailing research points in the other direction. Even that \u201cnudge\u201d study found that simply telling people in advance that a carbon tax is more effective than a renewable-energy program leads people to support both initiatives . That finding gets at a way to improve messaging on the climate crisis: Activists could stress that personal climate responsibility needs to come alongside policies such as carbon taxes, electric-vehicle mandates, and so on. Finally, personal action might help climate action out of the political trap it already finds itself in. Right now, many Republicans oppose climate legislation in part because Democrats want it; negative partisanship is making compromise impossible. \u201cPrivate initiatives might build support and inroads with people who have traditionally been really opposed to the government taking action on the climate,\u201d Gilligan, the climate researcher, told me. If government action is one of many policy avenues, and if everyone is already taking action to save the planet, the issue might become more bipartisan. What should individuals do to fight the atmospheric warming that\u2019s spinning off hurricanes and lighting fires and causing droughts across the country? How can individuals help create a culture that will eliminate the nightmare of climate change? Consumers are bombarded with inaccurate and contradictory messages about human impact on the natural world. Most Americans, when asked what they should be doing, talk about recycling, Jenks said\u2014the result, in part, of a multi-decade campaign by waste-management companies. Recycling is good to do. But \u201creduce\u201d and \u201creuse\u201d are more important behaviors, and recycling is not a crucial household-level behavior one way or another. The country could use far more potent and urgent norms when it comes to emissions-heavy behaviors, he told me. And the time is ripe for creating them. \u201cFrom our own research, more than 50 percent of Americans would like to do something personally about climate change,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut they don\u2019t know that anybody else expects them to do anything. We call that in social sciences an \u2018expectations gap.\u2019 People expect they should be doing something, but they don\u2019t yet know that others expect them to do something.\u201d The best \u201csomethings\u201d to do include adopting a plant-rich diet, buying carbon offsets (though there is some controversy about that), using renewable energy at home, wasting less food, using mass transit, and flying far less often. Your furnace, your car, your commute, your vacations, your lunch: That\u2019s where change needs to happen. Wealthy Americans, who are far worse emitters than their poorer counterparts, need to shift their behavior most dramatically and receive the most social sanction. Pressuring the political system is another crucial behavior. At a local level, demanding dense, walkable neighborhoods and abundant, low-cost public transit is a good start. But the Senate and the Supreme Court\u2014heavily politicized, antidemocratic, and counter-majoritarian bodies\u2014are the most potent obstacles to drastic, immediate climate action. Calling your swing-state senator to press for the abolition of the filibuster, getting out the vote in purple states, donating to pro-climate candidates: These might be among the most important things that individuals can do. Get terrified, and act like it. That\u2019s what our species needs to do to survive, and to help save the trillions of other creatures mortally endangered on this planet. But go ahead and enjoy your coffee in a reusable container while doing it.","headline":"All That Performative Environmentalism Adds Up","article_name":615817.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/your-tote-bag-can-make-difference\/615817\/","date_published":"2020-08-31 10:00:00","article_length":20104,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:07.670306","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/your-tote-bag-can-make-difference\/615817\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"But two simple changes can help. What\u2019s for dinner? On a planet wracked by rising seas, expanding deserts, withering biodiversity, and hotter temperatures, that\u2019s a fraught question to answer. Food production accounts for roughly a quarter of the world\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions, and scientists have found that limiting global warming will be impossible without significant changes to how the world eats . At the same time, climate change is threatening the world\u2019s food supply, with land and water being exploited at an \u201cunprecedented\u201d pace. Reforming the food system to save the planet is going to require new corporate practices, and new laws and regulations at the national and international levels. But individual consumer behaviors matter as well\u2014more than you might think. Your diet is likely one of your biggest sources of climate emissions. But what should you do ? Eat locally? Get your food from small-scale farmers? Choose organics and fair trade? Avoid processed foods? Eat seasonally? The choices are many; the stakes are high. But experts on land use, climate change, and sustainable agriculture told me that two habits tower above all others in terms of environmental impact. To help save the planet, quit wasting food and eat less meat. Read: You\u2019re thinking about home heating wrong The conservation nonprofit Rare analyzed a sweeping set of climate-change mitigation strategies in 2019. It found that getting households to recycle, switch to LED lighting and hybrid vehicles, and add rooftop solar systems would save less than half the carbon emissions combined than would reducing food waste and adopting a plant-based diet. Let\u2019s begin with the role of food waste. Americans waste a lot of food. Nearly one-third of it , in fact. More than 130 billion pounds a year, worth roughly $160 billion. We throw away enough food to close our own \u201cmeal gap\u201d eight times over. Food is the single biggest component of our country\u2019s landfills , and the average American sends more than 200 pounds of food there every year. More than 1,250 calories per person a day, or more than 140 trillion calories a year, get tossed in the garbage. Households, not restaurants or schools or corporate cafeterias, are the dominant wasters. The problem is worse in the United States than in most other countries, and it has worsened over time. When you toss a spoiled chicken breast or moldy tomato into the trash, you\u2019re wasting a greenhouse-gas-intensive product. You\u2019re also sending it to a landfill, where it will emit methane. Addressing food waste would be low-hanging fruit: The country could save money, emit less carbon into the atmosphere, alleviate the burden on landfills, reduce the number of animals subjected to life on a factory farm, and address its hunger crisis just by eating all the food it makes. Households consuming more of what they buy, and thus buying less, would have a major effect on the whole food system. Food suppliers would produce less to meet the country\u2019s more efficient demand. Supermarkets would stock less food. Fewer trucks would need to run from plant to store. Fewer refrigerators would be needed in stores and industrial facilities to keep groceries cold. Fewer cows would fill up feedlots. Fewer acres of corn and soy would be grown to feed them. How to do it? For one, get wise about expiration labels and quit throwing out perfectly good food. Research shows that nearly all Americans misinterpret date labels and toss their groceries out prematurely, for fear of food poisoning, and understandably so. Retailers and production companies use 50 different Use By \u2013type labels, and none is federally regulated, except for those on infant formula. Sell By stamps tend to be for inventory management, and have nothing to do with food safety; Best If Used By and Use By stamps tend to be about freshness and food quality, not whether you are about to enjoy a serving of mycotoxins. As a general point, most food is safe to eat as long as there is no evident spoilage, such as visible mold or an off smell. \u201cUse your senses,\u201d says Yvette Cabrera of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the conservation nonprofit, noting that those senses were refined through millennia of natural selection in no small part to help us figure out whether food is safe to eat. Read: Kill your gas stove Experts also point to a series of simple, old-fashioned techniques households can use to ensure that they eat more of the food they buy. They amount to thinking like your Depression-era forebears, pretty much. Figure out appropriate portion sizes; eat your leftovers; store food in appropriate containers and at the right temperature; prepare and freeze perishables instead of letting them linger and go bad; and shop in your refrigerator and cabinet before you hit the store. And when you\u2019re at the store, there is one dietary change to consider that beats all others in terms of its climate impact. It is not eating locally or seasonally. It is not eating organic or fair-trade. It is not eating unprocessed foods or avoiding big-box and fast-food retailers. It is eating less meat. Roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s farmland is used to pasture livestock or raise crops to feed that livestock. That contributes to deforestation, destroys the planet\u2019s natural carbon sinks, erodes the planet\u2019s biodiversity , and uses up fresh water. The main, mooing offender is beef . Cattle are responsible for roughly two-thirds of the livestock sector\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions , while beef and dairy products are responsible for about one-tenth of global emissions overall. Gram for gram, beef produces roughly eight times more greenhouse-gas emissions than farmed fish or poultry, 12 times more than eggs, 25 times more than tofu, and even more compared with pulses, nuts, root vegetables, bananas, potatoes, bread, or maize. Beef is so bad for two reasons, Michael Clark, a scholar of food systems and health at the University of Oxford, explained to me. The first is that it takes a lot of inputs to produce beef as an output: about 20 kilograms of corn and soy protein to produce one kilogram of beef, he said. The second is that cows produce methane as they digest their food. \u201cOther types of animals don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\u201d Trading your rib eyes and cheesesteaks for lentils and tofu is one of the best things you can do as a consumer for the environment; if all Americans did, the country would be roughly halfway to hitting its Paris Agreement targets . Still, the all-or-nothing way the choice is often presented is a mistake. There is enormous acreage between the Atkins diet, or even the meat-heavy diet of the average American, and full-on veganism, which remains a niche lifestyle choice that few follow for long. Better all Americans cut meat consumption by 40 percent than 3 percent of Americans cut it out completely. Experts encourage taking small, meaningful steps to reduce your meat consumption, and trying to find some joy in doing it. Participate in Meatless Monday ; try learning to cook dishes from a plant-heavy cuisine you like; offer a vegetarian option at work events; opt for dishes where meat plays a supporting, rather than leading, role. Read: Beyond \u201cvegetarian\u201d After wasting less food and eating less meat, all other changes a person might make are marginal, experts said, among them eating locally, organically, and seasonally. Moreover, the climate impact of those food choices is in many cases contradictory. \u201cI work in food, and it\u2019s confusing for me,\u201d Cabrera, of the NRDC, told me. \u201cIs this lettuce better than this lettuce? Consumers are faced with so many choices, and it is really hard to know.\u201d Humanely raised, local meat, for instance, can produce more emissions than meat coming from a concentrated industrial operation, Clark told me. Cows in concentrated animal-feeding operations are generally slaughtered at 12 to 18 months of age, while cows raised exclusively on pastures typically live twice as long. \u201cThe cow that lives for longer is going to emit more methane over the course of its lifespan,\u201d he said, though he added that there were still compelling reasons to opt for the local beef. Similarly, growing a given amount of organic produce usually requires more emissions and acres of land than growing the same amount using conventional farming methods. One study conducted in Sweden, for instance, showed that organic peas and wheat have a bigger climate impact than their conventionally farmed cousins. That said, when it comes to the emissions related to shipping food around the world, experts argue that\u2014surprisingly\u2014local is not always better. There\u2019s a certain uncanny decadence to eating Peruvian avocados and Chinese grapes in the dead of winter, or opening a bottle of French Beaujolais or a package of Scottish smoked salmon at will. But transporting food around the world tends to make up only a small share of a given product\u2019s total greenhouse-gas emissions. What you are eating and how it was farmed is far more important than how it got to you, and imported food typically has a low carbon impact. For all that, experts said there are good reasons to opt for organic, locally produced, seasonal food, even if it might not be as efficient to produce, or might not have the lowest greenhouse-gas emissions. Many smaller-scale operations outside Big Ag produce food without pesticides, without monoculture, with manure instead of chemical fertilizers, and with respect for biodiversity and soil health. Those are all important facets of environmental preservation too. Complicating things, what\u2019s good for the environment isn\u2019t always what\u2019s good for animal welfare. When it comes to eating animals, \u201cunfortunately, the cruelty scale is the flip of the emissions scale,\u201d Leah Garc\u00e9s, the president of Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit that advocates for better conditions for animals raised in industrial environments, told me. A family can easily eat a chicken in a single night, but might struggle to eat a whole cow over the course of a year. Moreover, transportation and processing is much rougher on birds, which have delicate bodies. (Each year, more than 1 million chickens die en route to slaughter, and half a million are not actually dead when they hit the scalding tank.) For these reasons, a chicken breast represents much more suffering than a steak, even though the steak is worse for the planet. But the fact remains: The fewer animals you eat, the fewer die, and the better off the planet is. Diets that are good for the planet tend to be good for people too. Research by Clark and his colleagues has shown that foods associated with good health generally have low environmental impacts, \u201cindicating that the same dietary transitions that would lower incidences of noncommunicable diseases would also help meet environmental sustainability targets.\u201d Our diets are cooking the planet, and changing them, even in small ways, might help avert catastrophe. A burger for lunch, a bag of wilted greens in the trash\u2014these may not be as obviously destructive to the environment as a private jet or a gas-guzzling car. But they are choices we make daily, and they matter.","headline":"Your Diet Is Cooking the Planet","article_name":618515.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2021\/04\/rules-eating-fight-climate-change\/618515\/","date_published":"2021-04-06 10:00:00","article_length":11232,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:08.548072","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2021\/04\/rules-eating-fight-climate-change\/618515\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The idea that malaria and climate change are strongly connected still has wide currency among casual environmentalists, even though those who know what they are talking about have been quietly retreating from this position for some time. The Economist draws my attention to a new article in Nature which might help the withdrawal along: One of the main thrusts of the new Nature paper... is to see how much of what happened to the spread of malaria in the 20th century can be explained by what happened to the climate. The answer, according to Peter Gething of Oxford University and his colleagues there and in Florida, is not much. They conclude that claims that a warming climate has led to more widespread disease and death due to malaria are largely at odds with the evidence, which shows the areas effected shrinking, and the size of the effect shrinking too... Those thinking about the overall danger that climate change represents should not spend their time worrying about its impact on malaria. I recommend The Economist piece. It goes on to make interesting wider points about science-based models (of climate change, in particular, but not only of climate change) and the predictions drawn from them. One lesson is especially worth remembering. Pretty much every paper presenting a biology-based model of malaria's dependence on climate contains a warning that changes in economy, technology and society matter too, and aren't in the model. The lesson: don't regard such caveats as empty disclaimers to be ignored - like, say, the small print on a mortgage application. They may matter very much. One must take them seriously. In other environmental news, see this note on Steve McIntyre's reception at a recent gathering of climate-change skeptics. McIntyre, of course, is the tireless scourge of slipshod climate science. But as any open-minded reader of Climate Audit would have expected, he has no interest in leading a lynch mob. So he got a standing ovation when he came in, and tepid applause at the end. Good for him.

{"id":null,"body":"As UN climate negotiations faltered, bankers on Wall Street brought good news for the climate. What\u2019s even happening? So let\u2019s say you have one (1) global economy. It currently generates most of its energy by burning carbon-based fuels, which is fine, but then it disposes the resulting carbon-dioxide pollution in the air, wreaking all sorts of general havoc too extensive to recount here, which is not as fine. Naturally you might want to wean your economy off carbon fuels. But how to do it? For the last quarter century, the world has tried to do it through meetings, lovingly dubbed COPs, or \u201cconferences of the parties.\u201d The parties in question are countries that have ratified the United Nations\u2019 1994 framework treaty on climate change. Every major UN climate negotiation since then has been a COP: The 2015 Paris Agreement, which encourages countries to decarbonize their economies over time, was finalized at COP21. The most recent COP, the 25th, ended on Sunday. It ran two days longer than planned and went, by most accounts, very poorly. \u201cThere is no sugarcoating it: The negotiations fell far short of what was expected,\u201d said a vice president of the World Resources Institute, a nonpartisan environmental think tank, in a statement . Corporate Accountability, a progressive advocacy firm, decried the result: \u201cCOP25 failed to rise to the challenge of our time.\u201d Even the staid New York Times, in its headline, bemoaned \u201cfew commitments and a \u2018lost\u2019 opportunity\u201d at the meeting. What happened? This year, negotiators were supposed to be finishing the \u201crule book\u201d for the Paris Agreement while preparing for next year\u2019s COP, when countries are supposed to announce more ambitious promises under that treaty. But problems arose on both issues. Read: Dozens of states want to keep America\u2019s broken climate promise First, on the rule book: The Paris Agreement sketches the possibility of trading carbon pollution across borders, and diplomats cannot agree on exactly how to structure it. Some countries\u2014notably Brazil\u2014want to use \u201cbanked\u201d credits from the previous international climate regime, the Kyoto Protocol, under the Paris treaty. But most other countries regard this, rightly, as a loophole. (And experts are doubtful that Kyoto\u2019s carbon-trading mechanism really prevented that many emissions: There are rumors of elaborate gamesmanship of its accounting rules.) Simultaneously, the United States and other big polluters fought off specific terms for \u201closs and damage\u201d compensation, the amount of money they owe poorer countries who didn\u2019t contribute much to climate change but are now swept up in its whirlwind. Second, on the ambition: It is not clear that China and India, two of the world\u2019s most carbon-intensive economies, will announce broader climate promises at next year\u2019s COP. These two countries hold the future of the world in their hands. And right now, they are handling that duty by waiting to see if the United States\u2014which remains the world\u2019s largest carbon polluter on a per-person basis \u2014intends to get serious about climate change again. For better or worse, China and India will soon get a giant hint about American intentions: Immediately before the next COP begins, voters will either ratify or reject President Donald Trump\u2019s carbonist stance in the 2020 election. Read: Trump isn\u2019t a climate denier. He\u2019s worse. How bad is all of this? It\u2019s worth separating out two different issues\u2014the relatively arcane question of carbon markets, which I will stop talking about after this paragraph, and the larger direction of climate diplomacy. On the first issue, the Harvard economist Robert Stavins is generally a fan of carbon markets , yet he says that no deal is better than a bad deal : Far better that countries work out good accounting rules privately than be required to honor a globally binding loophole that benefits Brazil. Bentley Allan , a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University who is much more skeptical of carbon markets, agrees with him. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for bad actors to veto this stuff and make everything feel hopeless when there\u2019s no need for that,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe narrative that the COP is a failure because they hadn\u2019t agreed to anything under [the carbon-trading rules] is ridiculous.\u201d Okay, but what about the larger direction of climate diplomacy? For the most helpful clue, it was best on Sunday not to look to Madrid, where the climate negotiations were wrapping up, but to New York, where a different kind of global governance was unfolding. This weekend, the investment bank Goldman Sachs updated its rules about when and how it would underwrite fossil-fuel projects. Goldman will now refuse to finance oil exploration or drilling in the Arctic, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. It will also decline to finance new thermal coal mines, mountaintop-removal mines, or coal-fired power plants. Generally, banks both lend capital directly to fossil-fuel companies and connect those companies with third-party investors. Goldman says its ban applies to both kinds of activity. While other banks around the world\u2014 including Barclays and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2014have adopted similar policies, Goldman Sachs is both the first American bank and the largest bank by market value to do so. Goldman also committed to spend $750 billion on a number of clean-energy and climate-adjacent areas over the next 10 years. And David Solomon, the bank\u2019s chief executive, called for countries to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in an editorial in the Financial Times. There\u2019s an understandable tendency to minimize these corporate calls for climate action: Many oil-company CEOs also officially endorse a carbon tax, for instance, even though the oil industry\u2019s trade group fights against it at every opportunity. But Goldman\u2019s actions seem like a much bigger deal. Over the previous decade, about $1 trillion has moved into the clean-energy economy through climate bonds, according to data from the Climate Bonds Initiative analyzed by Allan, the political scientist. While Goldman\u2019s new lending will not take the form of climate bonds, its $750 billion figure will still single-handedly double that level of private funding for climate-mitigation and adaptation over the next decade. As Allan put it: \u201cIt\u2019s three-quarters of a trillion dollars. So it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d Goldman\u2019s promise not to finance new Arctic oil projects is just as important. For years, student activists have called on schools like Harvard and Yale to divest from fossil-fuel assets, just as universities divested from South African companies during apartheid. (Neither Ivy has yet to do so.) But experts have recognized that divestment from oil-company stocks is the blunt edge of the knife: What will really reshape the economy is divestment from bonds, or corporate debt. The bond market is less liquid and altogether more conservative than the public stock markets. (Just think: It\u2019s possible for you or I to buy a single share of Exxon stock using a smartphone app; buying an Exxon-issued bond is much more challenging.) As the Bloomberg columnist David Fickling has reported , the bond market for some fossil fuels is already drying up: Nearly 80 percent of support for new coal-power projects in Asia comes from governments or state banks. Now Goldman has also pulled its support for new coal. The bank has its own selfish reasons for this surge in climate spending. Among them: It is trying to move into consumer banking in the United States, and it is especially keen on capturing climate-concerned Millennials for its new online bank, Marcus . It wants to clean a corporate image that, 10 years after the financial crisis, remains tawdry to say the least. And it needs to recruit chipper young undergraduates (often from Harvard and Yale) to join its ranks\u2014and, generally, today\u2019s 20-somethings prefer to avoid complicity in the scorching of the sky. On top of all this, fossil-fuel stocks have systematically underperformed expectations this decade, and financiers are wary of those firms\u2019 business suffering further under future climate policy. But the bank\u2019s self-interested motivations suggest that it may actually follow through on its stated policy. And the American banks that finance even more fossil-fuel projects than Goldman Sachs\u2014 JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo lead the list \u2014share many of its concerns and vulnerabilities and, to some degree, touch even more consumers than Goldman does. That is good news for the planet, probably, but not necessarily for the people who live there. Instead of a planned and rapid transition to a post-carbon economy, the world is now on track for a disorderly and uneven one. Bankers are running a process that policy makers would handle with more care. \u201cFinance is now ahead of the politics,\u201d Allan said. \u201cAnd when finance is ahead of the politics, then we have a problem with the democratic and political control of the process.\u201d This state of affairs is especially dire for Americans, as our economy remains tied up in fossil-fuel wealth. So far, the federal government has avoided undertaking the kind of clean-energy industrial policy undertaken by China in this decade and by the European Union in the coming one. If President Donald Trump wins next year, it is unlikely the United States will pursue such a policy until at least 2025, by which time the global supply chain for all manner of green technology\u2014from batteries to electric cars\u2014will be essentially locked up. And what of international climate diplomacy? Funny enough, there is already a climate treaty well suited to the herky-jerky decarbonization now happening around the world. It\u2019s called the Paris Agreement. \u201cThe virtue of Paris is experimentalism and voluntarism,\u201d Allan told me. \u201cParis is an admission that we can\u2019t get the [UN] process ahead of the politics and economics of it. And the rapid progress on the politics and economics over the last 12 months shouldn\u2019t be washed out just because the COP didn\u2019t pan out.\u201d In other words, unlike the Kyoto Protocol\u2014which deployed exactly the kind of cross-border carbon rules that flummoxed this year\u2019s COP\u2014the Paris Agreement said countries should just start decarbonizing , and try to get better at it over time. Not every COP will be productive or even inspiring, but over time, as capital changes hands and technologies improve and the public demands it, the global economy will move away from carbon. Or at least that\u2019s the hypothesis. Next year\u2019s COP\u2014and next year\u2019s American election\u2014will continue to test it. And there are some experiments that climate advocates would prefer not to run.","headline":"Investment Bankers Are Now Waging the War on Coal","article_name":603760.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/goldman-sachs-fighting-climate-change-un\/603760\/","date_published":"2019-12-17 19:51:44","article_length":10630,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:09.761901","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/12\/goldman-sachs-fighting-climate-change-un\/603760\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Some Hurricane Ida survivors may have no choice but to leave. Sooner or later, people across the country will be in the same bind. When I met Flynn Hoob on Monday, he was standing in front of his home. Or rather, what was left of his home. It was the day after Hurricane Ida , and Hoob\u2019s one-story house in Bourg, Louisiana, had fallen off its concrete pilings and sunk halfway into the nearby bayou. He had ridden out the storm inside until his house had tipped over, at which point he fled to the flooded-out bar next door and waited out the storm there for eight hours. I asked Hoob about what happens now: Did he plan to relocate? Find a new house farther off the bayou, or maybe farther inland, where the hurricanes weren\u2019t as bad? \u201cNnnnnope,\u201d Hoob said. \u201cWe rebuild and we keep going; that\u2019s what we do. We love the bayou, man. We\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Ida has destroyed likely thousands of homes in Terrebonne Parish, the coastal area that includes Bourg. As I toured the area in the immediate aftermath of the storm, I saw damage that was hard to comprehend: Roofs had been ripped off, facades had been torn apart, and homes had been pushed off their pilings. The worst-damaged properties were the prefab trailers that house many low-income residents\u2014most of the trailers had been flipped over or smashed to rubble. Those who lived in these totaled properties were not around to answer my questions, because they didn\u2019t have homes that could be repaired, but everyone I met said the same thing: They planned to rebuild where they lived, and no one was considering moving someplace else. Read: We\u2019re hitting the limits of hurricane preparedness The urge to rebuild is common after major disasters, but for many people in Terrebonne Parish, hometown devotion may soon lose out to the cold, hard logic of economics. When a disaster leaves a community homeless, many of its members wind up moving rather than sticking around for the next calamity. These moves can take place across short distances, and sometimes they start out as semi-permanent relocations, but over time, they add up. Many Americans still think of \u201cclimate migration\u201d as a global phenomenon, one that would displace the residents of low-lying Bangladesh or scalding Yemen, but even before Ida hit, distinct migration patterns were taking shape in the United States too. In most cases, these moves are involuntary\u2014the product of economic displacement\u2014but climate change is now playing a role in voluntary movement as well: A recent study from Redfin found that about half of Americans who planned to move in the next year said natural disasters were a factor in their decision. Residents of towns like Bourg are dealing with a set of questions no one ever wants to have to ask themselves: Do I have to leave? Where do I go? They are facing these questions now, but sooner or later, all sorts of Americans will have to confront them\u2014even people in temperate cities such as New York, where hurricane remnants are flooding subway stations and seeping into houses. Leaving your home behind is terrible and tragic, but the brutality of climate change sometimes means it really is the only option. In Louisiana, climate migration started decades ago, as living on the state\u2019s coastline became more dangerous: The destruction of the marshland ecosystem that protected bayou towns from storm surge has made flooding much more common and much more severe. In towns such as Pointe-aux-Chenes and Dulac, where until recently the federal government had not completed large storm-surge levees, these floods forced many residents to move to higher ground. Thousands of residents have moved north and inland, migrating from the small towns of the lower bayou up toward cities such as Houma and the New Orleans suburbs. Read: A slow and quiet calamity This pattern of movement, which reached a crescendo after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, is so entrenched that the state more or less facilitates it. In 2016, when the Obama administration awarded Louisiana a $90 million climate-adaptation grant, the state spent almost half of it on a program called LA Safe, which allowed residents of various communities to design and fund their own climate-adaptation projects. In Lafourche Parish, residents chose to fund new affordable-housing units for climate movers heading to areas of the parish less prone to flooding. Meanwhile, in Plaquemines Parish, residents chose to fund a mental-health center that would help their neighbors cope with the gradual loss of their community. The northward migration in Louisiana is only going to become more common, says the Florida State University geographer Mathew Hauer. \u201cAreas that were declining before the storm are likely to decline after the storm,\u201d he told me. Hauer\u2019s projections show that as coastal areas even outside of Louisiana become more vulnerable, residents will move inland toward the closest midsize city, so that Gulf Coast residents may end up in cities such as Dallas while migrants from South Florida may end up in Orlando or Atlanta. But climate migration won\u2019t touch everyone equally: The first people to leave are younger and wealthier residents, Hauer said, which leaves behind an older generation of people who may lack the resources required to move away from the coast. That\u2019s exactly what already seems to be happening after Ida. The storm ripped apart 72-year-old Milton Thibodeaux\u2019s roof and caused water to leak into his house, but he told me he\u2019s not leaving. Thibodeaux resides in the town of Pointe-aux-Chenes, and he said he likes the privacy and tranquility of living down the bayou. There\u2019s another reason he\u2019s sticking around, though: He\u2019s close to retiring from his security job, and he\u2019s not sure where else he can afford to live. \u201cI got this house for about $100,000, but if I went to Houma, to the city, it might cost three times that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt my age, I don\u2019t know if I could start over again.\u201d Read: The American South will bear the worst of climate change\u2019s costs However, the tens of thousands of residents who evacuated the area have largely not yet returned to the homes they left behind. When they do come back, though, they will need a place to stay, and they may not be able to find one where they lived before. They may have no choice but to leave. Others who are fortunate enough to still have a home will take advantage of the disjuncture to relocate, perhaps to a bigger city or to a place farther away from the water. The destruction caused by Ida seems poised to supercharge the long-term process of inland movement, and with each future storm, the population of bayou towns like Bourg may continue to dwindle. For the rest of the country, Ida is a warning. As natural disasters grow more severe and more frequent, they will destroy more property, turning life in the U.S. into a massive game of migratory musical chairs.

{"id":null,"body":"What word might describe losing your home while staying in one place? From above, an open-cut coal mine looks like some geological aberration, a sort of man-made desert, a recent volcanic eruption, or a kind of terra forming. When the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht first gazed at a series of such mines while driving through his home region in southeast Australia, he stopped and got out of his car, overcome \u201cat the desolation of this once beautiful place,\u201d he wrote in his book, Earth Emotions . As a scholar, Albrecht was drawn to pondering language about and human relationships to the natural world. As a person, he also cared deeply for this place, which had been his home since 1982\u2014Australia\u2019s Hunter Region, a sublime area of dairy farms, wineries, and wallabies. The valley here offers a stopover along a flyway that runs from Alaska and Siberia all the way to New Zealand, and Albrecht\u2019s enthusiasm for bird conservation led him to understand how coal mining was threatening the well-being of the valley\u2019s feathered and human residents. From 1981 to 2012, the amount of land occupied by open-cut mines in the Hunter, akin to the mountaintop-removal mining that has devastated Appalachian landscapes, had increased almost twentyfold. The process leaves a permanent and raw scar, devoid of topsoil. Such mines can also discharge toxic metals into water supplies. Albrecht understood all of this in the abstract, but witnessing it directly was more visceral\u2014\u201can acute traumatic event of environmental destruction,\u201d he wrote, air \u201cthick with dust\u201d and the smell of coal, a \u201cdull roar\u201d from a mine detonation, a \u201ccloud of orange smoke.\u201d The coal industry, Albrecht felt, was wrecking his home. His observations marked the beginning of his relentless inquiry into what it means when the places we call home are remade or altered, sometimes violently. Over a period of decades, Albrecht has devoted himself to searching for language that might describe a type of sadness, shock, and loss that now seems more and more common\u2014grief of displacement, unease with our surroundings, a sense that damage and disaster might lie just down the road. He would feel the same rush of grief and concern in 2009 when he moved to the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia, where he had grown up. There, thanks partly to the early impacts of climate change, regional rainfall had dropped by about 15 to 20 percent since the 1970s, and the jarrah trees he had loved since he was a child\u2014eucalypts with lustrous wood\u2014were dying en masse. As he studied his own and others\u2019 emotional responses to such damages, he was on the cusp of something, a sentiment that now might easily define our time: We live in an era of radical change, when it feels like everything is being remade and altered. What do we call this unprecedented moment of home instability? In moments of collective distress, people have tried to name the pain that comes from the disruption of home: a complex set of feelings that includes longing, love, grief, existential angst, and even a lurking sense of dread. Loss of home can evoke the pain of dispossession, profound cultural and personal disorientation, and righteous anger, all of which can haunt a society for generations. After the English invaded Wales in the 1200s, the word hiraeth (pronounced \u201chere-eyeth\u201d) became a fixture in the Welsh language, in part to express the societal disruption of living under colonial rule . \u201cHiraeth is a protest,\u201d writes the essayist Pamela Petro. \u201cIt\u2019s a sickness [that comes on] because home isn\u2019t the place it should have been.\u201d In 1688, Johannes Hofer, then a medical student at the University of Basel in Switzerland, assembled a set of case studies to document the pain of home disruption. Hofer was born in southern Alsace two decades after the Thirty Years\u2019 War\u2014a conflict that turned the region into \u201ca smoldering land, amputated of half its population,\u201d writes the historian Thomas Dodman, and left this part of Europe in a state of economic stagnation and political instability. Later, Hofer\u2019s hometown became a sanctuary to refugees fleeing religious persecution in France. At the time, young Swiss mercenaries, hired out across Western Europe, reportedly suffered a common, chronic heartbreak , la maladie du pays , literally \u201cthe disease of the country\u201d in French, or Heimweh , \u201chome-woe\u201d in Swiss German. Hofer gave a scientific name to the pain of home loss that he had witnessed throughout his life. He called it nostalgia, derived from Greek, \u201ccomposed of two sounds, the one of which is Nosos [now more often spelled nostos ], return to the native land; the other, Algos , signifies suffering or grief,\u201d he wrote. To Hofer, nostalgia was also a medical condition whose symptoms included fever, nausea, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and respiratory problems, along with \u201cpalpitations of the heart, frequent sighs, also stupidity of the mind.\u201d Untreated, it could be fatal, and there were documented deaths among Swiss soldiers attributed to this malady. By the 19th century, the symptoms of nostalgia included \u201ctachycardia, skin rashes, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hearing difficulties, convulsions, heartburn, vomiting, diarrhea, and any rales or wheezing that a stethoscope might pick up in the chest,\u201d according to Dodman. We would probably now attribute many of these symptoms to other psychological ailments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Read: The West has never felt so small In the 20th century, the meaning of nostalgia became more detached from home; instead, it signified a longing for the real or imagined comforts of the past. But in discarding the original notion of nostalgia, we may have underestimated the impact that place and home have on the human body and our ability to navigate our lives. Having a home is part of human well-being; when home is disrupted, it can make us literally sick. It is a kind of trauma. The social psychiatrist Mindy Fullilove has described the pain felt by displaced communities\u2014especially Black communities uprooted because of gentrification, discrimination, and urban development\u2014as \u201croot shock,\u201d or \u201cthe traumatic stress reaction to the loss of some or all of one\u2019s emotional ecosystem.\u201d In an era of climate crisis, we will have to reckon with new complexities in our relationships to home, and even more people will experience the shock of being uprooted. In the long run, if we fail to address the crisis, hardly any safe refuge will be left. Like Hofer, Albrecht thought it would be useful to name the experience of watching one\u2019s home environment unravel. Around the turn of the millennium, he decided to coin his own word. (There are words in Indigenous languages that could have filled the gap, but none had yet migrated into the English language.) \u201cWith my wife Jill, I sat at the dining table at home and explored numerous possibilities. One word, \u2018nostalgia,\u2019 came to our attention as it was once a concept linked to \u2026 homesickness,\u201d he wrote. Hunter Region residents were homesick, but they hadn\u2019t gone anywhere\u2014the place they lived in just no longer offered the kind of comfort, solace, or safety one would expect from home. Albrecht came up with the word solastalgia , using the suffix - algia , meaning \u201cpain,\u201d and the same Latin root in the words solace , console , and desolation . In Latin, solacium means \u201ccomfort,\u201d and desolare , \u201cto leave alone,\u201d so the word solastalgia suggested the loss of comfort, the loneliness of being estranged from home. He published the first academic paper on the idea in 2005. Some neologisms never make it out of the realm of private conversation, and some molder in the corners of academic journals as useless jargon. But occasionally a word like this catches a bit of zeitgeist, like wind, and gets borne aloft into the culture at large. Over the next several years, Albrecht\u2019s mellifluous word seemed to tap into a kind of angst about life on a warming planet. A British trip-hop band produced an instrumental track called \u201cSolastalgia,\u201d and a Slovenian artist recorded an album also called Solastalgia . At the beginning of 2010, The New York Times Magazine ran a profile of Albrecht and commissioned the sculptor Kate MacDowell to create a porcelain representation of solastalgia\u2014a brain full of delicate trees and Australian wildlife. The neologism also offered a useful means of describing and studying how the impacts of climate change reach beyond tangible, physical, and economic damages. A team of social scientists identified feelings of solastalgia among people from rural northern Ghana, a region devastated by climate change\u2013related drought and crop failure. A collaboration of environmental scientists and public-health researchers observed solastalgia in communities affected by hurricanes and oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico. A Los Angeles physician named David Eisenman stumbled across the idea of solastalgia when interviewing survivors of the 2011 Wallow Fire, the largest wildfire on record in Arizona. Over and over, he heard them express \u201cthe sense that they were grieving [for the landscape] like for a loved one.\u201d He and his team found that the more uneasy they felt about the landscape itself, the more at risk they were for other kinds of psychological distress. Writers, artists, and scholars are now talking more openly about the emotions of the climate crisis. We have even more ways to name the experiences of people living through mega-disasters and the slow attrition of beloved places\u2014including climate grief , ecological grief , and environmental melancholia . In a 2020 survey by the American Psychological Association, more than two-thirds of American adults said they\u2019d experienced \u201ceco-anxiety.\u201d We are moving into an era defined by homesickness. Does it matter if we name or even notice this kind of angst? Recent years have made it abundantly clear how much our actual, physical homes and lives are at risk, all over the world. In 2019 alone, 24.9 million people around the globe were effectively evicted from their homes by natural disasters and climate-change impacts. Communities that survive disasters, both large and small, face damage that is hard to even tally. Various economists have tried to estimate the harm of climate change to our societies in monetary terms. Others have made calculations of potential economic losses based on factors such as wage-earning potential and gross domestic product. The world could lose up to 18 percent of GDP by 2050 if nothing is done about climate change. But such calculations strike me as profound underestimates of a phenomenon that could easily tear apart the basic fabric of our societies, economically and physically. In the past several years, a whole field of study has emerged to quantify the intangible losses associated with climate change. Losses related to culture, identity, heritage, emotional well-being, and the sacredness or spirituality of people\u2019s relationship to a place or a community\u2014not to mention experiences such as the joy, love, beauty, or inspiration found in a cherished landscape\u2014are nearly impossible to quantify in economic terms. So scholars of intangible loss are now trying to find other ways to account for them, formally, for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cWe have to find a better way to make visible what is often overlooked, ridiculed, dismissed as too personal, not generalizable, not quantifiable,\u201d says Petra Tschakert, who is a geography professor at Curtin University, in Australia, and who has also studied solastalgia in Ghana. Read: Why do we remember floods and forget droughts? Even these measures, though, do not quite capture what I have long wondered: Have we failed in some more personal realm? Have too many of us convinced ourselves for too long that climate change is the problem of others and that the storms will never rattle our own roof? And if we all faced our grief, would we find the collective will to take the kind of drastic action required to stanch the destruction? In 2013, I met Glenn Albrecht while I was on a writing fellowship in Perth, a city of Spanish-style architecture, white-sand beaches, brightly colored wild cockatoos, and some of the most profuse biodiversity of any city in the world. He had moved back to the country\u2019s west coast in 2009 to take a post as a professor of sustainability at Murdoch University and was living with and caring for his elderly mother in a house about 30 miles outside Perth that they had nicknamed Birdland. He had also broadened his work beyond solastalgia and was creating an entire lexicon of polysyllabic words related to climate change. At a seminar at a local university, I watched him\u2014a gangly, energetic man\u2014urge the few dozen people in the room to pronounce several other neologisms, waving his arms like a drum major as we sounded out in unison \u201cSUM-BI-OS-IT-Y,\u201d sumbiosity , which refers to a utopian-sounding state in which people live in balance with Earth. (I had doubts about whether this word would catch on, though I appreciated the sentiment.) Meanwhile, the idea of solastalgia has taken on a life of its own, and in the Hunter, the concept had been used in a 2013 court ruling to stop the expansion of a coal mine by the company Rio Tinto: The solastalgic pain of local residents was named as one of several reasons to halt the project. Albrecht had testified on the negative impacts on citizens and how the project would likely make one village unlivable. It was maybe the first time that something as intangible as love of home had nearly as much legal standing as pure economics. The decision was overturned again in 2015, but the community group there has continued to try to fight the mine. After Albrecht\u2019s mother died, he returned to southeastern Australia full-time in 2014\u2014to a place at the edge of the Hunter Region that he and his wife named Wallaby Farm, where they could live nearly off the grid with solar power and a farm full of fruits, herbs, and vegetables. But in 2019, wildfires raged around his property\u2014part of the massive outbreak of flames called the Black Summer that would devastate much of Australia and draw international attention. One fire ignited about a mile from Albrecht\u2019s house. Albrecht wore a face mask much of that season to cope with the searing smoke. He kept watch for any embers that might drift through the air and alight on his property. When I spoke with him not long thereafter, he said, \u201c We\u2019re actually in the process of trying to sell it and move. We\u2019re being driven out by climate change.\u201d (I later heard that he and his wife had stayed put.) In our interview\u2014just after the explosion of the coronavirus outbreak worldwide\u2014he took the same slightly detached, professorial tone that I had always heard from him. I couldn\u2019t hear his emotion in his voice. \u201cThe bushfires were a massive psychoterratic experience,\u201d he observed, drawing on another Latinate word he had coined. I asked him about a post he had placed on Facebook during the height of the fires. It was full of expletives and occupied some space between humor and rage. \u201cThe land that we love is being fried \u2026 because the joint is getting fucking hotter,\u201d he had proclaimed. This post was, he said, an expression of his anger in the Australian vernacular. When I read it, it was like hearing a battle cry in the distance\u2014a roar about everything we love, everything we are losing, everything we must try to defend.

{"id":null,"body":"Their ideology is unique in the free world With Democrats and President Barack Obama unable to pass any significant climate change legislation despite scientific consensus on the severity and immediacy of the threat, a number of political commentators are turning their attention to the widely held Republican position that climate change isn't real. Why, they ask, are U.S. conservative politicians nearly alone among the world's political players in their continued insistence that climate change is neither man-made nor a serious problem? Here's their conversation and what they say it means for the U.S., the world, and the effort to curb climate change. Part of the conservative creed has always been that markets, left to themselves, accomplish most tasks more efficiently than government regulation. That\u2019s true, of course, just as it\u2019s true that markets don\u2019t do everything you want. (That\u2019s why we have cheap deregulated airlines and yet retain the Federal Aviation Administration.) But conservatives have grown more insistent on the deification of markets in recent years; Rand Paul is ever less an outlier. If markets do damage, that\u2019s okay\u2014it\u2019s creative destruction \u00e0 la Schumpeter. But even if you accept that process absolutely within the economic sphere (and very few of us do, which is why Rand Paul just might lose), it doesn\u2019t follow that it works outside of it. Destruction of the planet\u2019s fundamental physical systems isn\u2019t creative\u2014it\u2019s just destruction. If Microsoft disappears, innovators will take its place. If Arctic ice disappears, no young John Galt is going to remake it in his garage. The essential question is: Is the environment a subset of the economy, or is it the other way around? Or, more combatively, you really think you can out-argue physics?

{"id":null,"body":"How I got co-opted into helping the rich prevail at the expense of everybody else F rom my parents\u2019 teenage years in the 1930s and \u201940s through my teenage years in the 1970s, American economic life became a lot more fair and democratic and secure than it had been when my grandparents were teenagers. But then all of a sudden, around 1980, that progress slowed, stopped, and in many ways reversed. I didn\u2019t really start understanding the nature and enormity of the change until the turn of this century, after the country had been fully transformed. One very cold morning just after Thanksgiving in 2006, I was on the way to Eppley Airfield in Omaha after my first visit to my hometown since both my parents had died, sharing a minivan jitney from a hotel with a couple of Central Casting airline pilots\u2014tall, fit white men around my age, one wearing a leather jacket. We chatted. To my surprise, even shock, both of them spent the entire trip sputtering and whining\u2014about being bait-and-switched when their employee-ownership shares of United Airlines had been evaporated by its recent bankruptcy, about the default of their pension plan, about their CEO\u2019s recent 40 percent pay raise, about the company to which they\u2019d devoted their entire careers but no longer trusted at all. In effect, about changing overnight from successful all-American middle-class professionals who\u2019d worked hard and played by the rules into disrespected, cheated, sputtering, whining chumps. Read: How companies actually decide what to pay CEOs When we got to the airport, I bought a newspaper at the little bookstore there that contains a kind of shrine to the local god Warren Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway. In it I read an article about that year\u2019s record-setting bonuses on Wall Street. The annual revenues of Goldman Sachs were greater than the annual economic output of two-thirds of the countries on Earth\u2014a treasure chest from which the firm was disbursing the equivalent of $69 million to its CEO and an average of $800,000 each to everybody else at the place. This was before the financial crash, before the Great Recession. The amazing real-estate bubble had not yet popped, and the economy was still apparently rocking. But it was becoming clear that an egregiously revised American social contract had been put in place, without much real debate. \u201cThis is not the America in which we grew up,\u201d I wrote in a magazine column at the time, by which I meant America of the several very prosperous decades after World War II, when the income share of the super-rich was not yet insanely high. Since the 1980s, the portion of income taken each year by the rich had become as hugely disproportionate as it had been in the 1920s, with CEOs paid several hundred times more than the average worker, whose average income had barely budged for decades. \u201cWe\u2019ve not only let economic uncertainty and unfairness grow to grotesque extremes,\u201d I wrote, but \u201calso inured ourselves to the spectacle.\u201d I also thought: Mea culpa . For those past two decades, I\u2019d prospered and thrived in the new political economy. And unharmed by automation or globalization or the new social contract, I\u2019d effectively ignored the fact that the majority of my fellow Americans weren\u2019t prospering or thriving. In 40 years, the share of wealth owned by our richest 1 percent has doubled, the collective net worth of the bottom half has dropped to almost zero, the median weekly pay for a full-time worker has increased by just 0.1 percent a year, only the incomes of the top 10 percent have grown in sync with the economy, and so on. Americans\u2019 boats stopped rising together; most of our boats stopped rising at all. Economic inequality has reverted to the levels of a century ago and earlier, and so has economic insecurity , while economic immobility is almost certainly worse than it\u2019s ever been. What\u2019s happened since the 1970s and \u201980s didn\u2019t just happen. It looks more like arson than a purely accidental fire, more like poisoning than a completely natural illness, more like a cheating of the many by the few\u2014and although I\u2019ve always been predisposed to disbelieve conspiracy theories, this amounts to a long-standing and well-executed conspiracy, not especially secret, by the leaders of the capitalist class, at the expense of everyone else. A Raw Deal replaced the New Deal. And I and my cohort of hippie-to-yuppie liberal Baby Boomers were complicit in that. At a dinner during my first visit to Washington, D.C., in June 1972\u2014on the very evening of the Watergate break-in, as it happened\u2014a mod young Department of Education bureaucrat informed me that the liberal political era in America was ending. To a 17-year-old fresh from Nebraska looking forward to wearing my McGovern for President button to a White House reception with Vice President Spiro Agnew the next day, this was a shocking revelation. The guy turned out to be right, of course. And that fall, when I started college, I saw firsthand that the youthquake and student movement and greening of America, everything I\u2019d spent the past few years getting stoked about, was palpably, rapidly ending. The Vietnam War was winding down and nobody was getting drafted, so fighting the Man started to seem like a pose. My senior thesis argued that more and more white-collar jobs, thanks in part to technology, were apt to become more and more proletarian, and it discussed whether workers in such professions might follow the lead of federal air traffic controllers, who had recently unionized. But I wasn\u2019t romantic or quite as enthusiastic about unions as liberals and Democrats used to be. In fact, the basic college-educated-liberal attitude toward unions was evolving from solidarity to indifference to suspicion, the result of a crack-up at that very moment of the old New Deal political coalition. The antiwar movement and counterculture, coming right after the successful civil-rights movement, had generated intense mutual contempt between the two main kinds of white Democrats, members of the working class and the expanding so-called New Class. The televised beatings by Chicago police of protesters outside the Democratic convention in 1968\u2014beatings encouraged by Mayor Richard Daley, the principal national white-working-class Democratic power broker\u2014was the most spectacular early episode in the crack-up, though there were others, most notably an organized attack in New York City by union construction workers on young antiwar protesters, in May 1970, that became known as the Hard Hat Riot. Plastic hard hats became a nationalist antiliberal symbol. Read: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy Beginning right then, the suspicion and contempt between less-educated white people and the liberal white bourgeoisie became what the American class struggle was most visibly and consciously about. And it would define our politics as the economy was reshaped to do better than ever for yuppies and worse and worse for the proles. During the 1960s, liberals had also started falling out of love with unions for reasons more directly related to political economics. It was a side effect of the long triumphalist liberal complacency, how Americans in general were taking for granted the progress and prosperity that the New Deal had helped make possible. Sure, an emerging liberal consensus had it, back in the day unions had been an essential countervailing force to the capitalists, but now\u2014having won 40-hour workweeks, good health care, good pensions, autoworker salaries of $75,000 (in 2020 dollars), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2014organized labor was victorious, powerful, the establishment. As a result, as the former machinist Irving Kristol wrote at the beginning of 1970, just before publicly moving full right, \u201ctrade unionism has become that most dangerous of social phenomena: a boring topic,\u201d and \u201cnone of the younger reporters is interested in spending so much time in the company of trade union officials.\u201d Another reason people like me found unions kind of boring was that a unionized job was almost by definition a boring job. When I started work as a writer at Time in 1981, I joined the union, the Newspaper Guild, but I understood that everything I cared about in that job\u2014good assignments, decent salary increases, titular honorifics\u2014would be entirely at my editors\u2019 discretion, not a function of collectively bargained rules. A union? Sure, fine. But I was talent . I was creative . I was an individual . College graduates tend to think of themselves that way, younger ones all the more, younger Baby Boomers at the time probably the most ever. And the intensified, all-encompassing individualism that blew up during the 1960s\u2014 I do my thing, and you do your thing\u2014 was not a mindset or temperament that necessarily reinforced feelings of solidarity with fellow workers or romantic feelings about unions. What happened with organized labor in journalism during the 1970s is an excellent illustration of those early days of the deepening fracture between upper-middle-class and lower-middle-class (white) Americans. It encompasses both the cultural split (yuppies versus yahoos) and the introduction of transformative technology in the workplace. Between the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 through the end of Watergate in 1974, The  Washington Post became a celebrated national institution, sexy liberalism incarnate. Following immediately on those two heroic achievements was another milestone episode, not very celebrated or heroic but likewise emblematic of the moment. In the spring of 1974, the journalists of the Post went out on strike\u2014bumblingly. They didn\u2019t even ask the paper\u2019s blue-collar unions to join them, they refused their own Newspaper Guild leaders\u2019 request to walk a picket line, the paper continued publishing, and after two weeks they gave up and accepted management\u2019s offer. Read: Organized labor's growing class divide It was a generation before websites and browsers, universal PCs and cell phones, 30 years before print dailies entered their death spiral, but technology was already changing newspapers in a big way, in the manufacturing part of the operation. Owners were eliminating typographers, who operated obsolete, elephantine Brazil -meets\u2013 Willy Wonka linotype machines that turned molten lead into blocks of type, and they also wanted to pay fewer people to operate the printing presses. A large majority of the Post \u2019s 2,000 employees were those blue-collar workers, a large majority of whom were suddenly redundant. In 1975 the 200 pressmen wouldn\u2019t come to terms and went on strike, and the other blue-collar unions at the Post went on strike in solidarity, as unions are supposed to do. Absolutely key to how it played out was the behavior of the Post \u2019s journalists. Just as the recent exposure of the secret Pentagon report on Vietnam and Nixon\u2019s crimes had been game-changing work by journalists with the essential support of management, the crushing of the strike and pressmen\u2019s union, also a game changer, was the work of management with the essential support of journalists. Two-thirds of the Post \u2019s unionized editorial employees didn\u2019t stop working at all, and a majority voted again and again against striking in solidarity with the pressmen. \u201cWhat I find ominous is that a number of Guild people don\u2019t think they have common cause with craftsmen,\u201d a Post journalist told a reporter at the time. \u201cThey feel professionally superior to guys with dirt under their fingernails.\u201d At a guild meeting, a Post reporter referred to the striking pressmen as \u201cslack-jawed cretins.\u201d Four weeks into the five-month strike, a Times article reported that \u201cif a Post Guild member is asked why he or she is not supporting the strike,\u201d many \u201csay they do not see themselves as ordinary working people. One said, \u2018We go to the same parties as management. We know Kissinger, too.\u2019\u201d And while probably none of the pressmen knew the secretary of state, their average pay was the equivalent of $111,000, about as much as reporters, which is the excuse one of the paper\u2019s reporters gave for crossing the picket line from day one. \u201cIf they got slave wages, I\u2019d be out on the line myself,\u201d said the 32-year-old Bob Woodward, co-author of the second-best-selling nonfiction book of the previous year. The strike ended just before the release of the film adaptation of All the President\u2019s Men , a fictionalization that only intensified the love of American liberals for The  Washington Post , even though the Post pressroom was about to become nonunion. As a Post columnist wrote back then in The New Republic , \u201cThe pressmen\u2019s strike was crushed with methods and with a severity that the press in general or the Post in particular would not be likely to regard as acceptable from the owners of steel mills. Yet because it was a newspaper management that broke the strike, no other newspaper has touched it properly, or even whimpered a protest.\u201d W hen I arrived at  Time as a writer five years later, I went out of my way to produce copy the modern way\u2014abandoning my office Selectric to use one of the special computer terminals crammed into a special little room, holed up with a few of the other young writers. That technology presently enabled the company to eliminate the jobs of the people downstairs who were employed to retype our stories. At the time I probably shrugged, like the newspaper reporters who hadn\u2019t cared much about the redundant linotype operators and pressmen. I think that if I had been one of those unionized craft workers who were abandoned by my unionized journalist colleagues 45 years ago, I would have watched journalists getting washed away and drowned by the latest wave of technology-induced creative destruction over the past 15 years with some schadenfreude. Margaret Sullivan: The Constitution doesn\u2019t work without local news What happened at newspapers (and magazines) back then also had disproportionate impact on this history of the right\u2019s hijacking of America\u2019s political economy, because once journalists were actively ambivalent about organized labor, that disenchantment spread more contagiously than if it had just been random young professionals bad-mouthing unions. News stories about labor now tended to be framed this way rather than that way or were not covered at all. Thus like most Democratic politicians at the same time, media people became enablers of the national change in perspective from left to right concerning economics. During the 1930s and \u201940s and \u201950s, the right had derided liberal writers and editors as Communists\u2019 \u201cuseful idiots,\u201d unwittingly doing the Communists\u2019 propaganda work; it looks in retrospect as if, starting in the 1970s, a lot of them\u2014of us\u2014became capitalists\u2019 useful idiots. A huge new cohort of college-educated liberal professionals got co-opted. My political coming of age coincided neatly with this process of assimilation. One afternoon in the summer of 1971, at age 16, I was among 100 or 150 people in Omaha\u2019s big central park watching Senator George McGovern deliver a speech. He was the most liberal, most antiwar candidate for the Democratic nomination. I remember nothing of what he said, because I was furtively inching toward and trying to overhear the two men standing near me: the 34-year-old actor Warren Beatty and McGovern\u2019s 34-year-old campaign director, Gary Hart, whom I also recognized because I was a politics geek and a McGovern volunteer. McGovern had led the Democratic Party commission that had just democratized the process of nominating presidential candidates, making it a matter of winning citizens\u2019 votes in primaries rather than delegates\u2019 votes at closed state party conventions. Which meant that from then on it was much harder for labor unions to influence the Democrats\u2019 choice of nominee\u2014which in turn enabled Hart to help win the 1972 nomination for the hippie-loving, antiwar, women\u2019s-lib, \u201cacid, amnesty, abortion\u201d candidate despised by so many of the blue-collar union members. Read: The gallant idealism of George McGovern Immediately after the 1972 wipeout, Hart launched his own political candidacy, for a U.S. Senate seat in Colorado. The Vietnam War and its cultural effects had made leaders and members of unions dislike McGovern, but as a child of the Depression and a former history professor, he had totally been on their side concerning the whole point of unions\u2014maximizing worker power versus corporate power. Hart, on the other hand, was a cool young Yalie whose 1974 Senate campaign stump speech was actually called \u201cThe End of the New Deal.\u201d He disparaged liberals who thought that \u201cif there is a problem, [you] create an agency and throw money at the problem,\u201d who \u201cclung to the Roosevelt model long after it ceased to relate to reality.\u201d In that first post-Watergate election, Hart beat the Republican incumbent by a landslide and became the very model of a modern major Democrat. I felt some affinity for this new, youthy, college-educated political wing\u2014as I felt at the time for postmodern architecture and New Wave music. I was in my 20s, so partly it was the sheer hubris of the young, rejecting the older generation because it was old. The slogan for Hart\u2019s Senate campaign, even though he was a decade older than the oldest Baby Boomer, was \u201cThey had their turn. Now it\u2019s our turn.\u201d But more than that, I actually, earnestly considered myself, as Hart put it, \u201ca new breed of thinker questioning old premises and disregarding old alliances.\u201d I wanted to be counterintuitive, contrarian, evidence based, ready to look at everything afresh. Like so many in my generation, I learned from the war in Vietnam and the war on drugs to mistrust the government, so maybe in other ways it had gotten bloated and inefficient, maybe nitpicky regulations were making it too hard to do business, maybe the antitrust approach invented in my great-grandparents\u2019 day was outmoded. And weren\u2019t labor unions retrograde and lumbering in lots of ways? And thus the new buzzword that spread like mad during the 1970s and \u201980s through art and culture, postmodernism , acquired a younger sibling in American politics\u2014 neoliberalism . Back then, at least in the United States, neoliberalism wasn\u2019t yet what it is in the 21st century, certain leftists\u2019 all-encompassing derogatory term for anything to the right of state-owned-everything socialism. Rather, it was a term proudly self-applied by a certain kind of U.S. political wonk. The notion, certainly among many writers and thinkers, if not necessarily the politicians, wasn\u2019t to pursue centrism or moderation for their own sakes, or political triangulation between left and right, but intellectual rigor and honesty. The new approach propagated rapidly. Soon almost every up-and-coming national Democratic politician was a New Democrat: Hart, Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown, Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Bob Kerrey, Bill Clinton\u2014all first elected senator or governor between 1974 and 1984 when they were in their 30s, all about to become serious presidential candidates. For two generations, liberals had been in control of the government and the news media and the culture, so it seemed as if that hegemony afforded them the luxury of true liberalism\u2014admitting mistakes, cutting some slack for the other side, trying new approaches. For 44 of the previous 48 years, Democrats had controlled both houses of Congress, and they had also held the presidency for most of that half century. All through the 1970s, when the GOP had only about a third of Senate seats, a third of that small Republican minority were bona fide liberals. Of course good-faith compromise and consensus between left and right were possible. Which helps explain why almost nobody foresaw fully the enormity of the sharp turn America was about to take. Nobody knew that we\u2019d continue heading in that direction for half a lifetime, that in the late 1970s big business and the well-to-do were at the start of a 40-year-plus political winning streak, economically, at the expense of everyone else. Liberals were ill-prepared to appreciate or cope with what was about to happen. The suddenly energized economic right was led by a confederacy of corporations and the rich as well as zealots who\u2019d been shut out of real power for decades. Modern liberals prided ourselves on entertaining all sorts of disparate policy ideas for improving the world, whereas the economic right really has one big, simple idea: Do everything possible and anything necessary to let the rich stay rich and get richer, and big business to stay big and powerful and get more so. Most liberals, like most Americans, preferred not to regard capitalists as categorically rapacious and amoral, or to imagine the U.S. political economy as a never-ending struggle in which everyone must ultimately choose between two sides. That seemed crude. They didn\u2019t vote for Reagan, but most didn\u2019t hate him, certainly not at first, because in their way they shared his dreamy faith in the 1940s Frank Capra movie vision of America. And to some degree, most liberals succumbed, like most Americans, to a new form of economic nostalgia that was being revived and popularized\u2014the notion that market forces are practically natural forces with which we dare not tinker or tamper too much. Finally, affluent liberals didn\u2019t want to think badly of all their nice friends and neighbors and classmates who happened to work at banks or in real-estate development or in the vicinity of C-suites. Starting in the 1970s, the Milton Friedman Doctrine, the righteous pursuit of maximum profit to the exclusion of absolutely everything else, freed and encouraged businesspeople and the rich to be rapacious and amoral without shame. Indeed, the new economic right even encouraged them to wage a class war\u2014explicitly against (traitorous white) liberal professionals and the (black) \u201cunderclass,\u201d more discreetly against the (white) working class they were enlisting as political allies. Such a colossal irony: After Socialists and Communists in the 1930s and then the New Left in the 1960s had tried and failed to achieve a radical class-based reordering of the American political economy, the economic right took its shot at doing that in the 1970s and \u201980s and succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s wildest hope or fear. Joseph Schumpeter was a brilliant economist at Harvard in the first half of the 20th century who celebrated entrepreneurs but also thought that capitalism as it existed would collapse and be replaced by some new social-democratic system\u2014not through workers\u2019 uprisings but by means of a subtle, nonviolent process. The \u201cperennial gale of creative destruction \u201d would drive this evolution of advanced economic systems, he wrote (without italics) in 1942, right after the Great Depression. \u201cThis process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.\u201d I feel sorry for Schumpeter, who died in 1950, because three decades after his death, with the rise of newfangled old-fashioned free-market mania, he got famous when that phrase was revived and reduced to a meme, repeated endlessly to explain and justify the sudden obsolescence of blue-collar production workers (and then the lesser white-collar workers). Creative destruction was popularized in a way Schumpeter hadn\u2019t meant it, as a celebratory sorry-suckers catchphrase for rootin\u2019-tootin\u2019 Wild West American capitalism as a permanent condition , where the rich and tough and lucky win and the losers lose hard. In the 1980s the term and its distorted meaning were enthusiastically embraced by the right and accepted with a shrug by college-educated liberals whose livelihoods didn\u2019t look likely to be creatively destroyed anytime soon by competition from computers or foreigners. We liberals had heard of Schumpeter, and we knew a bit about the industrial revolutions at the turns of the previous two centuries, and had learned in college to take it as a truism that painful transitions like these were just how history and economic progress inevitably unfolded, and that after a difficult patch\u2014for the actual, you know, workers , in what we started calling the Rust Belt\u2014things would sort themselves out. That long view, however, tended to omit the history that had made the previous industrial revolutions come out okay in America\u2014the countervailing forces that took a century to build, all the laws and rules and unions and other organizations created to protect citizens and workers and keep the system reasonably fair and balanced. And it was exactly this web of countervailing forces that, at exactly that moment, were being systematically dismantled by the right. By the 1980s, unions had been reduced to desperate parochial struggles to save jobs in declining heavy industries and, as mistrust of government grew, to unionizing more government employees. Moreover, the mainstream left offered no distinct, inspiring, politically plausible, national economic vision of a fairer future, as it had back in the 1930s and \u201940s. In response to economic Reaganism, liberals were committed to preserving the social-welfare status quo for old people and the (deserving) poor, and to convincing America that Democrats were now modern and pragmatic , not wasteful bleeding-heart suckers or childish protesters or comsymp fools. Very few believed anymore that a term FDR used in his 1944 Economic Bill of Rights, unreasonable profits , could even be a thing. Daniel Markovits: How McKinsey destroyed the middle class The faction that was now dominant in the Democratic Party had been pushing for a more centrist economic and social-welfare policy since the 1970s, but the Republican Party after 1980 had no comparable moderating faction\u2014which in a two-party system meant that Democrats kept moving toward a center that kept moving to the right. Like most people in my milieu, I always voted for Democrats, and I wasn\u2019t anti -union or anti -welfare or anti -government. The probability that elected Democrats would tend to increase my taxes wasn\u2019t a reason I voted for them, but my indifference to the financial hit felt virtuous, low-end noblesse oblige. However, even after the right got its way on the political economy around 1980, many people like me weren\u2019t viscerally skeptical of business or Wall Street either. Big businesses\u2014various media and entertainment companies\u2014paid me well and treated me fine, which probably didn\u2019t sharpen my skepticism toward a political economy that was being reordered to help big business (and people like me). When it came to the millions of losers, I felt grateful that my work couldn\u2019t be automated or offshored or outsourced, and I thought, Creative destruction, invisible hand, yada yada , and voted for politicians who said we should retrain steelworkers to become computer programmers. Although very few people I knew voted for Reagan, affluent college-educated people, liberals and otherwise, tended not to disagree ferociously about politics in the 1980s and \u201990s, and certainly not about economics. In retrospect, the rough consensus about economics looks like the beginning of an unspoken decades-long class solidarity among the bourgeoisie. Affluent college-educated people, Democrats as well as Republicans, began using the phrase socially liberal but fiscally conservative to describe their politics, which meant low taxes for higher-net-worth individuals (another new term) in return for tolerance of . . . whatever , as long as it didn\u2019t involve big new social programs that affluent people would have to pay for. It was a libertarianism lite that kept everything nice and clubbable and it did at least have the virtue of ideological consistency. When Gary Hart ran a second time for president, in 1988, one of his tax-policy advisers was Arthur Laffer, Reagan\u2019s inventor of supply-side economics. When Jerry Brown ran for the 1992 Democratic nomination, he too sought Laffer\u2019s help, to devise some kind of tax scheme \u201cthat was clear and easy to articulate,\u201d and Laffer himself says he voted for Bill Clinton. (He\u2019s now a Trump adviser.) The Democratic Leadership Council, co-founded by Clinton in 1985, became a think-tankish anchor for Democrats who didn\u2019t disagree with Republicans that pretty much the only acceptable new solutions to any social problem were market based. * For the remainder of the century, no candidate from the Democratic left became a plausible finalist for the nomination. In 1992, when Clinton won the nomination, his only serious competitors were two fellow New Democrats, Brown and Tsongas. Democrats had settled into their role as America\u2019s economically centrist party. There was no organized, viable national economic left in the vicinity of serious power. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Communism at the beginning of the 1990s was very good news, but it had the unfortunate effect of making almost any left critique of America\u2019s new hypercapitalism seem not just quixotic but also kind of corny and quaint. Not everybody in the 1990s was sanguine about the emerging future, or as oblivious as I still was to the multi-faceted unfairness that had been built into the economy, or as complacent as I was about the millions of Americans losing out in the go-go globalizing digitizing frenzy. Around this time, a middle-aged law-school professor and bankruptcy expert, until recently a registered Republican who\u2019d been affiliated in the late 1970s with the conservatives\u2019 hugely influential new Law and Economics movement, began to see the light. Elizabeth Warren has said that she realized only in the \u201990s that \u201cstarting in the \u201980s, the cops were taken off the beat\u201d in financial services. \u201cI was with the GOP for a while,\u201d she has said, \u201cbecause I really thought that it was a party that was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets. I feel like the GOP just left that. They moved to a party that said, No, it\u2019s not about a level playing field . And they really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle-class American families.\u201d Read: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s definition of capitalism I\u2019m betting that at the end of 1999, Warren didn\u2019t feel complete solidarity with all the thousands of demonstrators in Seattle outside the biannual World Trade Organization meeting. Their grievances were various\u2014from AFL-CIO folks pissed off about U.S. companies manufacturing more and more things overseas to anarchists smashing store windows and otherwise acting out their hatred for the System. I know I rolled my eyes at the Gen-X kids in Seattle chaining themselves together and getting off on tear gas; at their lack of a feasible agenda or nuance or even coherence; and at the belief of so many of them in a shadowy, multi-tentacled conspiracy of the omnipotent elite to tyrannize the little people and subvert democracy. It took me a few more years to realize that their caricature of the new economic paradigm was closer to right than wrong. What that new paradigm ultimately brought us, of course, is Donald Trump. Back in the early \u201970s, when the band of intellectuals and CEOs and politicians and the rich began pursuing their dream of hijacking the U.S. political economy and dragging it back in time to the days before the New Deal, surely none of them imagined they\u2019d wind up here . Neither with the scale and durability of their victory, nor with such a front man\u2014so brazenly racist and xenophobic and misogynistic and proto-fascist, a businessman so completely incompetent as an executive. Over the decades, however, as they decided again and again that their ends (money, supremacy) always justified any and all means (stoking hatred, spreading falsehoods, rousing their rabble while also rigging the system against them), it was bound to end somewhere in this horrid vicinity. In 2016, as the current generation of Fausts made their darkest bargain yet, surely some of them smelled a whiff of sulfur or heard a demonic cackle as they signed away whatever remained of their souls. The obeisance of the rich right and their consiglieri to Trump for the past four years has exposed more nakedly than ever their compact\u2014everything about money, anything for money\u2014and the events of 2020 pushed that along to an even more hideous crescendo. In early spring, when COVID-19 had killed only dozens of Americans, Stuart Stevens, a strategist for the four previous Republican presidential nominees, wrote that \u201cthose of us in the Republican Party built this moment,\u201d because \u201cthe failures of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis can be traced directly to some of the toxic fantasies now dear to the Republican Party \u2026 Government is bad. Establishment experts are overrated or just plain wrong. Science is suspect .\u201d Norm Ornstein: I\u2019ve witnessed the decline of the Republican Party Entirely apart from this administration\u2019s unique incompetence and Orwellian denial of facts, while its handling of the pandemic may wind up as a political failure for them, every piece of the crises\u2019 exacerbation came directly out of the right\u2019s playbook of the past four decades. Stevens could have also listed Believe in our perfect mythical yesteryear , Short-term profits are everything , Inequality\u2019s not so bad , Liberty equals selfishness , and Entitled to our own facts. Government is bad . A Republican administration uniquely unsuited and unready and unwilling to deal promptly and effectively with such a national crisis? Decades before this latest show-business president defamed his entire executive branch as a subversive \u201cdeep state,\u201d the co-creator of late Republicanism announced in 1981, a few minutes after becoming the first show-business president, that \u201cin this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem,\u201d and then made a shtick out of warning Americans to consider any offers of help from the government \u201cterrifying.\u201d Believe in our perfect mythical yesteryear. The right twisted and exploited nostalgia in the 1970s and \u201980s to get its way, selling people on a restoration of old-time America with storybook depictions that omitted all the terrible parts of the past\u2014including the epidemics before we had a U.S. public-health system and before government-funded vaccines that governments required citizens to get, the economic panics and collapses before governments intervened to help unemployed workers, the phony miracle cures marketed by huckster showmen before government put a stop to that. Establishment experts are wrong, science is suspect . Since the 1980s, the oil and gas and coal industries have conspired with the right to encourage Americans to disbelieve the climate-science consensus, because that science created pressure to mitigate a global crisis with government interventions that could reduce those businesses\u2019 profits. From the start in 2020, the reckless right, the president in the lead, encouraged Americans to disbelieve virologists and epidemiologists and other experts in order to achieve their overriding goals of keeping stock prices and corporate profits up. Entitled to our own facts. That systematic spread of coronavirus misinformation by Trump and the right couldn\u2019t have happened without the creation in the 1980s (Rush Limbaugh) and \u201990s (Fox News) of big-time right-wing mass media. Their continuous erasure for two generations of distinctions between fact and opinion and truth and fiction have always served the propaganda purposes of the political party most devoted to serving the interests of big corporations, and during the COVID crises\u2014 Reopen Now \u2014tried to serve those business interests directly. Short-term profits are everything. Years of reckless greed by Wall Street and financial operators dragging healthy companies into leveraged buyouts, and piling on so much debt they become weak, rendered them barely able to survive in normal times. Excessive corporate debt turns out to be a main underlying condition comorbid with the economic effects of the pandemic. Liberty equals selfishness . After the right spent decades forging a tantrum-based politics focused on sensible rules that reduce unnecessary deaths and sickness\u2014No gun control! No mandatory vaccinations! No universal health insurance!\u2014 of course mobs of childish adults in the spring and summer of 2020 were excited to throw self-righteous tantrums on TV about the mean grown-ups grounding them and telling them to wear stupid masks. While also playing soldier by carrying semiautomatic rifles in public. Inequality\u2019s not so bad . The glaring new light of the pandemic showed what we\u2019ve become\u2014the health risks and the economic burdens borne disproportionately by people already near the financial edge, Black people, and people with low-paying jobs that can\u2019t be done from home. Countries with better social contracts and more effective national governments promptly put strict pandemic protocols in place and have COVID death rates running at a third, a quarter, or just 2 percent of America\u2019s. They also straightforwardly and immediately addressed the massive economic consequences, without much political rancor, because providing good social-safety nets to try to protect everyone from economic disaster is simply what governments do . Before this fresh hell, our political economy and society were already at an inflection point, Americans stuck uncomfortably and often dysfunctionally on the cusp between searching for lost times and imagining a better future. We have now arrived at a scarier place. But it\u2019s not exactly unprecedented. We\u2019ve been here before. We were in a place like this when my grandparents were young, in the 1910s. There was the global influenza epidemic, of course, which killed one in 150 people in the United States, the equivalent of 2 million Americans now. But in many other ways, those early 1900s look remarkably like the early 2000s. Read: How the pandemic defeated America Corporate mergers and consolidation had accelerated and political corruption by the rich and powerful had become extreme at the end of the 19th century. A Wall Street crash occurred in 1907. Americans experienced an extraordinary period of technological change\u2014electrification, telephones, movies, airplanes, and cars, all at once. The foreign-born population of the United States reached 15 percent, up from 5 percent just a half century earlier. The influx of non-Protestant foreigners and the mass migration into U.S. cities of Black people, accompanied by skillful racist fictions in a riveting new medium ( The Birth of a Nation ), prompted a revival of the Ku Klux Klan. Political engagement was high: The big turnout in the midterm elections of 1914 wasn\u2019t exceeded until \u2026 2018. Back then as now, anarchism was bubbling up on the right as well as the left in America, along with a general \u201csense of conspiracy and secret scheming,\u201d as the young political journalist Walter Lippmann put it in 1914. Lippmann noted the rise of nostalgic anti-modern anger and its political embodiment by the populist Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan, who\u2019d just been a presidential nominee for the third time. Twenty years after that, in the 1930s, when my parents were young, we were also in a place not unlike the one we\u2019re in today. The Depression revealed the precariousness and unnecessary unfairness of our economy, then prompted a great political paradigm shift and the creation of fundamental changes that redeemed American capitalism by making it new and improved and more sustainable. And we were in a place a little bit like this when I was young, in the 1970s. Crazy inflation and various disconcerting large events\u2014the oil-price crisis, Watergate, the defeat in Vietnam, the collapse of iconic U.S. manufacturing\u2014combined to create high anxiety of which the economic right took brilliant political advantage. Today\u2019s economic right was instantly determined to exploit the pandemic crises to maintain and increase their political and economic power, and thus the share of American wealth that flows to big business and the rich. So, too, must the economic left try to use the crisis to increase its political power and thereby begin to restore the democratic sharing of economic power and wealth we had as recently as the 1970s, and improve on it. And Americans at large need to rediscover the defining but atrophied national knack for taking up the challenges of the new in new ways. We can already see how the pandemic will change the economy, the culture, and daily life temporarily. We will continue adapting and adjusting. But the permanent changes? For one thing, I\u2019m betting that a jobless super-automated future will arrive even sooner than experts have been predicting. In just the past few months many of us have become habituated to working only from home by communicating only with little talking pictures of human colleagues. That\u2019s why this week, when the overall Dow Jones stock-market average was back up 43 percent from its early-pandemic low, the Big Tech stocks were doing fantastically well\u2014Netflix up 68 percent, Facebook up 75 percent, Amazon up 87 percent, Apple up 95 percent. Websites and AI and robots don\u2019t get sick or sicken people or worry about getting sick. But we really don\u2019t know where the national experience of the pandemic will lead us\u2014the overnight upending, the long trauma, judging how individuals and institutions and systems worked or failed. People in 1918 and 1929 and 1970 (and 1347, as the Black Plague began) had no clue what was coming next, either. Will my hypothetical grandchildren grow up as ignorant of the current events as I was of the global viral pandemic my grandparents survived? For Americans now, will surviving a year (or more) of radical uncertainty help persuade a majority to make the necessary radical changes in our political economy to reduce Americans\u2019 unnecessary chronic uncertainty and insecurity? Like Europe after the plague 600 years ago, will we see some fantastic flowering of new creative works and the emergence of a new economic system? Or will Americans remain hunkered forever\u2014as confused and anxious and paralyzed as we were before 2020\u2014descend into digital feudalism, and retreat back into our cocoons of nostalgia and cultural stasis, providing the illusion that nothing much is changing or ever can change? The United States used to be called the New World. It\u2019s a new world again, maybe the way it was becoming new in the 1910s. Lippmann was pragmatic, in many ways conservative, in no way a utopian, but back at that chaotic, pivotal moment he quoted Oscar Wilde\u2019s line that \u201ca map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at,\u201d because social progress only comes by navigating toward hopeful visions of perfection. \u201cOur business is not to lay aside the dream,\u201d Lippman explained, \u201cbut to make it plausible.

{"id":null,"body":"After my recent column on how big business is coming together to defend global warming legislation \u00a0in California, I was overwhelmed by the number of notes I received asking about the state of the global warming debate. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is in shambles, the U.S. Senate is stymied, and the public is losing confidence that climate change is real. But this past summer's crazy weather may be changing some minds. With summer 2010 now in our rear-view mirror, it's worth considering: Did global warming cause the once-in-a-lifetime weather events? New Yorkers dealt with a sweltering heatwave and were unsurprised to learn that the period from June to August shattered previous temperature records. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that we've just lived through the hottest decade on record. And after this summer, with many countries, including Russia to Saudi Arabia, setting their all-time heat records, people all around the planet are asking whether carbon dioxide emissions could be to blame. Here's a quick roundup of extreme weather events this summer: Forest Fires in Russia This summer was the hottest on record for Russia, and the resulting wildfires plagued the country with smoky skies . More than a thousand people were killed and 300,000 acres were burned. The fires destroyed a naval base, and there were widespread fears that the radiation-contaminated area surrounding Chernobyl would be ignited. President Vladimir Putin, after a slow initial reaction, stepped into high gear, with state media filming him co-piloting a fire plane. Putin declared global warming a threat to Russia, a remarkable statement from a leader whose country's economy is based on carbon dioxide intensive fossil fuels. Pakistan Pakistan set the record this summer for the hottest temperature in Asia when it reached 129 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, floods ravaged Pakistan, with some estimates reaching as high as one-fifth of the country inundated by floodwaters and more than 1,500 people killed. Coral Bleaching The New York Times recently featured a story suggesting that the warmer-than-usual oceans might cause a repeat of the 1998 coral bleaching event, when 16 percent of the world's shallow-water reefs died. The period from January to August of this year matched the temperatures for the same period in 1998, the hottest year in the historical record. Reefs are sensitive to heat changes and shed their color, as if they were bleached white, in a last-ditch effort to survive. Walruses At Point Lay in Alaska, thousands of walruses are pulling themselves out of the water as the sea ice they depend on for foraging has disappeared. Estimates are that 10,000-20,000 walruses are hauling themselves out right now along the Chukchi coastline.","headline":"Summer's Officially Over: What Did It Show Us About Climate Change?","article_name":63391.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2010\/09\/summers-officially-over-what-did-it-show-us-about-climate-change\/63391\/","date_published":"2010-09-22 20:00:00","article_length":2807,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:11.760760","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2010\/09\/summers-officially-over-what-did-it-show-us-about-climate-change\/63391\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Stopping global warming might be a hopeless cause, but that doesn't mean we can't find creative solutions to live with it.\u00a0 This week the National Climate Data Center confirmed what most had long believed: 2012 was the warmest year on record for the United States. Ever. And not just a bit warmer: a full Fahrenheit degree warmer than in 1998, the previous high. In the land of climatology statistics, that is immense. In the understatement of one climate scientist, these findings are \"a big deal.\" Almost every news story reporting on this juxtaposed the record with a series of disruptive climate events, ranging from the drought that covered much of the United States farmland and punctuated by Hurricane Sandy in its tens of billions of dollars of devastation. Many also pointed out that eight of the 10 warmest years have occurred since 1990 (though it should be noted that official records only extend to 1895). Not surprisingly, these observations were almost always followed by warnings of more warming and substantially worse consequences to come. But what if climate change isn't the disaster we fear but instead one more obstacle that humans can meet, one that may spur innovation and creativity as well as demand ever more resilience? What if it ultimately improves life as we know it? That the planet is getting warmer there should be no doubt. Nor should there be much question about the role of human development, industrialization and carbon emissions as a causal factor. Of course, many do still question these changes, or at least to what degree they have been triggered by human activity, and yes, there have been wide climate swings throughout the millennia. Still, the preponderance of current scientific knowledge maintains that warming is accelerating and that fossil fuels and various effluvia of modern industry are a cause. It does not, however, follow that the future arc of these changes is disastrous. Unwanted, unwelcome and uneasy? For sure. Potentially lethal? Yes. But so much of the debate over the past 30 years has been over what is causing climate change, and how to prevent more change from happening, that comparatively less energy has been spent on adapting to it. In part, those most focused on these issues, from Green parties in Europe to environmentalists in the United States, have often believed that any discussion of mitigating the effects of climate change is tantamount to giving up on preventing it. That has led to a jeremiad mentality, epitomized by Al Gore and the scathing warnings of what lies ahead in his hugely influential 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth. The advantage of that approach was that it alerted many to the dangers of climate change; the disadvantage was that it scared people into passivity and closed fruitful avenues to policies focused on mitigating the effects rather than halting the trend. And while halting the trend might have been feasible (just) 20 years ago, the most we can achieve now is to reduce the rate and intensity of climate change until the world's population levels off sometime in the middle of the 21st century. Activists can and should still focus on reducing global emissions, but not at the expense of answering how we will live with the change. Perhaps in recognition of the need of a new paradigm, \"resilience\" has quietly become a buzzword. The ever provocative Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his recent book Antifragile argues that only organizations capable of meeting crises can survive crises. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, counties and cities in the Northeast have been contemplating how best to prepare for future weather shocks. That has led to renewed appreciation for cities, such as Rotterdam, that have long undertaken environmental planning organized around the notion that floods will happen no matter what humans do. The challenge isn't to find a way to prevent floods; it's to find a way to live with them. The two approaches could not be more distinct: One warns of catastrophe and attempts to steer away from it. One pragmatically accepts that some undesirable things will happen no matter what. Rotterdam has thus focused both on preventing as much flooding as possible (floodgates) and on urban infrastructure that is as flood-resistant as possible: power grids that have dispersed nodes, waterproof insulation, even floating parts of the city in case of truly severe inundation. Far from signaling a resignation to climate change, resilience, adaption and mitigation all shift energy away from holding back the tide and toward innovation and creativity in meeting it. In fact, those are precisely what have fueled whatever positive development there has been in human history (and admittedly, some negative as well). The theoretical physicist David Deutsch points out that pessimism about future trends is actually more \"blindly optimistic\" than genuine optimism because it assumes that we can know the future. But as has been all too evident recently, we cannot. Instead, the only source of progress has been the ability of humans to learn and adapt. While climate change could spell death and harm to low-lying areas around the world as the seas rise, life 30,000 years ago was hardly hospitable. Yet people managed to create viable living conditions anyway. Necessity demanded it, and our ability to create and innovate made it possible. That approach is imperative not just for climate change but for multiple areas that generate such anxiety about the future. The imbalance of the financial system? Those are only made worse by the false belief that a system could be created where such risks don't exist; better to find ways to mitigate the risks of a global interconnected financial system than seek, Don Quixote-like, ways to eliminate risk. The dysfunction of Washington? Better to find ways to meet collective needs that don't depend on the federal government (or any large central bureaucracy) than pile all those needs onto one large, unwieldy and cumbersome institution and hope for the best. Our response to climate change is only one way that we have chosen the path of pessimism instead of a path of innovation. How we meet this challenge will say much about how we meet all of our challenges.

{"id":null,"body":"Extreme weather and energy uncertainty are already sending prices soaring. The McMansions of the mid-2000s might be the most American form of housing, but they were not, in general, grown in America. Although the United States is home to more than 200 billion trees, the type of lumber harvested from North Carolina to Mississippi warps and twists when used as a vertical stud. Eventually it will pop your drywall. So for our home-framing needs, Americans rely on northern spruce and fir felled up north, milled into lumber, purchased by men like Stinson Dean, a Colorado-based lumber trader, and placed onto railcars bound for Dallas, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. In that last boom, Dean remembers, the U.S. built 2 million homes a year, and lumber prices never got much above $450 per 1,000 board feet, within the tidy range they\u2019d stuck to since he entered the business nearly a decade ago. Now, the U.S. can\u2019t find enough lumber to complete more than 1.3 million homes a year. Meanwhile, lumber is back up to $1,200. \u201cThe price of lumber has tripled, but we\u2019re producing 40 percent less homes,\u201d Dean told me. There has not been a bigger gap, in fact, between the number of homes that builders are starting  and the number that they\u2019re finishing in decades . Since the mid-aughts boom, the North American economy actually lost productive capacity. Dean has little doubt about what is to blame. \u201cThe lumber-price story is a climate story,\u201d he said. If a series of climate-change-aggravated disasters\u2014including a multiyear outbreak of bark-eating beetles, back-to-back record-breaking fire seasons, and a massive November flood that washed out rail lines\u2014had not struck British Columbia, \u201csawmills would be able to treat this market just like they did in 2006,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price would never get over $500.\u201d \u201cThere are people who say, \u2018Climate change isn\u2019t affecting me,\u2019\u201d Janice Cooke, a forest-industry veteran at the University of Alberta, told me last year. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to go to the hardware store and say, \u2018Holy cow, the price of lumber has gone up.\u2019\u201d Taken by itself, climate change\u2019s role in driving lumber inflation would be a fluke. But worrying signs have started to appear that these dynamics are not limited to lumber. Both climate change itself and the inevitable policy response to it\u2014the global energy transition to low-carbon fuels\u2014are starting to drive up prices around the world. And the world may not have the right tools to deal with it. Over the past year, U.S. consumer prices have risen 7 percent, their fastest rate in nearly four decades, frustrating households and tanking President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating. And no wonder. High inflation corrodes the basic machinery of the economy, unsettling consumers, troubling companies, and preventing everyone from making sturdy plans for the future. Given all that, you would think economists have a good, detailed sense of why  it happens . But the profession\u2019s \u201cdirty little secret,\u201d according to Seth Carpenter , the chief global economist for Morgan Stanley, is that they cannot predict it with ease. Economists understand that inflation arises from an imbalance of supply and demand at the absolute highest level of the economy. They even have a pithy phrase about it: Inflation is caused by \u201ctoo many dollars chasing too few goods.\u201d The fault almost always lies with the dollars. To better understand this, think of a fairy-tale kingdom where the royal alchemist succeeded in turning lead into gold, and the delighted king ordered the royal mint to smelt more coins with it. Then he tossed the coins out the window to the populace, begging them to love him. Assuming nothing else changed about the kingdom, the king\u2019s would-be generosity would cause prices to surge. Now, Biden is not a king, nor does he have an alchemist on staff. But some economists believe that he accidentally did something similar last year when he passed a $1.9 trillion relief bill into an economy still constrained by the pandemic. Flush with $1,400 stimulus checks but stuck at home, consumer spending on durable goods surged. But where was all that stuff supposed to come from? America\u2019s overeager excess of dollars leapt into the world, chasing goods from factories shut down by the Delta variant and ports clogged with shipping containers. But it also went chasing after \u2026 scarce lumber from Canadian forests. Some of the biggest causes of today\u2019s inflation do not seem related to the sudden surfeit of dollars. The surge in dollars can\u2019t explain why gas prices are so high or why coffee prices are spiking. Something else is going on. For years, scientists and economists have warned that climate change could cause massive shortages of major commodities, such as wine , chocolate , and cereals . Financial regulators have cautioned against a \u201cdisorderly transition,\u201d in which the world commits only haphazardly to leaving fossil fuels, so it does not invest enough in their zero-carbon replacements. In an economy as prosperous and powerful as America\u2019s, those problems are likely to show up\u2014at least at first\u2014not as empty grocery shelves or bankrupt gas stations but as price increases. That phenomenon, long hypothesized, may be starting to actually arrive. Over the past year, unprecedented weather disasters have caused the price of key commodities to spike, and a volatile oil-and-gas market has allowed Russia and Saudi Arabia to exert geopolitical force . \u201cThis climate-change risk to the supply chain\u2014it\u2019s actually real. It is happening now,\u201d Mohamed Kande, the U.S. and global advisory leader at the accounting firm PwC, told me. Want to see what climate change is already doing to prices? Look to the prairie. Last year, the United States suffered through its hottest summer ever measured, finally breaking the record set during the Dust Bowl summer of 1936. In the northern Great Plains, searing heat\u2014combined with record-setting drought\u2014 gave rise to swarms of grasshoppers that devoured the wheat crop. Those conditions helped push wheat prices to their highest level in years. Corn prices also rose 45 percent last year. Or look to Brazil, which sagged under its worst drought in 91 years early last year. Water levels in the Paran\u00e1 River, a major shipping artery, fell so low that cargo traffic was disrupted. Then in July, a surprise frost struck Brazil\u2019s coffee belt , lacerating already drought-weakened arabica  trees. Brazil produces nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s coffee. The cold snap damaged two years of crops at once, burning so deep into the trees that it fringed the buds that will become next year\u2019s flowers. Coffee prices leapt on the news; today coffee is as expensive as it\u2019s been in 10 years and double its 2020 levels . The companies behind Nescaf\u00e9, Folgers, and Caf\u00e9 Bustelo plan to raise consumer prices in response . In Canada, the worst single-year drought since 1961  doubled pea prices, sending them to an all-time high . France\u2019s water-logged and record-breakingly hot summer also helped push up global pea prices. (Alternative-meat products have made peas more in demand than ever.) In Germany and Belgium, days of torrential flooding killed more than 200 people and severely damaged the potato crop, contributing to last year\u2019s price increase of 180 percent . (Climate change helped make the rainfall that caused those floods more likely, according to the World Weather Attribution initiative .) Climate-addled droughts even affected the high-tech sector, Kande, the PwC advisory leader, said. More than half of the world\u2019s semiconductors are made in Taiwan , most of them at a sprawling factory owned by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC, which uses 37 million gallons of water a day, faced production uncertainty last spring when Taiwan experienced its largest drought in half a century and began rationing water. That said, even when bad weather destroys a crop, it doesn\u2019t always lead to inflation. Russia, the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, produced 9 million fewer metric tons of wheat last year than it did in 2020. But Russian wheat prices fell because the country couldn\u2019t sell enough wheat to sustain them. And even though the drought in the United States sent cattle prices crashing as ranchers culled their herds, meat prices surged. Meat-processing companies passed none of the spread along to consumers. Given all this, you can see why Wall Street and corporate executives are more concerned about climate change than ever. But it\u2019s not just commodity prices that are up. The economy shows evidence of a new, more inflationary regime caused not only by climate change but by the fight over how to respond to it. And as the world has begun to transition\u2014slowly, incompletely\u2014away from fossil fuels, it has created imbalances in the energy system. The first mismatch is between fossil-fuel supply and demand. According to International Energy Agency data, the world has dramatically reduced its investment in oil and gas production over the past few years. This hasn\u2019t happened only because of climate change: Yes, investors are skittish about long-term fossil-fuel demand in a decarbonizing world, but they\u2019re also angry that oil stocks have performed so pitifully over the past decade. Yet the world has not reduced its appetite for oil. It has continued to invest in cars, trucks, planes, ships, and plastic-dependent factories at a voracious rate, according to the IEA. Nor is it investing in zero-carbon energy fast enough to pick up the slack from declining oil investment. In 2021, the world put only $755 billion into the energy transition. By any historical measure, that was a bonanza amount\u2014but it must more than quadruple ,  to $4 trillion, in the next decade for the world to avoid more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming while meeting its energy needs, the IEA says. These mismatches have allowed oil producers to remind the rest of the economy of their power. Oil prices, now at their highest level since 2014, have made up 27 percent of the \u201cexcess\u201d inflation since the pandemic began, according to the financial journalist Matthew C. Klein . Yet despite widespread Democratic agreement over its terms, Congress has not yet passed President Joe Biden\u2019s climate and energy package, which could start to relieve this mess. If the mismatch between producers and consumers continues, higher oil prices\u2014and higher prices for energy in general\u2014could stick around for a long time. That would be bad for prices. Although economists disagree over the role that fossil fuel plays in creating inflation, there\u2019s little doubt that high oil prices trickle down to higher costs in the rest of the economy. When oil and gas prices rise, farmers need to spend more to tend their fields (because diesel prices go up), and to fertilize their crops (because synthetic fertilizer is made with natural gas), and to get their goods to market (because the packaging is made of plastic). The only way to break that cycle of cost increases is to move away from fossil fuels. But oil producers have demonstrated that they will get a veto over that transition as well. How to respond to these problems? The U.S. government has one tool to slow down the great chase of inflation: Leash up its dollars. By raising the rate at which the federal government lends money to banks, the Federal Reserve makes it more expensive for businesses or consumers to take out loans themselves. This brings demand in the economy more in line with supply. It is like the king in our thought experiment deciding to buy back some of his gold coins. But wait\u2014is it always appropriate to focus on dollars? What if the problem was caused by too few goods? Worse, what if the economy lost the ability to produce goods over time, throwing off the dollars-to-goods ratio? Then what was once an adequate number of dollars will, through no fault of its own, become too many . Imagine, now, that the kingdom\u2019s outlying farms were destroyed by a dragon: The price of food would increase inside the castle walls, but it would be the dragon\u2019s fault, not the royal mint\u2019s. And the solution would be neither to raise taxes nor to slow the minting of coins from the king\u2019s mines. In fact, if the king tried to claw back coins, then he could prolong the crisis: The townspeople would still use their meager earnings to bid up the price of food, but they would have less money to do it with, so everyone would be poorer and hungry. The king would instead need to import more grain, or ration out supplies, or plant more farms (hopefully in dragon-proof regions). Though it might sound silly, the modern global economy is closer to that fabled realm than we might think: Yes, container ships and jumbo jets connect far-flung farms and factories to consumers, which has permitted a planetary smoothing out  of prices. But ultimately globalization has stretched the castle walls as far as they can go, and the realm remains dependent on certain key and vulnerable places. A single woodland province furnishes timber for most American homes; a single highland country grows nearly half of the world\u2019s magic beans; a single foundry on a distant island makes most of the thinking rocks that go inside American phones. Yet if something were to happen to the supply of goods from those places, we always have the same answer: The royal mint can fix it. In truth, some combination of the two fairy tales now besets the American economy. The king probably threw too many free coins out the window last year, and some of our outlying lands are dragon-scarred. Yet if the climate scars on supply continue to grow, does the Federal Reserve have the right tools to manage? Stinson Dean, the lumber trader, is doubtful. \u201cRaising interest rates will blunt demand for housing\u2014no doubt. But if you blunt demand enough to bring lumber prices down, you\u2019re destroying the economy,\u201d Dean told me. \u201cFor us to have lower lumber prices, we can only build a million homes a year. Do you really want to do that? \u201cRaising rates,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t grow more trees.\u201d Nor does it grow more coffee, end a drought, or bring certainty to the energy transition. And if our new era of climate-driven inflation takes hold, America will need more than higher interest rates to bring balance to supply and demand.","headline":"The Rise of Greenflation","article_name":621456.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/greenflation-prices-inflation-climate-change-coffee-lumber\/621456\/","date_published":"2022-02-02 11:46:14","article_length":14273,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:11.890221","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/02\/greenflation-prices-inflation-climate-change-coffee-lumber\/621456\/","source":"atlantic"}

{"id":null,"body":"They did try, though. I\u2019ll be honest: It was just nice to hear them talk about climate change. Not that they did it very well or entirely coherently. But still\u2014more than eight minutes of discussion about climate policy! Among national politicians! On broadcast TV! What a concept! And they\u2019ll do it again tonight! Climate policy can sometimes feel like, I don\u2019t know, the fiber of American politics: Everyone knows they need more of it, but few actually want to do the work to get it. But for eight minutes on Wednesday, steel-cut oats were on the menu. That\u2019s about the highest praise of those short exchanges I can give, though. Discussion of climate change largely unfolded in two chunks. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Governor Jay Inslee of Washington mentioned it during the first minutes of the debate; during the second hour, the moderators Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow asked a larger group of candidates about their climate policy. The moderators asked some simplistic questions, and\u2014more important\u2014the candidates gave poor answers. And in a broader sense, Democrats still seem unsure of how to talk about climate change. It\u2019s clearly one of the party\u2019s biggest animating issues, but what kind of problem is it? Read: On climate, Democrats now have a plan to make a plan Warren has the clearest answer to this question. For her, climate change reveals another facet of the corruption of the American economy, her great theme. She brought up the warming climate during her first minute onstage, framing it as one symptom of an economy that\u2019s \u201cdoing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us,\u201d she said. Inslee, who has staked his candidacy on fighting climate change, talked about it as a dangerous event to be headed off. \u201cWe have to understand this is a climate crisis. An emergency,\u201d he said. He\u2019s running for president so that \u201con [his] last day on Earth,\u201d he can look his grandchildren in the eye and say he did \u201ceverything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas framed climate change as an assault on a distinctly American way of life. He mentioned his visit to Pacific Junction, Iowa, where he watched record-breaking floods rise. \u201cThere were farms outside of Pacific Junction that were lakes,\u201d he said, before connecting local farmers\u2019 ills to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. Both Warren and Inslee have latched on to a set of proposals called, as a whole, industrial policy. They aim to turn the United States into a net exporter of high-tech hardware. As Warren put it, \u201cStart with a place where there\u2019s a real need. There\u2019s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water. And we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward.\u201d Read: The Green New Deal\u2019s big idea Warren, Inslee, and, to a lesser extent, O\u2019Rourke have all proposed some version of industrial policy. But Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio was the first to actually utter the words. \u201cWe need an industrial policy saying we\u2019re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there\u2019s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years. I want half of them made in the United States,\u201d he said. That\u2019s when Warren went off to the races, describing her plan for a new American green-manufacturing sector. Inslee has such a plan too\u2014at this point, he has more than 100 pages of plans about how to remake the government to fight climate change. But Warren\u2019s rhetorical cohesiveness makes her task easier. Because climate change is already linked to the corrupt economy in her worldview, a climate fix that reinvigorates the economy makes more sense. Inslee, meanwhile, has to fight off the unrealistic expectation that he will be able to save the world. ( The Onion has started depicting him as a Captain Planet character .) Late in the debate, Maddow asked, \u201cWe are here in Miami, experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea-level rise, and parts of Miami Beach and the Keys could be under water in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?\u201d The fact is that Inslee cannot save Miami. Saving Miami\u2014or at least delaying its inundation\u2014will take heroic efforts from all countries working together. Inslee can lead those efforts, and as president, he would have many tools to encourage that kind of collaboration. His 100-plus pages of plans spell out a way to get there. But when given a climate question, he had to expand his rhetoric to encompass not just Miami but the whole issue, in the 60 seconds the candidates had to answer each question. He affirmed that climate change was an emergency, affirmed his intention to end the use of the legislative filibuster in the Senate, and then said, \u201cWe have to do what I have done in my state.\u201d Inslee has many accomplishments in Washington, including on the climate front, but saving Miami is not one of them. And this underscores a final problem: Climate is such a one-sided issue in American politics that no one is sure how to debate it yet. Political journalists are not finely attuned to the nuances of climate policy. Nor are candidates always at ease with nitty-gritty policy. So what should candidates talk about? How much they care about the issue? But then they are left with only insufficient if correct answers like Inslee\u2019s when challenged to save Miami: \u201cI am the candidate and the only one saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principal to mobilize the United States.\u201d","headline":"Democrats Still Don\u2019t Know How to Talk About Climate Change","article_name":592711.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/06\/democrats-still-dont-know-how-to-talk-about-climate-change\/592711\/","date_published":"2019-06-27 12:10:30","article_length":5765,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:12.887565","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/06\/democrats-still-dont-know-how-to-talk-about-climate-change\/592711\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Talk like a maverick. Act like an extremist Republican. There\u2019s a pattern shaping up in the Trump administration, at least when it comes to climate change. It works like this: Donald Trump, the president-elect himself, says something that sounds like he might be moderating on the issue. Then, his staff takes a radical action in the other direction. Last week, Trump told the staff of The New York Times  that he was keeping an open mind about the existence of climate change. \u201cI think there is some connectivity\u201d between human activity and the warming climate, Trump said. \u201cThere is some, something. It depends on how much.\u201d Of course, there is more than \u201csome\u201d connectivity. Scientists overwhelmingly recognize that humans have dramatically warmed the climate by emitting greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere now traps heat far more efficiently than it did even 50 years ago, quickly outpacing the \u201cnormal\u201d rate of planetary climate change . This worldwide warming trend has made 2016 the hottest year since modern meteorological records began, in 1880. The six warmest years ever measured have all happened in the past decade. The U.S. Department of Defense and a wide range of American medical associations recognize the reality of human-caused global warming. But Donald Trump once said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese , and he\u2019s frequently wondered how global warming can exist when it\u2019s still sometimes \u201creally cold\u201d in New York. ( Here\u2019s how .) So when he told the Times that he was keeping an open mind about global warming, it was taken by many as good news. I wrote about it , as did a slew of other publications. Trump\u2019s new quasi-moderation became a \u201c flip-flop \u201d or a \u201c major U-turn .\u201d Maybe Trump, ever the maverick, would finally allow the Republican Party to recognize the reality of climate change. But here\u2019s the second part of the two-step. While Trump was saying something almost moderate, his actual transition team was acting like a more extremist version of George W. Bush-era Republicans. A day after Trump talked to the Times , The Guardian reported that the Trump administration plans could cut all of NASA\u2019s Earth science research . NASA\u2019s scientists do some of the finest climate and weather science in the world, and the agency\u2019s fleet of Earth-observing satellites is peerless. Yet Bob Walker, a Trump campaign advisor, told the paper that all this was \u201cpolitically-correct environmental monitoring.\u201d \u201cI believe that climate research is necessary, but it has been heavily politicized, which has undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing,\u201d Walker told the Guardian . He said that some projects could be moved to other agencies. These plans are still up in the air. But the Trump team\u2019s staffing choices should also raise concerns. Myron Ebell, who is leading Trump\u2019s EPA transition team, helped lobby the second Bush administration to barely do anything to stop climate change. He has been involved in professional climate-change denial circles since the 1990s. Meanwhile, Politico  reports that the Heritage Foundation senior research fellow, Steven Groves, has been added to Trump\u2019s State Department transition team. Just last week, Groves called for the United States to leave the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the overarching treaty that governs how the world organizes itself to address global warming. Groves also said the U.S. should move to \u201cdismantle\u201d domestic climate regulations. A staffing choice isn\u2019t a firm policy decision, but there isn\u2019t much ambiguity about the Trump administration\u2019s intentions so far. Trump may be sounding a new tune on the existence of climate change. (Though some journalists read the New York Times comments to mean he hasn\u2019t changed his mind about it at all.) But his policy team seems to want to both squash research about global warming while withdrawing the United States from any diplomatic attempt to do anything about it. That\u2019s the Trump two-step. The president-elect may look like he\u2019s keeping an open mind, but his transition team is acting like a more extreme version of the Bush-era climate deniers.","headline":"Trump's Two-Step on Climate Change","article_name":508643.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-trump-two-step\/508643\/","date_published":"2016-11-28 09:30:00","article_length":4167,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:14.044038","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-trump-two-step\/508643\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Is climate change to blame for the Eastern United States\u2019s warm spell? Man, it\u2019s a warm one. At least, here in the eastern half of the United States it is. Since late last week, cities from Chicago to Atlanta to Boston have experienced decidedly un-seasonal heat, with temperatures dozens of degrees Fahrenheit above average. Here in D.C., we had our hottest December 12th since 1889 . In Lexington, Kentucky, they did us one better, breaking a record set during the Grant administration. As pleasant as this weather can be\u2014if it doesn\u2019t quite feel like Christmas in July, it\u2019s at least like Hanukkah in April\u2014the warmth can also provoke unease. Both memory and pop culture instruct that we should hope for a snowy Christmas , not a drizzly one. Sunny, clear days; 70-degree breezes: This is not what December is supposed to feel like around these parts. Something feels deeply wrong. Alexis Madrigal, an Atlantic contributing editor, coined a term for such weather: \u201cclimate changey.\u201d Scientists repeat that few individual weather events can be linked to climate change, and yet , how can an iced-coffee Advent be normal? Surveying an unprecedented California heatwave, historic flooding in South Carolina, and a strange and perplexing sandstorm in Tel Aviv, he wrote in October : \u201cWe need a word that reflects the basic anxiety of not knowing what the weather means anymore.\u201d Climate changey is that phrase. In Madrigal\u2019s telling, climate changey stands in for both the weather event and the mental state. In the 2010s, even when weird weather is enjoyable, it feels like a planetary memento mori. Say goodbye to that white Christmas\u2014more of this is coming, and also, by the way, you may die in it. An odd byproduct of writing and reporting about global warming and ocean acidification is that you\u2019re forced to conserve your anxiety. The whole thing is so worrying ( despite the recent Paris agreement ) that it doesn\u2019t make sense to freak out over a stretch of nice days. And that\u2019s especially true when there\u2019s a scientific basis for not connecting this warmth to global warming. Which is to say: Despite how climate changey these warm days feel, they\u2019re almost certainly the product of El Ni\u00f1o, not global warming . El Ni\u00f1o is a phase in the Pacific Ocean\u2019s multi-year cycle. During El Ni\u00f1o, warmer surface waters collect in the ocean\u2019s tropical and eastern half. (That is: The water off the western coasts of Central America\u2014and thousands of miles beyond that, into the open sea\u2014is much, much warmer than usual.) A band of low pressure forms over these warm waters. This week, that persistent low pressure has bumped the Jet Stream much further north than usual, sending subtropical air toward the Eastern United States. This year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o is one of the strongest ever: Last month, meteorologists ruled it \u201c too big to fail .\u201d It\u2019s helped bring cool rains to California, tempering that state\u2019s long drought; it also played a role in the massive Indonesia fires in September and October and the imminent drought in the Horn of Africa . Again, scientists haven\u2019t connected the strength of this El Ni\u00f1o to climate change, so you should feel free to enjoy the warmth, despite the climate-changey vibes. But a recent study indicated that global warming is likely to bring more mega El Ni\u00f1os like this one . Here in the East, it\u2019s looking like we\u2019ll have a warm, not a white, Christmas . So perhaps as you go out for your unorthodox Boxing Day jog, think back to 2010. That year, we experienced the Pacific Ocean\u2019s other major phase, La Ni\u00f1a, which is when warm waters pool in its western half. And while El Ni\u00f1o can bring snow, too\u2014in fact, some meteorologists think we\u2019re in for major storms in February of next year\u2014La Ni\u00f1a of 2010 did not fail to deliver: A post-Christmas blizzard carried more than a foot of snow to many of the same towns that have their windows open right now. \u201cSomeone needs to give us a good slap upside the head and say: \u2018Look, this is about you and you need to pay attention.\u2019\u201d","headline":"Is Climate Change to Blame for These Warm December Days?","article_name":420615.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/is-this-el-nino-or-just-fantasy-slash-climate-change\/420615\/","date_published":"2015-12-15 20:19:33","article_length":4006,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:14.453555","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2015\/12\/is-this-el-nino-or-just-fantasy-slash-climate-change\/420615\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"In Hungary, the pandemic was just an excuse. This article was updated at 10:05 a.m. ET on April 3, 2020 Viktor Orb\u00e1n is the prime minister of Hungary. He has been in power since 2010. During that time, he has underinvested in hospitals. Instead, public money has gone to pet projects, many of them related to the sports he enjoys. In his home village, Felcs\u00fat, the government built an elaborate soccer stadium with a heated field and 3,814 seats\u2014which, as The New York Times noted , is twice the number of people who live in the village. Meanwhile, the nearby county hospital\u2019s emergency ward has long struggled to cope with even an ordinary number of patients. On one evening in October, a visiting Times reporter found two harried doctors on call at midnight, and 30 people waiting for treatment. During the past decade, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has also misdirected European Union money\u2014some meant to encourage regional development in places like Felcs\u00fat, some meant specifically for medical development\u2014to friends and party comrades . This kind of corruption, coupled with the Hungarian government\u2019s nationalist rhetoric, has famously persuaded many educated people to leave the country, including doctors. Poor salaries in the health service haven\u2019t persuaded them to stay. Now, thanks to COVID-19, Hungary faces a looming health crisis, as well as an economic crisis. Who will Orb\u00e1n blame? The answer, dear reader, is: you. And me. And anyone inside or outside Hungary reading or distributing material critical of the Hungarian government. On March 30 , the Hungarian Parliament, which is controlled by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, Fidesz, voted to cancel all elections, suspend its own ability to legislate, and give the prime minister the right to rule by decree\u2014indefinitely. None of these powers is needed to fight the coronavirus. None of them fixes the existing problems in Hungarian hospitals. All of them will help the Hungarian government push through other measures. Almost immediately, they were used to pass controversial edicts on museum construction and theater management , and to prohibit transgender people from legally changing their sex \u2014issues without the remotest relevance to the pandemic. The government also wants to use its new powers to pass a decree classifying all information about a major Chinese railway investment in the country, the single largest infrastructure investment in Hungarian history. Once again, this has nothing to do with fighting the virus\u00a0 but it will conveniently keep the details of the business deal, and the names of the businessmen who benefit, out of the public view for 10 years. Like many others, I tweeted criticism of this de facto coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. The next day, some of those who searched for Anne Applebaum and Hungary received, as one of their top Google results, this message from the Hungarian government\u2019s English-language propaganda site, abouthungary.hu: \u201cCoronavirus Protection Act: The importance of saving Hungarian lives is clearly not a priority outside Hungary.\u201d Meanwhile, J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer, one of the leaders of Hungary\u2019s European parliamentary delegation, sent out a letter to foreign colleagues\u2014members of a pan-European alliance of center-right parties with which Fidesz is aligned\u2014accusing them of lacking concern for Hungarian lives. \u201cPlease,\u201d Sz\u00e1jer wrote, \u201cdo not hinder us by unfounded criticism in the midst of our fight!\u201d His use of hinder is extraordinary, for it implies, again, that foreign criticism will somehow harm Hungary\u2019s battle against the coronavirus. Not coincidentally, this is the same kind of language used by Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, Hungary\u2019s serially dishonest press spokesperson\u2014think Kellyanne Conway with facial hair\u2014when he speaks about Hungary\u2019s small but still vocal political opposition, as well as critiques from abroad. \u201cWe\u2019re in a state of emergency, by the way,\u201d he sneered in a posted comment . \u201cLives are at stake.\u201d For that reason, he wrote, the \u201cgross distortion\u201d of the \u201cfacts\u201d about the situation is \u201cbiased and irresponsible.\u201d State-controlled media have gone further, openly labeling the government\u2019s opponents as proponents of the virus. Why does this matter? Because although Hungary is a small country, it is one whose creeping authoritarianism is widely admired. In early February, I wrote about the rapturous reception that Orb\u00e1n had received at a conference of self-declared nationalist and far-right intellectuals\u2014American, Israeli, and European\u2014in Rome. I fully expect his tactics to be imitated: Anybody who disagrees with my emergency laws is trying to spread illness is something we will hear again. So is Whichever mistakes we made in the past, we are not responsible for them now . Indeed, I suspect that we will hear that sentiment again and again. In the United States, President Donald Trump has already blamed an extraordinary array of actors, from state governors to Barack Obama to China, for mistakes made by himself and his administration. Outside Hungary, other parliaments and assemblies have found ways to keep working. It\u2019s true that Britain\u2019s Parliament is in early recess; members departed for Easter six days earlier than they otherwise would have. But they have a designated date of return, and they are already setting up systems to conduct some business online. The European Parliament, meanwhile, is physically unable to meet: Many of its members\u2014my husband is one, from Poland\u2014literally have no way to get to the parliamentary chamber in Brussels, since planes have stopped flying and borders have closed. Nevertheless, members managed to debate and even to vote last week, using a bespoke online system. A variety of other parliaments, from the Danish Folketing to the German Bundestag, have set up special procedures to continue operations. Few lawmakers, at least so far, expect their government\u2019s emergency measures to be abused. If, by contrast, his European counterparts have little confidence in the Hungarian prime minister, that is his own fault. His government has had an \u201cemergency\u201d anti-migration decree in place since 2015, though anything resembling an immigration emergency has long passed. Yet criticism, both domestic and foreign, can have a positive effect, even in Budapest. Alongside measures about museums, theaters, and sex changes, Orb\u00e1n also issued a decree that would remove powers from local governments , many of which are led by opposition politicians. This was not only an egregious power grab; it may well have complicated the pandemic response in municipalities. In the wake of that edict, outrage was so loud and so sustained that the government withdrew the measure a mere 16 hours later. So ignore the Hungarian-government propagandists. Also ignore anyone else who tells you that their policy is above criticism, that politics don\u2019t apply in a pandemic, or that accountability and transparency need to be suspended for some indefinite period of time. The opposite is true: All of the decisions being made right now, whether medical or economic, deserve widespread scrutiny and debate. As Francis Fukuyama has written , there is no evidence that authoritarians are better than others at controlling disease; several democracies\u2014South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and perhaps Germany\u2014look like they have control of their coronavirus outbreaks. Nor does any evidence show that secrecy produces better outcomes; quite the contrary. There is evidence that effective bureaucracy, good information and good data will help us survive. If we are not only to get through this global crisis but come out on the other side better prepared, we also need to keep track of which decisions were made and when, and to remember who was responsible for them: in the United States and the United Kingdom, in China and Taiwan, in Germany and France, in South Africa and Brazil\u2014and in Hungary too.

{"id":null,"body":"What lurks in the Arctic\u2019s thawing permafrost? F rom the air , the coast of Greenland appears vast and tranquil. Hundreds of fjords, their surfaces a mirror of blue sky and cloud bottoms, divide the territory. In the gaps between them, the terrain folds over itself, hill over hill, descending into obsidian lakes. The turf is covered in the waxy pastels of alpine dwarf willows and the dull white of age-bleached lichen. Though an immense ice sheet sits in its interior, Greenland\u2019s ice-free coast encompasses almost 159,000 square miles and and houses 57,000 people. In other words, it is larger than Germany with a population half the size of Topeka, Peoria, or New Haven. It is possible to stand on a hill outside the coastal town of Ilulissat and hear only the grass quaking, the harbor ice dully grinding against itself. I visited Greenland because, lately, the land here has gone soft, and disquieting things threaten to wake in it. Let me orient you. At the top of the world, there is water. Television anchors sometimes speak of the Arctic Ocean as the \u201cpolar ice cap,\u201d but that is a contingency of temperature and a quirk of today\u2019s climate. Consider it instead a landlocked ocean, a northern Mediterranean Sea. Surrounding it sit great landmasses\u2014Europe, Asia, North America\u2014and a surfeit of islands. Among the largest are Svalbard, which is due north of Norway and so dense with polar bears that everyone who strays beyond its sole settlement must carry a rifle; Novaya Zemlya, the site of the largest atomic test ever conducted; and Greenland. In all of these places, rich, marshy soils run from the edge of the interior ice right up to the ocean cliffs. Once, this dirt gave rise to lush ferns and open grasslands; now, after 35,000 years of frigid cold, we call them permafrost . Despite their name, they are not permanently, or entirely, frozen. Every winter, a sheet of ice blossoms over the Arctic sea, and the soils seize shut with frost. Then, during the long summer days, the ice breaks up and the permafrost partially thaws. Lately, as summers have lengthened and winters have warmed, this seasonal transformation has lost its symmetry. What biologists call the permafrost\u2019s \u201cactive layer\u201d\u2014the part of the dirt where microbes and other forms of life can live\u2014now reaches farther underground, and further north, than it has for tens of thousands of years. The newly active permafrost is packed with old stuff : dead plants, dead animals, mosses buried and reburied by dust and snow. This matter, long protected from decomposition by the cold, is finally rotting, and releasing gases into the atmosphere that could quicken the rate of global warming. This matter is also full of pathogens: bacteria and viruses long immobilized by the frost. Many of these pathogens may be able to survive a gentle thaw\u2014and if they do, researchers warn, they could reinfect humanity. Climate change, in other words, could awaken Earth\u2019s forgotten pathogens. It is one of the most bizarre symptoms of global warming. And it has already begun to happen. T he Russian botanist Dmitri Ivanovsky was just 28 when, at a scientific meeting in St. Petersburg, he presented evidence of an unexplainable phenomenon: He had found a disease with no germ. When he exposed tobacco leaves to a certain clear liquid, he could watch the leaves mottle, but he could not find the bacteria under his microscope that could explain the change. In the decades before his work\u2014it was 1892\u2014Louis Pasteur and other scientists had demonstrated that microscopic life could cause disease. But here was a disease with no microbe at fault. Ivanovsky said that the disease must be inherent to the gloop he had put on the leaves. He termed it a virus , from the Latin word for slime. One hundred and twenty-five years later, we still use Ivanovsky\u2019s term, but we know viruses are far stranger than he ever imagined. An individual virion, the unit of viral existence, makes many copies of itself over its life cycle, but it never does something that can be described as living . It never breathes or mates. It punctures a cell\u2019s wall, hijacks its protein factories, and forces it to make more of itself. A single virion can make tens of thousands of copies of itself near instantly. Viruses are living nonlife, a desirous but mindless substance. At the frontier of viral life are Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel, two professors of microbiology at Aix-Marseilles University who happen to be married to each other. Since the turn of the century, they have established themselves as two of the world\u2019s most famous microbe hunters. In 2002, while researching Legionnaires\u2019 disease in their lab in Marseilles, they discovered the largest virus ever: Mimivirus, a virion so large that it could be seen under a microscope. They have identified four more monster viruses since, all several times larger than any virion known to science before 2000. Their menagerie oozes about in a far-flung set of landscapes: one monster virus was found in a shallow lake in Australia, another lurked in a bucket of seawater hauled off the Chilean coast. A third was discovered in a woman\u2019s contact lens. All of these mammoth viruses infect amoebae, not people. They do not pose an infective risk to us. But they are strange substances. They rival bacteria in size; they can be seen under a microscope. They are quite durable. And some of them produce more proteins than most amoebae. Claverie and Abergel weren\u2019t thinking of monster viruses when they began poking around in the permafrost. In 2013, Claverie read about a Russian team that had found a seed lodged deep in the permafrost. The fruit, buried some 125 feet below the surface, had spent thousands of years at about 20 degrees Fahrenheit, never thawing out in the wax and wane of seasons. But once warmed and placed in a pot, it sprouted waxy arms and delicate white flowers. Claverie contacted the Russian team, explained his work with microbes, and asked for a bit of permafrost to test. The team agreed, and they mailed Claverie and Abergel a sample of the same deep-frozen core of permafrost that had contained the seed. The pair pulled a small sample onto a high-resolution microscope, brought it to room temperature, introduced an amoeba as bait, and waited. And then, as they watched, a virus appeared in their viewfinder: Pithovirus sibericum, a massive ovular virion that had survived 30,000 years frozen in the ice core. It was also the largest virion ever discovered. \u201cWe tried to isolate amoeba viruses without knowing they were going to be giant viruses\u2014and a totally different type of virus than we already know appeared,\u201d Claverie said. \u201cIt turns out the viruses we are getting [in the permafrost] are extremely abnormal, extremely fancy.\u201d Claverie and Abergel\u2019s viruses aren\u2019t a threat to humanity\u2014yet. But human pathogens have also survived freezing and thawing in the permafrost. Last summer, an outbreak of anthrax in Siberia infected dozens of people and killed one child. The vector of disease is thought to be the thawing and decaying carcass of a reindeer killed in 1941. And a team of Canadian scientists recently found a strain of bacteria, Paenibacillus , in a cave in New Mexico that had been closed off for more than 4 million years. Though harmless to humans, the ancient bacteria was resistant to most clinical antibiotics, including most of the newest and most aggressive. The discovery suggested that bacteria can survive the most exotic and remote environments. Researchers are continuing to test the limits of pathogens. Reportedly, a Soviet microbiology lab revived bacteria from the permafrost in the 1980s, but its paper went little noticed. Claverie is traveling to Siberia this year to core even deeper into the soil, to prove that viruses can survive being thawed out after a million years. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to go deeper and deeper in our sampling, to demonstrate that it is possible that viruses could survive\u2014amoeba viruses. We are not going to try to revive human viruses, of course, we are not crazy,\u201d he said. He already frets about what climate change will unlock in the permafrost, especially when humans help it along. Take Greenland, for instance. Right now, the island is a territory of Denmark, the country that colonized it three centuries ago. Greenland is slowly severing itself from Europe\u2014in 2009, its government took over every government function from Denmark except defense and foreign policy. Denmark still pays out a block grant to Greenland every year equal to roughly two-thirds of its government budget, but independence will likely mean giving that up. To fill that eventual budget hole, Greenland has explored opening six new mines across the country. Greenland abounds in minerals\u2014the island\u2019s south contains the largest reserve of untapped rare-earth elements on the planet\u2014but the Arctic\u2019s dangerous seas and extreme temperatures have ensured they\u2019ve never been mined. Climate change will solve both those problems, so to speak. In a paper this year in the European Journal of Internal Medicine, Claverie worried about the pathogenic consequences of opening the Arctic Ocean, specifically around Siberia and the Russian Arctic, to commercial traffic. \u201cWe know, and the Russians know, there are a lot of resources there. Very precious metals, rare-earths, petrol, there is gas and gold,\u201d he told me. Greenland is not separate from these pressures. Getting at the minerals and petroleum deposits throughout the Arctic, he says, will require moving a lot of permafrost\u2014an amount properly measured in millions of tons. \u201cAt once, you are going to excavate 16 million tons of permafrost that has not been moved or perturbed in a million years of time,\u201d he said. He imagines towering heaps of rotting permafrost stacked up next to mining cabins, their contents open to the sun and air and summer rain. \u201cWe are really reaching places where, if there are microbes infectious to humans or human ancestors, we are going to get them,\u201d he says. If one of these contagions does get loose in Greenland, Luit Penninga will be one of the first men to deal with it. He is the lead surgeon at Ilulissat Hospital in Greenland. His office looks out across Disko Bay, a gray sea 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle disturbed by azure-edged icebergs and the occasional breaching tail of a humpback whale. His entire life is dictated by the scarcity of Arctic medicine. The night before I met Penninga, he boarded a red helicopter and rode it across the bay to meet a woman suffering a pregnancy out of the womb. She lives in the village of Uummannaq, population 1,200, which has no doctors of its own. He helped her board the helicopter, attended to her through the flight, and\u2014when the helicopter landed at Ilulissat Hospital\u2014operated on her. It was successful. Early the next morning he invited me to visit the hospital. When I meet him, he is gentle and calm. Health care in Greenland is socialized\u2014all hospitals are state-owned and all medical care and prescription drugs are free\u2014and the vast country is split into regions. Since Penninga leads health care in Ilulissat, he oversees human health across the entire northwest half of the world\u2019s largest island\u2014from Ilulissat, the country\u2019s third-largest city, to Qaanaaq, a small town of 650 that overlooks the Arctic Ocean. Seventeen thousand people live in the region, mostly in small villages accessible only from boat or helicopter, spread out over an area larger than France. Penninga must sometimes take the three-hour flight between Qaanaaq and Ilulissat, a distance of more than 700 miles (1173 km). It costs $1400. From Qaanaaq, it\u2019s another hour-long helicopter ride to reach some of the smallest villages, where people hunt seal and walrus as their ancestors have for generations. These transportation costs add up: In any year, between 10 and 15 percent of Greenland\u2019s national health budget is spent on transportation costs alone. Penninga treats snowmobile and dogsled accidents, appendicitis and chlamydia and pneumonia. Many of the worst ailments are bacterial: A particularly aggressive form of ear infection, which seems endemic to Greenland, can leave holes in kids\u2019 eardrums that last for years, permanently inhibiting their performance in school. The island also seems to have its own form of sepsis, which doctors learn to fear after a couple years of working there. \u201cSome people can have a very short course of disease\u2014they develop sepsis, very shortly come in, and die,\u201d he said. When I asked him about the zombie pathogens, he laughed and nodded. \u201cThey say that, yes,\u201d he told me. Penninga has enough problems. Some of the microbes lurking in the permafrost may be familiar: adversaries that humanity already knows and believes it has defeated. The World Health Organization brags that it has eradicated smallpox, for instance\u2014other than the stores in the United States and Russia\u2014but Claverie warns that it could well have survived in the tundra. Even more worrisome are the microbes we don\u2019t know. \u201cNo one really understands why Neanderthals went extinct,\u201d Claverie said. Sometimes, he catches himself when talking about these possible permafrost-locked diseases\u2014they may have threatened humans or human relatives in the past, he\u2019ll say. Then, he\u2019ll change tense, emphasizing that they could do so again. Two weeks after I left Greenland, a patch of permafrost not far from Penninga\u2019s office burst into flame. The press marveled around the world:  a wildfire on the tundra. It raged for weeks as authorities tried to figure out how to keep it from causing anyone harm. The problem itself, the logistics involved in addressing it, required a response no one had anticipated or practiced for. Eventually, rain put it out. Such emergencies\u2014those that overwhelm our understanding of \u201cknown knowns\u201d\u2014are among the most unsettling portents of climate change. Whether the emergencies of the coming century arrive in the form of fires, or floods, or plagues that rise invisibly from the ground, they\u2019re likely to become more and more extreme and less and less familiar\u2014a fantastical parade of crises we will be shocked to find ourselves battling. Even in its quietest places, the world will become newly hostile. Enjoy unlimited access to The Atlantic.

{"id":null,"body":"And that\u2019s only counting the floods caused by hurricanes and tropical storms. New York is a city on the water. For hundreds of years, its rivers and harbor have worked to its advantage, bringing it speedy transportation and pleasant temperatures. The next couple hundred years may not be as smooth sailing. Global warming, caused by the release of carbon-dioxide pollution into the atmosphere, will cause the seas to rise and the storms to intensify around the city. A new study from an all-star list of climate scientists attempts to estimate how a few of climate change\u2019s symptoms\u2014higher seas, large storm surge, and more intense hurricanes\u2014will intersect in New York over the next 300 years. It isn\u2019t pretty. Sea-level rise will make every tropical cyclone that hits New York more likely to release damaging floods. For instance, storm floods of nearly seven-and-a-half feet once occurred only a couple times per millennium. In today\u2019s somewhat warmed climate, 7.5-foot floods are projected to happen every 25 years. By 2030, these floods will occur every five years. New York City has experienced 7.5-foot floods several times in the past decade. Superstorm Sandy loosed 10- or 11-foot floods on much of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, killing 43 people and inundating more than 88,000 buildings. Not all of the news from the study\u2019s estimates was bad. In a climate-changed world, the effects of storm surge on New York may remain about the same. Even though future hurricanes are likely to be more intense \u2014and thus more likely to \u201cpush\u201d more water in front of them, as storm surge\u2014the hurricane models also showed the same storms avoiding New York Harbor. In other words, global warming seems to redirect some of the largest hurricanes eastward. It\u2019s unclear why this may be the case. Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and the first author of the paper, described the shift as \u201cthe biggest surprise from this work.\u201d \u201cThe eastward shift in storm tracks at the latitude of NYC in future simulations [was] a result that we did not expect to find, and something that we hope to investigate further with future research,\u201d she told me in an email. The study is the first to compare data from three sources: models of storm surge in New York City; probabilistic projections of sea-level rise; and advanced climate models that include high-resolution hurricane simulations. Its coauthors include Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Bob Kopp, a climate economist at Rutgers University; and Michael Mann and Richard Alley, two geoscientists at Pennsylvania State University. The study also investigates how hurricane flooding will be affected by the possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The timing of the ice sheet\u2019s collapse remains debated: While some models suggest that a warmed world will erode the ice sheet between the years 2200 and 3000, newer and more aggressive studies argue it could collapse within decades . Its collapse will have profound consequences for the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, as its powerful gravitational pull currently keeps sea levels on that coast unusually low. If it does begin to fall into the sea, ocean levels worldwide could rise five to six feet by 2100. \u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind, looking at flood risk associated with tropical cyclones, to incorporate such \u2018worst-case scenario\u2019 sea-level rise projections,\u201d said Garner. The study doesn\u2019t capture every kind of flooding event that New York will experience\u2014only spinning tropical storms. It doesn\u2019t account for systems like Superstorm Sandy, for instance, which became a more disorganized \u201cextratropical cyclone\u201d before it made landfall.","headline":"Climate Change Will Bring Major Flooding to New York Every 5 Years","article_name":543708.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/climate-change-nyc-floods\/543708\/","date_published":"2017-10-24 08:30:00","article_length":3738,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:18.226095","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/climate-change-nyc-floods\/543708\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"To fight climate change, get a white roof. Updated at 12:30 p.m. ET on August 31, 2022 T ime was , we didn\u2019t worry much about summer heat on the wet side of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s Cascade Curtain. A \u201chot day\u201d meant 80 degrees Fahrenheit; over 90 was a rare scorcher, and 100 was unheard-of until one day in 1994 touch\u200b\u200bed that mark. Feeling warm? Open a window, rummage in the basement for a fan, pop a cold one, and wait for the evening breeze to cool things down. Air conditioners, like umbrellas, were for wimps and tourists. All of that started changing in 2015, when Seattle saw a record 12 days of 90-plus weather and Earth embarked on its hottest seven years (and counting) ever recorded. In 2021, the sort of lethal heat wave that had raged from Australia to Arizona to Paris to Siberia finally struck here. One hundred became the new 90; the thermometer broke the triple-digit barrier three days running and topped out at an unthinkable 108. The Cascade Mountains still protect us from wildfires, for now. But unprecedented wildfire smoke\u2014another consequence of climate change\u2014has repeatedly made the air unbreathable as well as unbearable. That heat hit especially hard in my bedroom, located on the sunny west side of my house\u2019s finished attic. On summer afternoons and evenings, it began to feel like an oven in there. I cut in some attic vents, which helped; then it merely felt like a sauna. But last autumn, I finally had to replace the clapped-out roof. It seemed obvious: A pale roof would cool the house down better than a dark one, so I ordered bright white metal for the shed gable and, for the steeply pitched portion, the only Energy Star\u2013certified asphalt shingles I found in the catalog offered by Tekline Roofing\u2014a speckled gray-white called \u201cSilver Birch,\u201d which had several times the reflectance of the other tones offered. Word came back that the manufacturer, CertainTeed, a division of the French conglomerate Saint-Gobain, had dropped the color. But Chris Hagen, a Tekline representative, suggested I call the warehouse and see if it had any leftover shingles lurking around. \u201cSilver Birch will come back,\u201d Mark Ivers, CertainTeed\u2019s regional manager, told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s only available in Hawaii for now. We had to reduce offerings because of supply-chain issues, and it was less popular than the others.\u201d But, sure, they were about to ship a load to Hawaii and could save a few bundles for me. When this summer came around, my birch-bark-toned roof was ready and waiting to bat away the heat. Even without air-conditioning, blazing days and afterglow evenings are now only comfortably warm. And it looks fine against the house\u2019s light-gray siding and dark trim. But as I scanned my neighbors\u2019 uniformly dark roofs, I realized that mine stood out like white sneakers at a black-tie ball. The professionals confirmed my impression. \u201cTwenty years ago, when I got into this business, a lot more colors were used,\u201d Hagen told me. \u201cTans, brown, green. In the last seven or eight years, it\u2019s been black and gray\u2014really dark colors.\u201d Moir\u00e9 Black, Georgetown Gray, and Weathered Wood, to be precise. All this despite the fact that light shingles tend to last longer than dark ones; they stretch, contract, and crack less in the heat. Factor in energy costs and they\u2019re a bargain: A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that white roofs cost considerably less over their lifetime than both black and sustainability-flaunting grassy \u201cgreen roofs,\u201d which have other environmental benefits but cost more to install and, contrary to popular belief, don\u2019t do much to counter global warming. Researchers at Australia\u2019s University of New South Wales, another hotbed of cool-roof research, determined that such roofs reduced indoor temperatures by up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit. This can save lives as well as pocketbooks: Researchers found that living on the top floor under a black roof was \u201ca major risk factor in mortality\u201d in Chicago\u2019s July 1995 heat wave. Cooler roofs and whiter walls may explain why fewer people die in heat waves in Greece and North Africa than in France, Russia, and other countries to the north; all that whitewash isn\u2019t just for scenic effect. I t\u2019s all a matter of albedo, the share of sunlight that gets reflected. Perfect white would have an albedo of 1.0; perfect black, of 0. Albedo is an important factor in the \u201cheat island\u201d effect\u2014the gaping disparities between air temperatures in cities (especially in unshaded, low-income neighborhoods) and surrounding rural areas. The Berkeley Lab\u2019s Heat Island Group measured the albedo of roofs in major California cities, using cameras that capture invisible near-infrared radiation as well as visible light. Roof albedo in Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, and San Jose averaged 0.17 to 0.18. Given that buildings typically cover a fifth to a quarter of urban land, that\u2019s a whole lot of heat getting absorbed. Blame small roofs, mostly on houses, which constitute 60 to 70 percent of total roofing surface. They proved even darker than roofs overall, with average albedos of 0.14 to 0.17. Commercial-building owners, nudged by building codes and government incentives, are more likely to embrace reflective surfaces (and lower cooling costs) when they reroof, while homeowners cling stubbornly to dark roofs. This is puzzling, and troubling. Why would people choose hot roofs when the climate is getting hotter? Hagen sees a persistent \u201cundertow of people wanting contrast, a dark roof with light siding\u201d\u2014the prevailing fashion. I suspect we can blame anxiety over property values; call it Zillow syndrome. With inflated home prices composing larger shares of owners\u2019 net worth, who wants to take a chance? This is the sort of thinking that has supported water-sucking green lawns in places like Arizona, not to mention racist exclusionary covenants across the country. The roofing industry itself encourages it. The website of Apple Roofing, which has offices from Florida to South Dakota, credited dark shades with \u201csignificantly improving curb appeal.\u201d (Sometime after I spoke with an executive there, this reference was removed.) Its blog argues that the choice between dark and light shingles \u201cshould really be about your color preference and curb-appeal over cooling costs \u2026 You can rest easy knowing proper ventilation and insulation will ensure the color has no effect on heating costs!\u201d For roofers and manufacturers, such reassurances represent the path of least resistance\u2014or, less graciously, pandering to consumers. And, because light shingles generally cost more to produce (the rock granules embedded in the asphalt base need an extra kiln-fired coating), dark shingles let companies charge higher margins or offer customers lower prices. T he more I learned about the benefits of cooler roofs, the more surprised I was by how little those in the residential roofing industry talked about them. The common good doesn\u2019t usually drive purchasing decisions, but the collective benefits here are significant. Berkeley Lab calculates that switching to light-colored roofing worldwide could offset the carbon emissions of 300 million automobiles over 20 years. The roofers I spoke with tended to disregard these impacts. The Apple Roofing COO Marcus Kuhlmann hadn\u2019t even heard of heat islands: \u201cThat\u2019s not something we talk about in our business.\u201d As he (like others in the industry ) sees it, \u201cat the end of the day, it balances out\u2014you want dark shingles in winter to absorb heat, light shingles in summer to reflect it.\u201d Take your pick. Dark shingles may indeed help reduce heating costs in colder regions. But even in winter, collecting heat through the roof is generally a bad idea; it can trap moisture in the attic, causing wood rot, and produce roof-wrecking ice dams. If you\u2019re worried about reducing energy consumption in cold weather, improving your home\u2019s insulation is a better bet. Properly installed insulation can also keep houses cooler on hot days. But even then, there are trade-offs. Insulation traps heat from cooking, lighting, bathing, and other indoor sources, and the result is sometimes a hotter house in summer. Besides, insulation doesn\u2019t deflect heat; it impounds it, slowing conduction for a few hours. This means that a large share of midday heat reaches indoor spaces at day\u2019s end, when workplaces, homes, stores, and restaurants are all occupied. So people crank up their air conditioners, and electricity demand peaks, which can overload the grid. Good ventilation actually does whisk heat out of buildings, but only out into the urban island and global atmosphere. Air-conditioning likewise pumps heat outdoors, all the while consuming power typically generated with fossil fuels\u2014a vicious cycle. As Ronnen Levinson, the head of Berkeley\u2019s Heat Island Group and its Cool Surfaces Manhattan Project , puts it, \u201cThe only way to get the heat out of the system is to send it back to space, where it becomes the Martians\u2019 problem, not ours.\u201d That is, to reflect it. Governments worldwide have generally lagged in promoting or requiring cool roofs for homes. After New South Wales\u2019s planning minister announced a coming ban on dark roofing, developers protested; the plan was scrapped and the minister demoted. In this country, a modest federal tax credit for cool roofs expired last year. And in June, after a decade of opposition from trade groups, the EPA stopped offering Energy Star roofing ratings . At least 21 state and municipal governments have code requirements or development credits for cool roofs, but according to Sarah Schneider of the Cool Roof Rating Council , most apply to commercial, not residential, roofs. And so, figuring that cool, sensible roofs wouldn\u2019t come into their own anytime soon, I sought consolation in smug solitude, like an early Prius adopter. Then I learned that Saint-Gobain had dropped a wild card. Unbeknownst to me, a year or two before I chose my new roof, the company began offering dark roofing that is also highly reflective. The trick is a granule coating that deflects near-infrared light while letting visible light through. Now you can go dark and still be cool. Ivers, the CertainTeed regional manager, said these \u201cSolaris CoolRoof\u201d shingles cost just 10 to 15 percent more than basic ones. He\u2019s persuaded some contractors to offer them, but most don\u2019t seem interested. Such shingles are a smart technological advance, but the industry isn\u2019t exactly shouting it from the rooftops. \u201cPeople are creatures of habit,\u201d Ivers told me. \u201cThey go with what they\u2019ve already been doing.\u201d So we drive our thirsty SUVs, fly far and near, gorge on steaks and burgers, install dark roofs, and crank up the air-conditioning\u2014even when climate-friendly and budget-friendly alternatives are available. If business, government, and consumers can\u2019t get serious about this small piece of the climate crisis, how are we ever going to deal with the whole looming catastrophe? This article originally credited the Berkeley Lab with helping develop Saint-Gobain's new dark roofing. The lab did not work on that product.","headline":"The Homeowner\u2019s Sunshine Problem","article_name":671287.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/08\/fight-climate-change-get-white-roof\/671287\/","date_published":"2022-08-31 11:00:00","article_length":11097,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:18.892444","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/08\/fight-climate-change-get-white-roof\/671287\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"For Democrats, climate change is now one of the two most important issues in politics, according to a new poll. Updated at 1:05 p.m. ET on February 21, 2020. It\u2019s not a fluke, an error, or an outlier. In poll after poll, the results are clear: Climate change is one of the most important issues in the 2020 presidential election. A new survey , released today and provided exclusively to The Atlantic, only drives the point home: Climate is the clear number-two issue\u2014second only to health care\u2014for Democrats who live in one of the upcoming primary or caucus states. Among all voters, the warming planet is now one of the most salient issues in American politics. The poll was conducted by Climate Nexus, a nonpartisan nonprofit group, in partnership with researchers at Yale and George Mason University, and included nearly 2,000 registered voters. Climate change now sits alongside only four other mainstays\u2014health care, the economy and jobs, immigration policy, and Social Security\u2014in its ability to command the electorate\u2019s attention. And for self-described liberal Democrats, climate change is now nationally the most important issue, beating out 28 others, Anthony Leiserowitz , a senior research scientist at Yale, told me. \u201cThis is the first time in American political history where climate change is not just a top-tier issue\u2014it is the  top-tier issue,\u201d \u200bsaid \u200bLeiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication , which helped conduct the new poll\u200b. Yet while Democrats have grown ever more alarmed by climate change, self-identified Republicans remain largely unmoved. In the poll, Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say climate change is one of their top two issues, and they support more aggressive policies. This reflects a deepening divide among Americans: Climate change, Leiserowitz said, \u201chas become more polarized now than any other issue, including abortion.\u201d Read: A very important climate fact that no one knows The Climate Nexus poll was conducted online from February 6 to February 9, among 1,934 respondents in 26 states. Each of those states\u2014they include Nevada, South Carolina, California, and Texas\u2014will hold a Democratic primary or caucus between now and March 17. Climate Nexus then weighted the responses from each state in line with Census Bureau estimates of local age, gender, race, education, and Hispanic demographics. In addition to the Yale team, Climate Nexus partnered with the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication for the poll. The poll\u2019s results fit into a remarkably consistent pattern: American voters are taking climate change seriously. Last March, a CNN\/ Des Moines Register poll found that climate change was a top-two issue for Iowa Democrats. Since then, the same results have kept showing up in opinion surveys, exit polls, and Associated Press vote-cast data, Leiserowitz said. Earlier this week, the Pew Research Center announced that a majority of Americans now say dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Since 2016, that number has increased by 14 percentage points. And in another all-time high, nearly as many Americans (64 percent) now rank protecting the environment as highly as they do strengthening the economy, the Pew report found. Some of this effect may reflect President Trump\u2019s broad rejection of climate policy and embrace of fossil fuels. It is common for public polling to swing in the opposite direction of the incumbent president\u2019s policy views, a phenomenon that political scientists call \u201cthermostatic public opinion.\u201d And while the polling shows that concern about climate change is growing, it also reveals that views are divided by party. \u201cOver the past five years, public concern about climate change has soared, particularly among Democrats. It\u2019s also gone up substantially among independents, but it\u2019s stayed relatively flat among Republicans,\u201d Leiserowitz said. Last month, a separate study from the Yale and George Mason University teams found that ideology and partisan affiliation still strongly predict a voter\u2019s views on the climate. While more than 70 percent of Democrats say that global warming is caused by human activities, only a slim majority (51 percent) of moderate Republicans agree, as do only 25 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. The new poll, which was conducted using different methods, shows some signs of that disconnect. Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they were very worried or somewhat worried about climate change, it found\u2014more than those who said the United States is on the wrong track (52 percent) or approved of Donald Trump\u2019s performance as president (45 percent). Those worries matched a growing desire for stronger climate policy, the poll found. Among all voters, seven out of 10 said the government should do more about climate change. Fifty-nine percent of respondents went further, saying they would strongly or moderately support a Green New Deal. Only 25 percent of respondents said they strongly or somewhat opposed such an aggressive measure. More moderate policies were more popular. Nearly three-quarters of all voters said they wanted a candidate who would set stronger pollution standards, and 70 percent said they wanted the next president to strengthen federal fuel-economy standards. ( As I reported earlier this month , the Trump administration has fought for years to weaken the fuel-economy rules.) And nearly four in five voters, from all parties, support providing \u201cassistance, job training, or guaranteed wages\u201d to workers from the oil, gas, and coal industries who have lost their jobs. Not every climate policy commanded a majority. Roughly the same percentage of voters (42 percent) support opening up new federal lands for oil and gas drilling as oppose it (41 percent), the poll found. Every Democratic presidential candidate, from Amy Klobuchar to Bernie Sanders, has said they oppose such an expansion. Perhaps the most intriguing finding: Large majorities of voters want most future energy infrastructure to come from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. More than 70 percent of voters said that they would support requiring 100 percent of electricity in their state to come from wind and solar plants by the year 2050. Most respondents said such a policy would boost the economy, lower electricity costs, and help rural and farming communities in their state. Most also said it would have either a positive effect, or no effect at all, on workers\u2019 wages and the unemployment rate. It\u2019s a commonplace in climate politics that Americans love solar and wind energy, but this has not, so far, translated into market power for the technologies. Read: How solar and wind got so cheap, so fast The poll also asked about a series of head-to-head matchups between Donald Trump and one of the Democratic candidates. Joe Biden did nearly as well as Buttigieg, winning 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 42 percent. Elizabeth Warren tied Trump in the head-to-head matchup, and Klobuchar lost by one point. In every case, the number of undecided voters was larger than the winner\u2019s margin. The full list of states polled for the survey were\u2014take a deep breath\u2014Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. It\u2019s not as if candidates are ignorant of this shift in voter priorities. Every Democratic candidate has announced a climate plan and talks about it on the stump.

In televised debates, such as the one earlier this week in Nevada, Democratic candidates hurried to bring up climate change before any questions about it were asked.

{"id":null,"body":"A story about looking for a new world is more exciting than a movie about saving an ailing one. There is already plenty of evidence of America\u2019s alarming inability to reckon with climate change, but perhaps none is more surprising than this: Even Hollywood doesn\u2019t get it. The entertainment industry is rightly thought of as a haven for progressive thought, but in the last few years, while it has made big-budget blockbusters about income inequality ( The Hunger Games ), the dangers of a corporate government ( The Lego Movie ), and the surveillance state ( Captain America: The Winter Soldier ), Hollywood has yet to adequately address the issue of climate change. Of course, neither has any government in the world, and maybe for the same reason: When faced with unpleasant realities, we all prefer a fantasy. Which brings us to Interstellar . The film has divided public and critical opinion; to some, it is a majestic and optimistic work of science fiction, but its detractors find the narrative structure too clunky, the dialogue too corny, and its insights about the transcendent power of love hollow and unearned. But no matter how you feel about Interstellar as a piece of entertainment, one thing should be agreed upon: As a climate-change parable, it fails. Climate change is never mentioned by name in the film, but writer\/director Christopher Nolan uses its imagery to define the terms of his story. Interstellar is set in a near-future Earth on the verge of total ecological collapse, with drastic changes in weather patterns and devastating food shortages driving human beings to the brink of extinction. We never learn exactly what caused this devastation (there is a vague reference to a crop disease called \u201ca blight\u201d), but Cooper, the tough and tender protagonist played by Matthew McConaughey, pins it on a failure of the human spirit: \u201cWe used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt,\u201d he says early on. When he is asked to lead a secret NASA expedition to look for another planet to colonize, he gets a chance to live by those words. Those words also serve as Nolan\u2019s plea to the Western world to invest more in research and technological invention\u2014which means that after TV\u2019s Cosmos and this year\u2019s terrific documentary Particle Fever, Interstellar is the latest attempt to arouse interest in the sciences through pop culture. But by placing his plea in the context of our climate change crisis, Nolan has set up a false choice: In the world of Interstellar, mankind can either leave the planet behind, or it can stay here and die. The choices that humans\u2014here in the real world\u2014actually have to make regarding climate change and the future of the earth are much more complicated, and are nowhere to be found onscreen. The heroes in Interstellar do not talk much about their mistakes on Earth. Nor do they learn anything of value except that love, you know, transcends space and time. And so it stands to reason that whatever planet the humans in Interstellar end up colonizing, they will destroy it just as surely as a virus destroys its host. The film does give voice to the idea that we can at least acknowledge our mistakes; an early scene has Cooper\u2019s father-in-law (John Lithgow) lamenting the human excess that defined the 21st century, but it only comes off as a token, as the movie is clearly more interested in looking forward than to the past. In this way, Nolan fails to look inward and uncover the flaws and solutions in humanity; instead, he prefers to gaze up at the stars and fantasize. Of course, filmmakers have a right\u2014or even a duty\u2014to fantasize, but a small tweak could made Interstellar \u2019s message much more relevant to the present day. There is a good scene early scene in the film, a parent-teacher conference in which Cooper discovers that the latest version of his daughter\u2019s textbooks states that NASA faked the Apollo 11 moon landing in order to trick the Soviet Union into wasting all of its resources in the space race. When the teacher explains that children need to be taught not to sink precious funding into fantasies like space travel, Cooper replies that the Apollo missions created technology that led to the MRI machine, showing how investments in space travel can lead to unintended benefits on Earth. It\u2019s a great point. Cooper\u2019s subsequent mission does lead to discoveries\u2014black-hole data showing how to manipulate gravity\u2014that save humanity by allowing it to leave Earth. It would have been more compelling, though, for Nolan to have those discoveries be ones that allow humanity to stay on Earth. For those who care about climate change, the film feels like a missed opportunity. But it\u2019s not a surprising one, given Hollywood\u2019s recent track record. Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all-time had a pro-environment ethos, but amidst the three-dimensional cinematography and one-dimensional performances, the message seemed lost on the audience. More recently, two indie films\u2014 The East and Night Moves \u2014tried to put a human face on the radical environmentalist movement, but they both made crucial errors in depicting their protagonists as all-too-willing to sacrifice human lives to make their points. In real life, green activists sometimes destroy property, but never people, and these films would have provided great fodder for anti-environmentalists, if anyone had seen them. Why does Hollywood keep getting the environment wrong? Maybe it\u2019s for the same reasons that politicians have been unable to fix it: Because the ways that climate change and other environmental crises can be addressed are not dramatic or awe-inspiring. The dangers of doing nothing are horrifyingly cinematic, but the solutions are prosaic and dull. But it would be nice to see a filmmaker try to make them entertaining. After watching the real-life NASA fail even to get an unmanned rocket off the ground two weeks ago, the events of Interstellar seems even more far-fetched, and left me wishing its solution did exist not in the dirt or the stars, but somewhere in between.","headline":"Why 'Interstellar' Ignores Climate Change","article_name":382788.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2014\/11\/why-interstellar-ignores-climate-change\/382788\/","date_published":"2014-11-15 15:15:00","article_length":6105,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:20.393886","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2014\/11\/why-interstellar-ignores-climate-change\/382788\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees of global warming might be dramatic. When the nations of the world ratified the Paris Agreement, they adopted two different goals for how much they hoped they could limit climate change. While pledging to keep global warming \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius, they also said they would try to \u201c limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees .\u201d It was a hopeful and ambitious moment in climate diplomacy\u2014and one not yet matched by policy. The only way to keep warming that minimal is to cut emissions much faster than almost any country is currently planning. Many scientists and policymakers consider hitting the 2-degree goal extremely difficult , and the 1.5-degree goal all but impossible given today\u2019s technology. A study published this week in Science  emphasizes the importance of both goals. Unless global temperatures are kept below 2 degrees, the biomes of the Mediterranean Basin will change more by the year 2100 than they have in the past 10,000 years. Biomes are ecological regions that share similar flora, fauna, and weather. Desert, deciduous forest, and Alpine meadow are all types of biome. The study finds that many regions of the Mediterranean will undergo such stress that\u2014under all but the kindest warming scenarios\u2014biomes are likely to significantly change in the next century, as forests become scrubland and scrubland becomes desert. \u201cUnder the [business-as-usual] scenario, all of southern Spain turns into desert, deciduous forests invade most of the mountains, and Mediterranean vegetation replaces most of the deciduous forests in a large part of the Mediterranean basin,\u201d write the study\u2019s authors. The paper also begins to fill in a hole in available climate science: how the newer, leaner 1.5-degree goal improves on the 2-degree goal in different regions of the world. (Most biome models were built around the older 2-degree warming aim.) It finds that 1.5-degree averts most of the disruptive biome change. \u201cThe difference between global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius\u2014just a small 0.5 degrees\u2014is significant and not harmless,\u201d said Joel Guiot, a paleoclimatologist at Aix-Marseille University and one of the authors of the study, in an email. \u201cIt is really important to limit the warming to much less [than] 2 degrees to avoid changes not experienced during the last 10,000 years.\u201d The study, by Guiot and his colleague Wolfgang Cramer, is the first to run the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goals through BIOME4, a global model of biome geography. BIOME4 is not the most state-of-the-art biome model, but it is the fastest\u2014it doesn\u2019t require months of data-center or supercomputer time. First, Guiot and Cramer used the model to estimate the next century of biome change in Europe, given various warming pathways for the planet. Then they compared it to model runs for the past 10,000 years. Those runs were restricted by knowledge gained from pollen sediment core data\u2014evidence of old biomes trapped in sedimentary rock. Even under the \u201cmoderate\u201d warming scenarios, the model estimates that Mediterranean scrubland will expand and Alpine forests will recede. Simon Goring, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said that the paper convincingly argued that climate change will trigger biome shifts, and not just change how biomes work within their current regions. \u201cWe know there have been short-term changes in climate, but this [21 st -century warming] is outside the envelope of any of the current forest biomes in the region,\u201d he told me. This especially applies in the Balkans, where cool mixed forest is forecast to get much warmer. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing everything out of that boundary, because the forest can\u2019t tolerate them.\u201d Part of that change is that biome changes will happen for different reasons in the century to come than they have in the Holocene. During the past epoch, biomes tended to shift because of changing precipitation patterns due to the changing location of the intertropical convergence zone . Temperature was relatively stable. In the years to come, biome change\u2014and precipitation\u2014will be driven by rising temperatures. Jack Williams, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Wisconsin, said the study\u2019s findings were important though preliminary. \u201cTheir takeaway message is that 1.5 degrees of warming, and the ecosystem changes that result, is at the upper end of what you see during the Holocene. And as you go beyond, 2 degrees above, 3 degrees above, that\u2019s above what we\u2019ve seen at the Holocene,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a message I would agree with, and it makes sense given the data.\u201d But BIOME4, the model used, did have some limits. Specifically, it doesn\u2019t examine changes to the environment within biomes\u2014such as whether deciduous forests, while remaining deciduous, could become drier or host a different mix of species. Forests don't have to become desert to fundamentally change\u2014new blights, rain patterns, and invasive species can devastate them, leaving the same forest with many new trees. These more difficult modeling problems are some of the challenges researchers will face as they try to understand the benefits of the 1.5-degree goal\u2014before it becomes impossible.","headline":"The Sahara Could Advance Into Spain","article_name":505760.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-next-century-will-change-europes-climate-more-than-the-past-10000-years-did\/505760\/","date_published":"2016-11-01 13:45:09","article_length":5209,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:20.483203","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/11\/the-next-century-will-change-europes-climate-more-than-the-past-10000-years-did\/505760\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Hurricane Ian shows some symptoms of global warming. But saying anything beyond that is folly. Hurricane Ian is one of the most destructive hurricanes ever to hit Florida. A day after the storm made landfall, hundreds of people have been rescued and, as of this morning, millions were without power. President Joe Biden has indicated that early reports suggest \u201csubstantial loss of life,\u201d but no firm numbers have been confirmed. With such a catastrophic storm coming after the string of disasters this summer, some commentators have tried to link Hurricane Ian to climate change. But while climate change is clearly fueling some disasters, such as heat waves and wildfires, it has a more complicated effect on hurricanes. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations\u2013led panel of hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, has said that it\u2019s an \u201cestablished fact\u201d that industrial carbon pollution has led to an increase in \u201cfrequency\u201d or \u201cintensity\u201d of extreme weather. But the report uses more circumspect language such as \u201clikely\u201d to talk about tropical cyclones. (Tropical cyclones are only called hurricanes when they\u2019re above a certain wind speed and in the Atlantic or North Pacific Ocean.) Climate change is changing hurricanes in a few ways. \u201cFirst of all, you can have more intense hurricanes in a warmer climate. That finding goes back well over 30 years now,\u201d Kerry Emanuel , an MIT meteorologist and an expert on how climate change affects hurricanes, told me. \u201cFor that reason we expect to see more of the highest-category storms\u2014the Cat 3s, Cat 4s, Cat 5s, more of the Ian-style storms.\u201d Read: How Hurricane Irma is sucking Florida\u2019s beaches dry In effect, climate change raises the speed limit on storms, he said, allowing hurricanes to attain a higher wind speed than they would otherwise. Why does this happen? It arises from the brute-force physics of a hurricane colliding with the inescapable presence of greenhouse gases. \u201cA hurricane is a heat engine,\u201d Emanuel told me, turning heat from the ocean into wind energy. This transformation happens because as water evaporates from the sea surface, it transfers heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, essentially speeding the storm. (The underlying phenomenon here is also why \u201cif you\u2019re wet, you feel cold, all else being equal,\u201d Emanuel said.) So how does the ocean get hot in the first place? There is really only one way for heat to enter the ocean and only two ways for it to leave, he said. Heat always arrives in the ocean as sunlight; it always leaves as infrared radiation, which is emitted back into space, or as evaporation from the sea surface. But carbon dioxide and other climate pollutants prevent infrared radiation from escaping the ocean\u2014that\u2019s the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d that gives greenhouse gases their name. Because heat has nowhere else to go, the rate of sea-surface evaporation has to speed up, which means more heat energy can pass into the storm. In other words, climate change \u201ccreates the conditions for water to evaporate faster,\u201d Emanuel said, which means more heat can enter a given storm\u2014and it can get windier. Second, researchers agree that hurricanes can now strengthen far faster than they could in the old climate. The number of tropical cyclones that have undergone \u201crapid intensification\u201d\u2014a term of art meaning a storm\u2019s top wind speed has increased by at least 35 miles per hour over a 24-hour period \u2014has \u201clikely\u201d risen over the past 40 years, the IPCC has found. \u201cThe forecaster\u2019s nightmare is going to bed with a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico and waking up to a Cat 4 bearing down on a city\u201d that has no time to evacuate, he told me. Even when meteorologists can safely predict that a storm will rapidly intensify, they can struggle to communicate its risks to the public. Hurricane Ian looks like a textbook case of rapid intensification : On Monday morning, its top wind speeds were 75 miles per hour, barely qualifying the storm as a hurricane; just 48 hours later, its winds howled at up to 155 miles per hour\u2014 just shy of Category 5 status \u2014as it made landfall in Cayo Costa, Florida. Indeed, people may feel like every hurricane to hit the United States recently has undergone a similar metamorphosis. Last year, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a powerful Category 4 storm only 74 hours after it became a tropical depression; the storm formed and came ashore faster than New Orleans could evacuate. In 2018, Hurricane Michael rapidly exploded into Category 4 status before it walloped the Florida Panhandle; a year earlier, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma also experienced rapid intensification before they made landfall. Finally, climate change is making hurricanes rainier, Emanuel said. That\u2019s actually true of most storms, tropical or not, but it\u2019s especially important for hurricanes, because rain from a given hurricane can combine with other impacts to increase a storm\u2019s overall danger. Read: Did climate change intensify Hurricane Harvey? \u201cIf you have a more intense storm and an elevated sea level, you\u2019re going to be more susceptible to surge flooding,\u201d when the storm pushes the ocean ashore, he told me. Then, surge flooding and \u201cfreshwater flooding\u201d from all that extra rain \u201ccan gang up,\u201d he said, creating a brackish flooding disaster. \u201cIt looks like that\u2019s what happened in Fort Myers,\u201d which has seen some of the worst damage, he told me. So that\u2019s what scientists do know about climate change and hurricanes. But much remains unclear or unknown about how the two interact. There\u2019s essentially no agreement on what a warming climate will do to smaller hurricanes in the Category 1 or 2 range, Emanuel said. Historically, these less intense storms form far more often than major storms, and they dominate the raw numbers of hurricanes that form each year (although major hurricanes still cause by far the most damage). But \u201cwe just don\u2019t know if the number of those smaller storms will be more or fewer or stay the same.\u201d Climatologists also don\u2019t know what will happen to the diameter of hurricanes. The size of hurricanes is an overlooked but important aspect of a storm\u2019s danger, Emanuel said. For instance, Hurricane Ian made landfall in almost the same place that Hurricane Charley did in 2004 , but Ian is a much wider\u2014and thus a much more destructive\u2014storm. Charley, in fact, could almost fit entirely within Ian\u2019s eye . Idealized computer models show that climate change will likely make these monster storms more common, Emanuel said, but so far \u201cnobody wants to carry that over to the real world,\u201d which is far more complex than a simulation. So what can we say about climate change\u2019s effect on Ian? Stepping back, it seems safe to say that it showed some symptoms of climate change. It rapidly intensified. It dumped huge amounts of rain. You could even argue that it showed evidence of that \u201chigher speed limit.\u201d But asking questions beyond that is folly, Emanuel said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the question \u2018How did climate change affect this storm?\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you had a grandparent who died of lung cancer and who smoked two packs a day, you wouldn\u2019t ask, \u2018How much did smoking contribute to his lung cancer?\u2019 Because sometimes people get lung cancer without smoking at all. You just can\u2019t answer that question.\u201d","headline":"Honestly?

{"id":null,"body":"A person fretting about a \u201cscorching\u201d day might find the same temperature unremarkable within five years, a new study finds. In the past 50 years, climate change has altered the weather of the United States, leading to milder winters, warmer nights, and sweltering summer heat waves. These changes will intensify in the decades to come; by the end of the century, for instance, Philadelphia could feel a lot like Memphis . But a new study suggests that most Americans have not noticed these changes\u2014and they never will. For the past decade or so, different teams of social scientists have tried to answer the same question: Where does our sense of \u201cnormal\u201d weather come from? Why do some days feel unusually hot, and some only normally hot? Were I to compare thee to a summer\u2019s day, would I be thinking of a lifetime of summer days , the past few decades of summer days , or just some pictures of summer that I saw once in a book? The new study, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , tries to answer this question by looking at Twitter data. Is the weather ever so unusual, the authors asked, that people tweet more about it? To find out, they matched a database of 2.1 billion geotagged tweets with another database of geotagged weather conditions. Then they filtered the tweets for weather-specific words, such as drizzly , scorching , and autumnal. Americans\u2019 sense of \u201cnormal\u201d weather seems to reset about every five years, they found. People sent more weather tweets when it was unusually hot or cold outside, but their sense of what made for \u201cunusual\u201d weather was fairly shortsighted. Generally, if people had experienced an extreme temperature in the same month over the previous two to eight years, they were much less likely to tweet about it. Read: The East Coast is going to get Arkansas-ified This is a challenging finding for many climate advocates, because it suggests that people update their sense of normal weather faster than climate change will occur. In other words, many Americans will simply never detect that anything has gone wrong with the weather, at least on a day-to-day basis. As Frances Moore, an author of the paper and an environmental science and policy professor at UC Davis, told me: \u201cWe can\u2019t just expect people to walk outside and realize climate change is happening.\u201d In their data, Moore and her colleagues found that Twitter users updated their sense of cold weather just as quickly as they did hot weather. So users would sometimes complain about a seemingly frigid week in midwinter, even though outdoor temperatures were \u201cnot actually that cold in historical context,\u201d\u2019 she said. \u201cIt just felt cold because people\u2019s idea of normal winter temperatures has changed.\u201d Earth\u2019s Temperatures Will Rise\u2014But We Might Not Notice The study tells a larger story about climate change, one that I can recognize in my own experience. It suggests that global warming won\u2019t feel as if someone is raising the atmosphere to a broil. Instead, it will feel as if we\u2019re all ascending an endless staircase, without really knowing how high we\u2019ve climbed. Every few years, people might remark about a dangerously hot summer or a worryingly warm winter. But after those temperatures come back a few times, we\u2019ll stop noticing them. We\u2019ll forget that the seasons were once different than they are now. And the cycle of extremes will start over again. Read: So is it spring yet? Yet the study can only really gesture at this idea, however compelling it might be. Aaron McCright , a sociology professor at Michigan State University who has studied public understanding of climate change, told me he is uncomfortable analyzing Twitter data to measure changing attitudes. Ultimately, only a computer program is up to the task of analyzing 2.1 billion tweets\u2014and even then, computer programs make basic mistakes, get confused, and don\u2019t recognize sarcasm. Even though humans double-checked a small sample of that program\u2019s work, they can never clear the entire data set. The study ignores other important questions, too. \u201cYou really want to try to account for the length of time a person has lived in an area when you are asking them to evaluate some weather as normal or abnormal,\u201d McCright said in an email. But the study doesn\u2019t do that. It also doesn\u2019t account for how much any one heat wave or cold snap was covered by the press, which could shape how often people tweeted about it. \u201cThink about the polar-vortex wobble a few weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, most in the U.S. experienced much colder temperatures than normal. But we were heavily bombarded with major news stories before, during, and after the event telling us just how extreme the weather was.\u201d Finally, because only a fraction of Americans use Twitter, the study\u2019s sample likely does not represent the U.S. population as a whole. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what to make of this study,\u201d he said. Read: The three most chilling conclusions from the climate report Even the study recognizes some of these gaps. Moore stressed that the study does not examine perception of high-profile natural disasters, such as floods, wildfires, or hurricanes. Yet evidence suggests that Americans still take heed of those events. Last month, an AP poll found that \u201crecent extreme weather events\u201d are the main reason that Americans are coming to accept climate change. For Alexa Spence , a psychology professor at the University of Nottingham, the study offers helpful lessons for scientists, the press, and anyone hoping to talk persuasively about climate change. \u201cWe should be making sure that \u2026 historical comparisons are selected appropriately\u201d she said, so that we can properly appreciate today\u2019s weather in its \u201cfull alarming enormity.\u201d After all, most of our weather has been unprecedented lately. We have just lived through the four hottest years ever measured . But what did winter bring back in 2014? How sweltering was that summer? A few years can be enough time to forget whatever felt different.","headline":"Why Americans Might Never Notice Climate Change\u2019s Hotter Weather","article_name":583570.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/its-getting-warmer-but-americans-may-never-notice-climate-change\/583570\/","date_published":"2019-03-01 15:43:12","article_length":6000,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:21.270729","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/its-getting-warmer-but-americans-may-never-notice-climate-change\/583570\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Nuclear power might be part of a Green New Deal, but it can\u2019t meet all U.S. energy needs. When the fate of the planet is at stake, a single precedent starts to seem like a blueprint. Most Americans, as far as pollsters can tell, want the United States to honor its commitment under the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to that pact, the United States must, by 2025, cut its carbon emissions 26 percent below their all-time peak. That will be hard. To make the Paris goal, the U.S. would have to cut carbon by 2.6 percent every year for the next seven years. And it has simply never cut its emissions that fast in such a sustained way before. In fact, since the end of World War II, only one country has pulled off such a feat: France. Starting in 1974, France undertook an extensive build-out of its nuclear-power industry, and slashed its carbon emissions by an average rate of 2.9 percent every year from 1979 to 1988, while still growing its economy. No country has done anything like that before or since. It has the promise of a good strategy. And last week, it\u2019s just what the center-right commentator Andrew Sullivan ordered. Writing in New York , Sullivan argued that the United States should undertake \u201ca massive nuclear energy program\u201d as a \u201cradically moderate answer to climate change.\u201d Unlike renewables, nuclear power doesn\u2019t cease to work when the sun sets or when the wind stops blowing. It is already technologically feasible, and it\u2019s been quickly scaled up in the past. The ambition of a nuclear expansion could match that of the Green New Deal, except with all the twiddly socialism bits removed. To his credit, Sullivan\u2019s case for nuclear power includes long lists of its drawbacks. New nuclear plants are very expensive to build. Nuclear accidents, while extremely rare, are extremely expensive to remediate (if they can be remediated at all). But because the well-being of humanity is in jeopardy, these cons should bow to the pros, Sullivan says. After all, he asserts, nuclear power \u201ccan potentially meet all our energy demands.\u201d Isn\u2019t it nice to think so? Sullivan\u2019s sincere concern for the issue is welcome, and he is right to compliment the no-half-measures aspiration of the Green New Deal. He is also correct to argue that a nuclear build-out could lower the United States\u2019 carbon emissions. But, alas, nuclear power is not a full answer\u2014or even half an answer\u2014to climate change. It simply cannot meet all of the U.S.\u2019s energy demands. And by casting a nuclear build-out as a kind of moderate climate counteroffer, he reveals a misunderstanding about the Green New Deal itself\u2014and what makes it notable. Let there be no mistake: Nuclear power plants can generate enormous amounts of carbon-free electricity. A rapid increase in nuclear energy would slash emissions from the power sector, as the French example makes clear. Even today, France\u2019s carbon density\u2014its carbon emissions per capita\u2014ranks well below that of Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, according to the Global Carbon Atlas . But you can\u2019t put a nuclear reactor in a tractor-trailer or a steel plant. Nuclear can only reduce emissions from the power sector, and \u201cthe energy system is bigger than just electricity,\u201d says Sam Ori , the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. \u201cWhile I think nuclear has real potential as a means to decarbonizing electricity, you still have a lot of sectors to worry about.\u201d In fact, electricity makes up a smaller and smaller part of the climate problem. Right now, the power sector contributes only about a third of annual U.S. carbon emissions related to energy production. When you factor in land change and agriculture (read: deforestation and all those pesky cows), electricity is responsible for only about a quarter of annual U.S. emissions. And its share is declining. Carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector have fallen 28 percent since 2005 . Meanwhile, emissions from other parts of the economy\u2014transportation, agriculture, industry\u2014have fallen by only 5 percent. \u201cEven if you figure out electricity, you still have to figure out industry. You still have to figure out transportation,\u201d Ori told me. Although we have partial answers to some of the problems posed by those sectors\u2014everyone could buy electric cars, for instance, and charge them off the new nuclear-powered grid\u2014we don\u2019t have total ones. We still have no electrified way of moving around freight. Electrified air travel remains notional . All the nuclear plants in the world could not reduce the importance of oil in steel production . Solving all these problems will require some kind of public policy, Ori said; even electric cars won\u2019t replace their gas-powered brethren without a regulatory nudge. Sullivan\u2019s nuclear build-out has nothing to say about such challenges. Yet a Green New Deal does. If you look at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s actual Green New Deal resolution , you\u2019ll see that its vision extends far beyond the power sector. It pledges to invest in U.S. industry and manufacturing so as to remove \u201cpollution and greenhouse gas emissions \u2026 as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d It makes an almost identical promise for the agricultural sector. The resolution is notably imprecise in how it will accomplish those goals, but it was written as a list of goals , not policies. At least it recognizes that those sectors exist. ( The Washington Post editorial board\u2019s \u201cefficient, effective, and focused\u201d Green New Deal also makes passing mention of them.) So why does Sullivan believe that nuclear power constitutes a \u201cradically moderate\u201d counteroffer? I suspect he believes that it represents a concession on the part of environmentalists. For years, \u201cNo nukes\u201d was the unifying demand of Big Green groups. In his piece, Sullivan claims that \u201cnuclear power was left out entirely\u201d from the Green New Deal, which he calls \u201cstaggering.\u201d He links to a Popular Mechanics article that says the same thing. The problem is that it was included in the Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal demands 100 percent \u201cclean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\u201d The watchwords here are clean and zero-emission , both coded language for nuclear power. I have covered debates over nuclear\u2019s inclusion in the Green New Deal, and I agree that its status is shaky: The activist group Sunrise Movement has sometimes decried it and sometimes endorsed it. But the most detailed version of a Green New Deal online , from the leftist group Data for Progress, recognizes the importance of \u201cclean sources such as nuclear.\u201d And the author of that report told me explicitly on Twitter : \u201cI support more nuclear.\u201d The fact is that many environmentalists have already made the concession to nuclear power that Sullivan demands, precisely because they believe that climate change is so dangerous as to be worth the trade-offs. And because many environmentalists are also progressives, they might also recognize the big-government allure of nuclear power. \u201cIt is interesting to me that conservatives flock to nuclear power. They point to France! I can\u2019t get over that,\u201d Ori told me last week, sounding bewildered. \u201cIt\u2019s a state-run industry in France. The way they were able to get to 80 or 90 percent nuclear is that they didn\u2019t worry about market forces. They just did it.\u201d It was, in other words, industrial policy . So even if Sullivan misses the mark, the larger irony shouldn\u2019t be lost. Once, the environmental movement rallied under the banner of \u201cNo nukes.\u201d Now, in its hunt for precedents for the Green New Deal, it must admire Gallic nuclear appeal.","headline":"There Really, Really Isn\u2019t a Silver Bullet for Climate Change","article_name":584059.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/why-nuclear-power-cannot-solve-climate-change-alone\/584059\/","date_published":"2019-03-05 12:00:00","article_length":7638,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:21.825361","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/03\/why-nuclear-power-cannot-solve-climate-change-alone\/584059\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Lizards\u2019 feet are morphing, squid are shrinking, rats\u2019 teeth are getting shorter. What\u2019s in store for us? I n June of this year, not long before the midwinter solstice, catastrophic floodwaters draining from the Gippsland Plain, in southeastern Australia, left in their wake an otherworldly phenomenon: Translucent spider silk, extending half a mile in some places, trailed over riverbanks, roadsides, and fields, rising into glistening spires atop highway signs and shrubbery. On once-humdrum stretches of road, drivers pulled over to stare, take pictures . When a breeze ran through the membrane, it rippled with the fluency of a tide surging in a mangrove swamp. Light trembled on the sodden turf beneath. How improbable that something so delicate, sensuous even, might remain after something so destructive. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. To spot the creatures responsible, you would have had to draw close. Sheetweb spiders\u2014constellations of them\u2014clustered in a cosmos of their own froth and protein. A mature sheetweb is rarely bigger than a contact lens; the spiderlings are best made out with a magnifying glass. On days of ordinary weather, millions live in the earth, but when threatened by inundation, the spiders abandon their belowground niches. Each fashions a single thread, a streamer, to function as an emergency airlift. Lofted up by atmospheric currents, and possibly by electrostatic crackle too , the spiders sail on the tips of their lines toward higher terrain, alighting, in time, on fence posts or treetops or ascending farther still. In 2011, a pilot reported crossing paths with clumps of spiders at 2,000 feet . In a departure from habit\u2014wingless as they are\u2014the sheetwebs fly. The tracers of their mass decampment, a strand of silk for every spider, settle on a scale so vast, so uniform , the result looks less like the work of animals than like something mythological or architectural: a mysterious Christo at work, festooning the landscape . See: Photos of spiders that fled Australian flood The weather in Gippsland is changing, as is true everywhere. The variability of the region\u2019s climatic extremes has become more pronounced since the 1960s: hotter hot spells, fiercer floods. Scientists foresee longer dry periods split by downpours of worsening severity. When sheetwebs appear, we would do well to view them as a premonition of a future we are failing to avert. That which elevates the spiders out of crisis\u2014their ribbons of silk\u2014attests to how deeply they are, in fact, enmeshed in a nature that grows more chaotic. Weaving is the way arachnids make themselves at home in the world, their webs functioning as dormitories, trip wires, and traps for prey. But as the sheetwebs spin silk to flee an inhospitable habitat, their webs are flotsam from an evacuation. Though evolution has endowed these tiny asterisks of life with a flight instinct, and an ingenious strategy for extricating themselves from disaster, the spiders cannot stay aloft forever. When the sheetwebs drifted back down in Gippsland, that was not the end of their emergency. Not until after the waterlogged soil dried out did they shrink once more into their myriad hideaways. In countryside mauled by storms, with land submerged below rising rivers, we will see more of the spiders, it seems, for they cannot escape us. And should waters recede too slowly, they may be doomed. If we can set aside our anxious wonder, perhaps we may see in the sheetwebs\u2019 adaptive resources, and their limits, the challenges that await in the quest to acclimate to crisis. H ow to inhabit a world in profound transformation? In this era of climate-change anguish, all field biology might be said to be underpinned by that question. The answers emerging from studies of the animal kingdom shed light not only on the capacity of individual species to accommodate less favorable conditions, but on the guide rails that will govern whether, and how, every life form on the planet will be remade as the coming decades unfold. Conservation movements have historically coalesced around vanishing animals (whether African elephants, Bengal tigers, or monarch butterflies), but a significant line of research in the natural sciences has pursued a different concern: What must animals do now to persist? Two new books on this subject\u2014 Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid , by Thor Hanson , an independent conservation biologist, and A Natural History of the Future , by Rob Dunn , an ecologist at North Carolina State University\u2014explore the startling ways in which, short of extinction, fauna (and flora) are responding to cascading changes wrought, in varying degrees, by humankind. They direct their attention not to large mammals imperiled by dwindling wilderness, but to an assortment of minifauna: reptiles, fish, birds, insects, and even\u2014particularly in Dunn\u2019s writing\u2014microbes. Synthesizing a wealth of recent findings, both books open trapdoors onto the vivid lives of other beings in hopes of giving humans a close-grained understanding of our role in habitat change and the varieties of adaptation that may be in store for our species too. Hanson\u2019s subtitle, The Fraught and Fascinating Biology of Climate Change , clues us in to the author\u2019s goal of spotlighting strategies that permit animals to withstand (perhaps even to exploit) environments in transition. Right away he makes clear that vulnerabilities to change are not evenly distributed: Miseries hovering on the horizon for our species have already arrived for creatures that are susceptible to finer fluctuations of conditions, or that have lower thresholds of tolerance. Yet animals are not all equally entrenched in their existing habits and habitats. Some demonstrate surprising plasticity of behavior, geographic range, and even appearance. A remarkable few have evolved resilience in the face of disasters that human communities already experience as ruinous. Conditions don\u2019t have to be lethal, Hanson notes, to be consequential. To a sun-basking reptile\u2014a \u201cheliotherm\u201d that regulates its internal temperature by scampering in and out of the shade\u2014high heat is an acute stressor. Hotter weather hasn\u2019t killed fence lizards outright, but when these wriggly reptiles are forced to shelter for almost four daylight hours or longer, they hunt fewer insects, consume fewer calories, and cease reproducing, so their populations wink out all the same. Other lizard species have demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to expand the breadth of the extremes they can inhabit by revamping their bodies. For anole lizards living on the Turks and Caicos Islands, in the Caribbean\u2014an archipelago wracked by ever more severe weather\u2014the solution to enduring hurricanes lay underfoot, literally. Researchers have documented lizards evolving heritably longer front limbs and larger toe pads on their forefeet, the better to grip onto anchor points when buffeted by gales that damage buildings, uproot trees, and fell electricity poles. The lizards have transmogrified \u2014engineers might say \u201cruggedized\u201d\u2014to hold their ground in a nature that is more capricious today than at any time in their past. Read: After last year\u2019s hurricanes, Caribbean lizards are better at holding on for dear life Our mental models of climate change portray the process as ambient and inanimate\u2014manifest in the air and ocean, in melting ice and multiplying dunes. By contrast, the anole lizards\u2019 story is disquieting in its intimacy. It suggests that the legacy of extreme weather is legible in the flesh too, that physical appendages can be recast by hurricanes, over generations. As human actions alter the atmosphere in ways that guarantee more frequent and severe windstorms, in some sense we could be said to have become indirectly responsible for what some animals are , their very shape. Call to mind the Platonic ideal of a lizard\u2014bony, bronze, and flick-tongued, on the sand of a deserted beach. Do we now have a hand, so to speak, in its feet? The climate has always driven evolution , of course. The surprise, Hanson points out, is how fast some animals are modified by their surroundings\u2014and in pulses of sudden, lasting change, not by increments. Speckled wood butterflies are developing stronger wing muscles as their borderlands in Scotland warm up and move northward, opening territory to those butterflies best able to cover the distance. Male collared flycatchers on Sweden\u2019s Gotland Island are becoming less ornamented as temperatures climb. Fluffy white forehead patches on the birds (a feature of courtship displays) have perhaps become too burdensome: Males with striking plumes get drawn into more confrontations with rivals, and in hotter weather that competition expends reserves of energy to their detriment. Male three-spined sticklebacks (fish) likewise have grown duller. A flush of bright scales, hitherto enticing to female sticklebacks, proves a fruitless adornment in waters clouded by algal blooms. In the soot-soiled cities of the Industrial Revolution, peppered moths famously evolved to be darker in color , less visible to birds that sought to eat them. When the air grew clearer, lighter moths prevailed again. Likewise today, where once-durable snowpack has become transient and patchy in Finland, a once predominantly gray species of owl trends toward brown plumage, better camouflage in a tawny domain. Air pollution is still at work here, though it is not smog that dims the owls. Carbon emissions beget snowmelt by way of milder winters. Between the natural selection of adaptive traits and the artificial selection of desirable characteristics (that is, animals domesticated by humans), genetic variation in the wild is today subject to the inducements and penalties introduced by manufactured conditions. Read: Scientists have uncovered a disturbing climate change precedent The effects are cumulative and disorienting. Familiar animals lose their familiarity to us. Visually striking animals decline in visibility. These examples augur a less colorful, less pattern-filled world to come. Some animals appear to vanish entirely, only\u2014as if in a fable\u2014to be rediscovered in miniature, having passed through the eye of a crisis. The Humboldt squid was thought to have departed, or died in, Mexico\u2019s Gulf of California after a hot streak in 2009\u201310. In fact, the squid remained profuse\u2014but they had downsized to a fraction of their former dimensions, living half as long on a different diet. Trawlers seldom caught them, because their lures were mismatched to the adapted cephalopods, and the squid had so radically changed in appearance that people didn\u2019t know how to see them anymore. When the lines were pulled up, crew members examining the catch classed what few Humboldts they handled either as unsalable juveniles or as species of littler squid. What else, by shape-shifting to keep pace with conditions that we helped alter, has escaped our notice? Rob Dunn steers our attention toward the biota under our noses as part of a broader project to explicate the circumstances that prompt new life forms, and adaptive behaviors, to appear. As his subtitle\u2014 What the Laws of Biology Tell Us About the Destiny of the Human Species \u2014signals, he\u2019s also interested in extrapolating to how we ourselves might adjust, to what kind of changed world. Dunn is focused on the \u201cspecies that live not in the green spaces but in gray ones\u201d\u2014species that cohabit in the built environment, populating our households, cities, nationwide infrastructure, feedlots, fields. \u201cMore than half the Earth is now covered by ecosystems we have created,\u201d Dunn writes. He reports that \u201chumans now eat half of all the net primary productivity,\u201d that last phrase denoting \u201cthe green life that grows.\u201d Taken together, these spaces, far from being devoid of fauna, represent an \u201cinadvertent ark,\u201d an \u201curban Galapagos\u201d where opportunistic animals shelter and flourish. Even as human activities, both direct and indirect, obliterate wilderness, they are having a different effect closer to home. We are expanding the refuge and range of the bedbug, housefly, centipede, rat, bat, pigeon, parrot, crow. German cockroaches in China, for instance, are believed to have ridden climate-controlled trains through inhospitable (to them) territory and colonized far-flung buildings. Scientists monitoring urban wildlife point out that built-up areas also provide cover to larger numbers of vulnerable species than we might imagine: A 2015 study showed that Australian cities contain substantially more threatened species, per square kilometer, than nonurban areas do. Certain kinds of tortoise and orchid survive now only within city limits. Meanwhile, pockets of acorn ants and water fleas have become more heat-tolerant living among us, potentially arming them to repopulate greener contexts as temperatures rise there. Most astounding, as Dunn draws on several fascinating case studies to demonstrate, is that organisms, in evolving to leverage conditions and resources in these manufactured settings, sometimes change so much that new species emerge. Grain silos have given rise to unique songbirds and beetles that prosper off a filched, high-starch diet. Brown rats in some cities\u2014gird yourself\u2014have begun to form insular populations. In New Orleans, waterways divide colonies of rats. In New York, rats seem reluctant to pass through Midtown Manhattan\u2014perhaps because they find less to eat there. And the city\u2019s rats have developed distinctive features: They have longer noses and shorter teeth than elsewhere, possibly thanks to a diet of softer food. As rats in these subgroups cease interbreeding, sequestering novelty into distinct gene pools, they are more likely to speciate into new kinds of rat, the way house mice did upon reaching new continents. Among low-mobility organisms, those rooted in place or slow-moving, some can begin to fork into separate species within a surprisingly small domain. \u201cThe minimum area for a snail to evolve a new species is tiny\u2014less than a square kilometer,\u201d Dunn observes, \u201croughly the size of Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, California.\u201d As more and more of the globe is renovated to meet our needs, chances are that our homelands are where we can expect rodents, mollusks, insects, and some birds to evolve anew. Indeed, for all we know, unnamed fungi, ants, spiders, and more already thrive within reach\u2014awaiting study. We have \u201csecreted a human age out of ourselves as spiders secrete their webs,\u201d the philosopher Fredric Jameson wrote, and \u201cit absorbs all the formerly natural elements in its habitat.\u201d In the less hospitable world we now face, we need to learn how to live with conditions approaching the outer edges of our tolerance. In six decades, 1.5 billion people will find themselves living beyond the bounds of what Rob Dunn calls \u201cthe human niche\u201d\u2014the footings on which large populations of humans can survive and prosper. And that\u2019s under a generous scenario in which greenhouse gases peak in 2050 and are then globally reined in. If business as usual prevails, the number left stranded rises to 3.5 billion people. In mapping guidelines for human responsiveness to crisis, Dunn is well aware that one principle is inescapable: anthropocentrism. But like so much else, perhaps that built-in bias of ours is adaptable. Close study of how animals are living with climate change reveals that humans are at the center of more things than we realize\u2014shaping the lives of many more species than those we love or regard as familiar. Yet the quest to understand the remarkably varied array of pressures and possibilities involved in that dynamic should help keep hubris in check. Though we are a species long wedded to assertions of control over nature, these books make glaringly clear that we are not in command of what we have set in motion. The biodiversity and versatility on display in the animal kingdom of which we are part have lots to teach us. To remain at home in the world, we too will need to change.

{"id":null,"body":"New research takes the deepest dive ever into historic climate records. Back in 1999 Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann released the climate change movement's most potent symbol: The \"hockey stick,\" a line graph of global temperature over the last 1,500 years that shows an unmistakable, massive uptick in the twentieth century when humans began to dump large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It's among the most compelling bits of proof out there that human beings are behind global warming, and as such has become a target on Mann's back for climate denialists looking to draw a bead on scientists. Now it's gotten a makeover: A study published in Science reconstructs global temperatures further back than ever before -- a full 11,300 years. The new analysis finds that the only problem with Mann's hockey stick was that its handle was about 9,000 years too short. To be clear, the study finds that temperatures in about a fifth of this historical period were higher than they are today. But the key, said lead author Shaun Marcott of Oregon State University, is that temperatures are shooting through the roof faster than we've ever seen. \"What we found is that temperatures increased in the last hundred years as much as they had cooled in the last six or seven thousand,\" he said. \"In other words, the rate of change is much greater than anything we've seen in the whole Holocene,\" referring to the current geologic time period, which began around 11,500 years ago. Previous historic climate reconstructions typically extended no further back than 2,000 years, roughly as far back as you can go by examining climate indicators from tree rings, as Mann did. To dig even deeper, Marcott's team looked at objects collected from more than 70 sites worldwide, primarily fossilized ocean shells that have been unearthed by oceanographers. Existing research has shown that certain chemical tracers in the shells link directly to temperature at the time they were created; by studying oxygen isotopes in the fossilized plankton shown below, for example, scientists can deduce that it formed its shell at a time when Greenland was fully without ice. Marcott's task was to compile enough such samples to represent the whole planet over his chosen timeframe. \"There's been a lot of work that's gone into the calibrations, so we can be dead certain [the shells] are recording the temperature we think they're recording,\" he said. Today's study should help debunk the common climate change denial argument that recent warming is simply part of a long-term natural trend. Indeed, Marcott says, the earth should be nearing the bottom of a several-thousand year cool-off (the end-point of the rainbow arc in (B) above), if natural factors like solar variability were the sole driving factors. Instead, temperatures are rising rapidly. Mann himself, who literally wrote the book on attacks on climate scientists, said in an email to Climate Desk that he was \"certain that professional climate change deniers will attack the study and the authors, in an effort to discredit this important work,\" especially given the close ties between the two scientists' research. \"It will therefore be looked at as a threat to vested interests who continue to deny that human-changed climate change is a reality.\" Marcott admitted he was apprehensive about charging into the fully-mobilized troll army, but said he was grateful scientists like Mann had \"gone through hell\" before him to build a support network for harassed climate scientists. \"When Michael came along there was a lot more skepticism about global warming, but the public has come a long way,\" he said. \"I'm curious to see how the skeptics are going to take this paper.\"","headline":"We're Screwed: 11,000 Years' Worth of Climate Data Prove It","article_name":273870.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/03\/were-screwed-11-000-years-worth-of-climate-data-prove-it\/273870\/","date_published":"2013-03-09 12:57:37","article_length":3733,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:22.865557","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/03\/were-screwed-11-000-years-worth-of-climate-data-prove-it\/273870\/","source":"atlantic"}

The Rio+20 UN summit is just around the corner, the latest in a decades-long string of international meetings that attempt to address one of the world's greatest and most global environmental problems. What's that? Your eyes have already glazed over? Well, you're not alone. I just spent the last couple of days in Seoul for the Global Green Growth Institute Summit , where I spoke during a session on green journalism. A common refrain from both the speakers and the audience was that that people were tired of hearing the same jeremiads about greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, and government panels. Even people who care deeply about the environment are fatigued. This is a particularly acute problem on the Internet where the distribution of a story largely depends on readers to share the narrative with their friends through social media. The standard climate change narratives are not shareable. But to me the most interesting stories to tell about climate change have never been attempts to elucidate the worst-case scenarios. As an organizing narrative, what climate change offered me was a reason to rediscover and reimagine the world's basic infrastructure. Want to radically improve the efficiency of the transportation system? Well, first you have to understand how and why Americans built the system that we have. You have to ask: What problems were our forebears trying to solve? For people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, this is a fascinating topic because we came into a world that had effectively covered its tracks. By the logic of the system, making the industrial processes that power the world opaque was good, so we don't see them in our daily lives. As an early 21 st century American, it is easy to be completely ignorant of the basic systems -- food, water, energy -- that make modern life possible. You just don't have to know. I think there's a perception that people don't want to read stories about the innards of industrial life, but I've never had a hard time getting people to look at and share these narratives. Take a look at Reddit's Today I Learned section. Among the miscellany, you often find factlets about how the 20 th century's big technological systems work.\u00a0 Which makes sense because there is just so much to know about the complex networks that deliver what we need. When you really think about everything that needs to happen for a piece of coal in Wyoming to become the electricity that flows into your phone, it's stunning. It doesn't make me mad or depressed, even though burning the coal emits carbon. Rather, I'm filled with awe about the achievements of previous generations, and maybe with some hope that our generation can accomplish something equally ambitious.","headline":"What's Actually Interesting About Covering Climate Change","article_name":257091.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/05\/whats-actually-interesting-about-covering-climate-change\/257091\/","date_published":"2012-05-11 21:39:08","article_length":2853,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:22.903203","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/05\/whats-actually-interesting-about-covering-climate-change\/257091\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Seaweed farms have the capacity to grow huge amounts of nutrient-rich food, and oysters can act as an efficient carbon and nitrogen sink For decades environmentalists have fought to save our oceans from the perils of overfishing, climate change, and pollution. All noble efforts -- but what if environmentalists have it backwards? What if the question is not how to save the oceans, but how the oceans can save us? That is what a growing network of scientists, ocean farmers, and environmentalists around the world is trying to figure out. With nearly 90 percent of large fish stocks threatened by over-fishing and 3.5 billion people dependent on the seas as their primary food source, these ocean farming advocates have concluded that aquaculture is here to stay. But rather than monolithic factory fish farms, they see the oceans as the home of small-scale farms where complementary species are cultivated to provide food and fuel -- and to clean up the environment and fight climate change. Governed by an ethic of sustainability, they are re-imagining our oceans with the hope of saving us from the grip of the ever-escalating climate, energy, and food crises. The Death and Rebirth of the Ocean Farm Ocean farming is not a modern innovation. For thousands of years cultures as diverse as the ancient Egyptians, Romans, Aztecs, and Chinese have farmed finfish, shellfish, and aquatic plants. Atlantic salmon have been farmed in Scotland since the early 1600s; seaweed was a staple food for American settlers. Unfortunately, what was once a sustainable fishery has been modernized into large-scale industrial-style farming. Modeled on land-based factory livestock farms, aquaculture operations are infamous for their low-quality, tasteless fish pumped full of antibiotics and polluting local waterways. According to a recent New York Times  editorial , aquaculture \"has repeated too many of the mistakes of industrial farming -- including the shrinking of genetic diversity, a disregard for conservation, and the global spread of intensive farming methods before their consequences are completely understood.\" Unsurprisingly, once information got out among the general public, \"aquaculture\" quickly became a dirty word. Industry responded with a strategy of mislabeling seafood and upping their marketing budgets, rather than investing in more sustainable and environmentally benign farming techniques. But a small group of ocean farmers and scientists decided to chart a different course. Rather than relying on mono-aquaculture operations, these new ocean farms are pioneering muti-tropic and sea-vegetable aquaculture, whereby ocean farmers grow abundant, high-quality seafood while improving, rather than damaging, the environment. One example is Ocean Approved in Maine, which cultivates seaweed that doubles as a nutrient-rich food source and a sponge for organic pollutants. Farmers in Long Island Sound are exploring diversifying small-scale organic shellfish farms with various species of seaweed to filter out the pollutants, mitigate oxygen depletion, and develop a sustainable source for fertilizer and fish meal. In southern Spain Veta La Palma designed its farm to restore wetlands, and in the process created the largest bird sanctuary in Spain, with over 220 species of birds. Seaweed farms alone have the capacity to grow massive amounts of nutrient-rich food. Professor Ronald Osinga at Wageningen University in the Netherlands has calculated that a global network of \"sea-vegetable\" farms totaling 180,000 square kilometers -- roughly the size of Washington state -- could provide enough protein for the entire world population. The goal, according to chef Dan Barber -- named one of the world's most influential people by Time and a hero of the organic food movement -- is to create a world where \"farms restore instead of deplete\" and allow \"every community to feed itself.\" But here is the real kicker: Because they require no fresh water, no deforestation, and no fertilizer -- all significant downsides to land-based farming -- these ocean farms promise to be more sustainable than even the most environmentally-sensitive traditional farms. Ramping up food production without increasing greenhouse gas emissions is vital if we are to survive the coming decades. But land-based food production is entering an era of crisis. The U.N. estimates that global grain production will plummet by 63 million metric tons this year alone mainly because of weather-related calamities like the Russian heat wave and the floods in Pakistan. Bun Lai , world-renowned sustainable seafood chef, believes that: If done right, this new generation of green aquaculture is poised to become the most sustainable form of farming on the planet. We need healthy food that protects rather than harms our climate and Earth. It is a key piece of the puzzle for building a sustainable future. Nature's Climate Warriors: Seaweed and Shellfish Rather than finfish, the anchor crops of the emerging green ocean farms are seaweed and shellfish -- two gifted organisms that might well be mother nature's secret weapons to fight climate change. Considered the \"tree\" of coastal ecosystems, seaweed uses photosynthesis to pull massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere -- with some varieties capable of absorbing five times more carbon dioxide than land-based plants. Seaweed is one of the fastest growing plants in the world; kelp, for example, grows up to 9-12 feet long in a mere three months. This turbo-charged growth cycle enables farmers to scale up their carbon sinks quickly. Of course, the seaweed grown to mitigate emissions would need to be harvested to produce carbon-neutral biofuels to ensure that the carbon is not simply recycled back into the air as it would be if the seaweed is eaten. The Philippines, China, and other Asian countries, which have long farmed seaweed as a staple food source, now view seaweed farms as an essential ingredient for reducing their carbon emissions. Oysters also absorb carbon, but their real talent is filtering nitrogen out of the water column. Nitrogen is the greenhouse gas you don't pay attention to -- it is nearly 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and according to the journal Nature , the second worst in terms of having already exceeded a maximum \" planetary boundary .\" Like carbon, nitrogen is an essential part of life -- plants, animals, and bacteria all need it to survive -- but too much has a devastating effect on our land and ocean ecosystems. The main nitrogen polluter is agricultural fertilizer runoff. All told, the production of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides contributes more than one trillion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere globally each year. That's the same amount of emissions that are generated by 88 million passenger cars each year. Much of this nitrogen from fertilizers ends up in our oceans, where nitrogen is now 50 percent above normal levels. According to the journal Science , excess nitrogen \"depletes essential oxygen levels in the water and has significant effects on climate, food production, and ecosystems all over the world.\" Oysters to the rescue. One oyster filters 30-50 gallons of water a day -- and in the process filters nitrogen out of the water column. Recent work done by Roger Newell of the University of Maryland shows that a healthy oyster habitat can reduce total added nitrogen by up to 20 percent. A three-acre oyster farm filters out the equivalent nitrogen load produced by 35 coastal inhabitants (PDF). There is an array of projects sprouting up that use a mix of seaweed and shellfish to clean up polluted urban waterways and help communities prepare for the effect of climate change. One initiative, spearheaded by Dr. Charles Yarish of the University of Connecticut, is growing kelp and shellfish on floating lines in New York's Bronx River to filter nitrogen, mercury, and other pollutants out of the city's toxic waterways, with the goal of making them healthier, more productive, and more economically viable. Then there is the emerging field of \"oyster-tecture,\" dedicated to building artificial oyster reefs and floating gardens to help protect coastal communities from future hurricanes, sea level rise, and storm surges. Architect Kate Orff from the design firm SCAPE is developing urban aquaculture parks that use floating rafts and suspended shellfish long-lines to build more urban green space while improving the environment. She envisions the new urban ocean farmer as part shell fisherman tending to oysters reefs, and part landscaper, tending the above-surface floating parks. In Connecticut, advocates are pushing for an expansion of the state's existing nitrogen credit trading program to include shellfish farms, thereby reimbursing oystermen for the nitrogen they filter from Long Island Sound each year. With new oyster operations sprouting up all around the country, rewarding \"green fishermen\" for the positive effect their farms have on the environment could be a model for how to stimulate job growth while saving the planet. Farm Your Fuel, Power the Planet Finding a clean replacement for existing biofuels is becoming increasingly urgent. A report commissioned by the European Union found biofuels from soy beans can create up to four times more climate-warming emissions than equivalent fossil fuels. Biofuels have also forced global food prices up by 75 percent -- far more than previously estimated -- according to a confidential World Bank study. And a recent report from the International Food Policy and Research Institute , warned that U.S. government support for corn ethanol was a major factor behind this year's food price spikes. Seaweed and other algae is increasingly looking like a viable substitute. About 50 percent of seaweed's weight is oil, which can be used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes. Scientists at the University of Indiana recently figured out how to turn seaweed into biodiesel four times faster than other biofuels, and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered a way to use alginate extracted from kelp to ramp up the storage power of lithium-ion batteries by a factor of ten. But unlike land-based biofuel crops, seaweed farming does not require fertilizers, forest clearing, water, or heavy use of fuel-burning machinery -- and, as a result, according to the World Bank, has a negative carbon footprint. While the technology is still in development, farmers are eager to begin growing their own fuel and create some of the first closed energy loop farms on the planet. The U.S. Navy has already developed the Riverine Combat ship and Seahawk helicopters powered by seaweed-based bio-diesel. The Pentagon views seaweed and other algae as a key component in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. According to Alan Shaffer , the Pentagon's principal deputy director of defense research and engineering: The beauty with algae is that you can grow it anywhere and to grow it needs to absorb carbon dioxide, so it's not only a very effective fuel, in theory it's also a carbon sink. That's a pretty good deal. The DOE estimates that seaweed biofuel can yield up to 30 times more energy per acre than land crops such as soybeana. According to Biofuels Digest , Given the high oil yield from algae, some 10 million acres would be sufficient ... to replace the total petro-diesel fuel in the United States today. This is about one percent of the total amount of acreage used in the United States today for grazing and farming. The world's energy needs could be met by setting aside three percent of the world's oceans for seaweed farming. \"I guess it's the equivalent of striking oil,\" says University of California, Berkeley microbial biology professor Tasios Melis . The Bitter Reality of Climate Change These are urgent times, demanding creative and bold solutions. In his best-selling book Eaarth: Making Life on a Tough New Planet , Bill McKibben breaks the news that climate change is no longer a future threat -- it is here and now and we had better get our affairs in order. Our oceans are already locked in a death spiral. According to the International Program on the State of the Ocean (IPSO) -- a consortium of 27 of the top ocean experts in the world -- the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, and oxygen depletion have already triggered a \"phase of extinction of marine species unprecedented in human history.\" Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are breaking records , exceeding even the worst-case scenario envisioned by scientists four years ago. We face a bitter new reality: Mitigating the effects of climate change may force us to develop our seas to save them -- and planet. This re-imaging of the oceans will be heart-wrenching and controversial. Our waters are revered as some of the last wild spaces on Earth -- ungoverned and untouched by human hands. If we develop our oceans, farms will some day dot coastlines, mirroring our agricultural landscape. But in the face of the escalating climate crisis, we have little choice but to explore new ways of sustaining humanity while protecting the planet. As we search for new solutions, we cannot afford to repeat the errors made on land, subsidizing industrial-scale factory farms at the expense of environmental and food quality. Simply substituting destructive fishing fleets with destructive fish farms will only hasten the demise of our oceans. Instead, we can learn from our mistakes and chart a new course guided by principles of sustainability and meeting social needs. This means dedicating portions of ocean to farming -- while reserving large swaths for marine conservation parks. And rather than building sprawling ocean factories, we need create decentralized networks of small-scale food and energy farms growing food, generating power, and creating jobs for local communities. While no panacea, ocean farming -- carefully conceived -- could be a vital part of reversing course and building a greener future. All of us who hold dear the deep blue sea need to confront the brutal reality that if we ignore the largest environmental crisis of our generation, our wild oceans will be dead oceans. Images: 1.

{"id":null,"body":"Over five decades, the GOP has transformed into something I no longer recognize. I have been immersed in national politics in Washington for five decades. Over my time here, as an academic, a congressional staffer, a think tanker, and a commentator and public figure, I have gotten to know and worked with a wide range of key actors in politics and policy. I have seen up close the changes in our politics and culture. Nothing has been more striking or significant than the transformation of the Republican Party, from a moderately conservative party to a very conservative party to something else entirely. One sign of this change? A five-term Republican congressman from Colorado, elected in the Tea Party wave in 2010 and now a Trump loyalist, was recently defeated in a primary by a candidate who runs Shooters Grill, where servers are encouraged to carry firearms, and who has indulged the QAnon conspiracy theories and who is now endorsed, not repudiated, by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Another? The current buzz surrounding Tucker Carlson as the party\u2019s hope in 2024\u2014even as he takes sudden leave from his show to go fishing, after one of his writers was tied to racist and misogynistic posts on an internet message board. Few of the dozens of Republicans in high office I have known and admired over five decades\u2014in a party not my own and holding views that, in many cases, I did not share\u2014would be represented in the Republican Party of today. While some of my friends and mentors were and are moderates, others were proud conservatives, who genuinely believed in fiscal discipline but also valued government, albeit in a limited form. But the radical and unconservative idea that all government should be disdained, that tax cuts that blow up the debt are just fine, would be anathema to them. Read: The November election is going to be a mess And the idea that the Republican Party would be a force for ethnic and anti-immigrant animus and racial division would appall them\u2014including my late friend Jack Kemp. The Republicans I knew best and worked most closely with were almost uniformly for civil rights\u2014they represented the party of Everett Dirksen and William McCullough, who were instrumental in passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The individuals I knew, admired, and worked with were not the entirety of the Republican Party, even then. Plenty of lawmakers and others were quite content to exploit racism. They sought out the votes of segregationist former Southern Democrats, such as Strom Thurmond, to refill their party\u2019s diminishing moderate ranks in the Northeast and the Midwest, and on the West Coast. Beginning with Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 candidacy and Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 \u201claw and order\u201d campaign, some Republican politicians ran for office using rhetoric that, at best, cynically inflamed racial divisions. But even as I opposed many of the initiatives and campaign tactics of that Republican Party, I appreciated its efforts to solve problems and work within the governing institutions. The party of Nixon, with all its pathologies, created the Environmental Protection Agency, proposed a health-care-reform plan as sweeping as the later Affordable Care Act, and considered offering Americans a guaranteed annual income on a par with Andrew Yang\u2019s universal basic income. The party of Reagan, which tried to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and which slashed taxes in 1981, precipitating ballooning deficits, also cut deals with Democratic Representative Henry Waxman to bolster Medicare and Medicaid; championed bipartisan Social Security reform in 1983; and supported tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 to offset the earlier cuts and reduce the deficits. The party responsible for Iran-Contra is also the party that championed democracy and moved in concert with Democrats to create the National Endowment for Democracy, the United States Institute of Peace, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. In 1976, I worked on a project to reorganize the Senate\u2019s committee system. The effort was led by Democratic Senator Adlai Stevenson III, but involved Republicans, including Bill Brock, Bob Packwood, and Pete Domenici. After a long day during which Domenici had worked nonstop on our committee, I asked the freshman senator why, with so many other assignments, he was giving so much to a panel whose rewards were limited. Any changes we made in committee numbers, assignments, and jurisdictions were sure to infuriate his colleagues. \u201cServing in the Senate is the greatest honor I can imagine,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am determined to leave it a better place than it was when I came in.\u201d Domenici, like many other Republicans of his generation, had a great amount of what scholars call \u201cinstitutional patriotism\u201d: a concern for the operation and integrity of Congress as an institution, and its relationship to the other branches. They cared about integrity in governance and personal rectitude. They believed in the independence of Congress and its need to provide a check and balance against corruption and maladministration in the executive branch, whether the president was from their own or the opposite party. Unfortunately, they were unable to transfer those values to succeeding generations, or to overcome the regional shift in American party politics, the rise of manipulative leaders, and the growing influence of extremist tribal media. Read: Larry Hogan isn\u2019t coming to save the Republican Party  The Republican Party\u2019s slide away from those values preceded Donald Trump, providing the conditions for his rise. In recent years, the GOP has thrown away its guiding values and embraced its darkest instincts. It has blown up long-standing norms in the Senate, creating divisions that outstrip anything I have seen before; done nothing about rank corruption in the White House and the Cabinet; accepted the politicization of the Justice Department and lies from the attorney general; avoided any meaningful oversight of misconduct; and failed to curb attacks on the independence of inspectors general. Read: Why Republicans still can\u2019t quit Trump The GOP now distinguishes itself by inaction. It has stood and watched as this administration separated children from their parents at the border, mistreated asylum seekers, botched its response to a hurricane in Puerto Rico, attacked science, and opened new avenues for toxic materials in our air and water. It said and did nothing about Russian interference in the 2016 elections, and is actively blocking efforts to combat a recurrence in 2020. It has refused to pass a new Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated the legislation, which, reflecting the GOP of the past, had passed the House unanimously. It has refused to deal in any fashion with urgent problems such as climate change, immigration, global competition, hunger, and poverty. It confirmed nominees who lied to the Senate, who inflated r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and who failed to meet minimum qualifications for the job. It confirmed judges who were unanimously rated unqualified by the American Bar Association. The party jammed through a tax cut at a time of low unemployment and low economic growth, making a mockery of modern economics and leaving little flexibility to deal with the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It slashed the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, delivering an 80 percent cut to global-health programs designed to fight pandemics, and leaving the agency without the resources necessary to battle COVID-19. It has said almost nothing about the pitiful and reckless responses of the president to the pandemic, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths that should never have occurred. And now it is silent as we learn that Russia offered bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers, while the president said and did nothing. I grew up in a family of Democrats. My maternal grandfather, who had emigrated from Russia to escape czarist pogroms, moved to Minneapolis and became a labor leader, a member of the small \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d that convinced Hubert Humphrey to enter politics and run for mayor of the city. My idols, growing up were giants of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, including Humphrey, Orville Freeman, Walter Mondale, Art Naftalin, and Donald Fraser. I was a young student at the University of Minnesota before I talked to a Republican at length. That\u2019s where I met Doug Head, the state attorney general. He was a thoughtful intellectual and, like the core of the Minnesota Republican Party, a moderate conservative, far more center than right. His emphasis on public service made a lasting impression, helping me understand that I could share a common commitment with people who disagreed with me on policy. I came to Washington in 1969 on a congressional fellowship. Although I was working for Don Fraser, William Steiger, a young Republican representative from Wisconsin, soon became another mentor. Steiger loved the House and the congressional-fellowship program, and opened his door to me regularly to come and talk about politics, governance, and careers. He seemed destined for a major leadership role, before he died of a heart ailment at 40. When I moved to the Senate for the second half of my fellowship in 1970, I was assigned to George McGovern. He had put together an informal committee to push for a vote to end the Vietnam War. I worked closely with Republicans, including Mark Hatfield, Charles Goodell, and Jacob Javits. The task was not easy for them\u2014after all, they were directly challenging President Nixon. The work was sometimes intense. I saw, up close, a bitter confrontation over Vietnam between McGovern and Bob Dole. But later, I would watch them develop a working relationship to combat hunger, and then forge a close friendship that lasted four decades, until McGovern\u2019s death. William J. Burns: Polarized politics has infected American diplomacy Plenty of the Republicans I dealt with in the past were fierce partisans, including Dole and John Rhodes. But when pushed, they put country first\u2014that was the basis on which they could forge bonds across the aisle. I had strong relationships in years past with a number of Republicans currently in the Senate. But none of them have, in recent years, behaved in a fashion that would meet the values of the party of Domenici, Steiger, or Dole. The country obviously needs a major change in its politics, a purging of the status quo. It faces challenges both societal and structural that go beyond Trump and the two parties. The United States must recover from the pandemic and rebuild its economy, while confronting head-on the issue of racism. But we cannot long operate as a democracy without two problem-solving parties that aim to compete for genuine majorities in the country. The Democratic Party is far from a paragon of virtue here; in politics, there are no angels. It faces its own deep challenges ahead. But America\u2019s crisis of governance has been driven by a party that my colleague Tom Mann and I, long before Trump, described as an insurgent outlier in American politics. \u201cIt is ideologically extreme,\u201d we wrote in 2012; \u201cscornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d I was reminded of that description recently by the comments of the Republican pollster Alex Castellanos. \u201cMask-wearing has become a totem, a secular religious symbol,\u201d Castellanos told  The Washington Post . \u201cChristians wear crosses, Muslims wear a hijab, and members of the Church of Secular Science bow to the Gods of Data by wearing a mask as their symbol, demonstrating that they are the elite; smarter, more rational, and morally superior to everyone else.\u201d A reshaped GOP would be very conservative, but not radical. It would believe in limited government, but a government run by professionals, respecting data and science, and operating efficiently and fairly. It would believe in genuine fiscal discipline. It would try to apply free-market approaches to solving difficult problems, such as climate change. It would believe in the integrity of institutions and insist that those in office adhere to high ethical standards. It would respect the sanctity of alliances and the fundamental values of decency and equal treatment. It would work to broaden its base across racial and ethnic lines, not use division and voter suppression to cling to power. Sadly, even if Donald Trump is defeated in November, there is no sign that such a party will return anytime soon. But restoring the Republican Party to its traditional values is absolutely essential to preserve the core of our system of governance.","headline":"I\u2019ve Witnessed the Decline of the Republican Party","article_name":614983.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/decline-gop\/614983\/","date_published":"2020-08-06 10:15:00","article_length":12879,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:24.460474","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/decline-gop\/614983\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Major disasters and challenging long-term weather conditions are weakening local governments, increasing racial and class inequality, and reducing trust in government. T he damage from Hurricane Michael is still being cataloged. After the Category 4 storm made landfall in the Florida Panhandle two weeks ago, it ripped through parts of Florida and Georgia, killing dozens and destroying homes and vital infrastructure in rural communities. Residents don\u2019t yet have a full account of the lives and property erased in the calamity, and even when they do, that accounting will only provide a rough estimate of what was lost. More difficult still will be dealing with the intangibles: the exhaustion and mental-health consequences, the frayed sense of security and safety, the missed school days, and the deepening vulnerability among people who faced the storm. As the country deals with an onslaught of powerful hurricanes and other weather-related events, those intangibles have become more evident, and more and more important. Michael is\u2014according to experts I spoke with\u2014both a harbinger of a future climate and a representative of a class of disasters that in the past few years have exposed the vulnerabilities of local and national institutions. Those disasters have highlighted the role of inequality, civic instability, and poor planning in amplifying the effects of both extreme and mundane weather. The evidence seems to be mounting that not only will the developing climate regime, if sustained, expose the cracks in the American democratic project, but it will also widen them. The recent report from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides a grim vision of the near future. It finds that major, irreversible effects on ecosystems and natural resources are all but unavoidable, because they will likely occur at a lower temperature threshold than previously estimated. Read: How to understand the UN\u2019s dire new climate report On a human level, the IPCC report portends a cascade of troubling scenarios unless immediate action is taken: Droughts, floods, rising seas and heat indices, and famines will be disastrous for populations, especially the masses that continue to crowd global urban areas. Coastlines and wetlands will change faster than cities\u2019 abilities to adapt. Human movement will warp boundaries and spark conflict. The report finds that, in the present day, \u201cpoverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming,\u201d and that those disadvantages will increase over time. Even under President Donald Trump\u2014who has abdicated national climate responsibilities\u2014the global realities of a changing planet have become a part of American security policy. The 2017 defense-reauthorization bill included findings that \u201cclimate instability will lead to instability in geopolitics and impact American military operations around the world.\u201d Those conclusions build on quadrennial reviews from the Defense Department that conceptualize climate change as a global security risk. \u201cThese effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions,\u201d states the 2014 review . Taken together, all of these forecasts envision a world in which major disasters weaken states and deepen conflicts, breaking safety nets and alliances alike. They predict the degradation of governance as economic outputs decrease, people are displaced, and global food resources falter. The Defense Department calls climate effects \u201cthreat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions.\u201d As Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, told me, these dramatic scenarios are actually supported by human history, which illustrates the rise of conflict during times of environmental pressure. \u201cThis seems almost like a science-fiction scenario, but in fact it\u2019s a well-written thing in the geological and climate record,\u201d said Zaelke, whose Washington-based nonprofit focuses on the future of international governance. According to several climate researchers, those long-term global trends are already identifiable at the local level. Zaelke told me Hurricane Michael, like other recent storms, provided a sneak peek at the ways that climate-linked disasters are intensified by a lack of political will to mitigate climate change, which can in turn destabilize governments and sap them of the policy muscle needed to adapt. Though Michael hit a storm-prone stretch of the Deep South, this feedback loop is relevant across the country. Climate denialism among Republican policy makers, who dominate at the state and national levels, dictates that even acknowledging changing weather patterns can constitute a political loss, let alone planning for them in advance. When catastrophes hit, lawmakers funnel funds toward recovery, but they don\u2019t invest in measures that could improve future resilience. And even if state and local governments do want to plan for the future, disasters\u2019 aftereffects are already constraining their ability to do so. \u201cCosts are starting to mount for adaptation and resilience,\u201d Zaelke says. As a 2016 Freddie Mac report about the risks of climate change to housing markets states : \u201cRising sea levels and spreading flood plains [appear] likely to destroy billions of dollars in property and to displace millions of people. The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.\u201d P roperty taxation is the foundation of most local governance, and climate risks, in some areas, threaten municipalities\u2019 ability to meet the needs of their citizens. This is already evident in Miami, where the city has spent over $100 million to combat flooding and protect the city from sinking into the ocean\u2014a sum that will only rise in future years and must be diverted from the local budget. And climate change is influencing the property-tax base that fuels that budget, too. As the Miami Herald reports , about $17 million worth of taxes will come from properties that will face regular flooding by 2030. Under current projections, about $100 million worth of taxes will come from properties facing regular flooding by 2100. * According to the Freddie Mac report, Miami is representative of the threat facing coastal cities across the United States. But property is only one part of the tax-and-local-governance equation. Metropolitan areas also face rising populations, which create a classic supply-demand crisis in housing markets where attrition from climate change and the threat of hurricane damage are becoming more and more burdensome. As a result, \u201cclimate gentrification\u201d\u2014involving the inflation of the land value of high ground and the displacement of poorer people from those areas\u2014looms over American cities. As a study this year from Harvard University researchers indicates, the theoretical risk of climate gentrification may already be shaping Miami\u2019s housing market, as preferences for higher ground appear to be emerging. In Georgia and Florida alike, Hurricane Michael inflicted visible political and economic effects on the hardest-hit counties, which tended to be rural and poor. The infrastructure in many places\u2014 like the dirt roads in Jackson County, Florida , or the water and power lines sustaining small towns and hamlets across the region\u2014is incredibly fragile, and the loss of those systems has multiplicative effects in the near and longer term. In the aftermath of the storm, the infrastructure damage remains life-threatening: It\u2019s endangered people who have chronic illnesses, made the work of rescue and recovery that much more difficult, and compounded the other woes brought on by the storm, like reduced access to groceries and clean water. The need to rebuild infrastructure will squeeze cash-strapped counties and could spur more people to move away, depleting local tax bases. Essentially, both the steady drumbeat of ordinary climate-based problems and the crescendo of exceptional disasters could strain the basic model of how American government works, destroying tax bases, uprooting people, and sending them careening from one vulnerable area to the next. The same framework can be applied in places where sea-level rise isn\u2019t a major threat\u2014for example, inland towns, such as Princeville, North Carolina, that are located on major waterways and see existential risks from floods, or drought-plagued California towns that haven\u2019t built enough of a tax base to fight those dry spells over the long term. As heat, disaster risks, and rising seas bombard local governments, the ability of those governments to fulfill their basic functions\u2014the delivery of services, the maintenance of the safety net, and managing civil, familial, and educational institutions\u2014could be degraded, too. This could manifest in three distinct phenomena that are already on display in disaster-affected areas: the increased dominance of private and developer-class interests in local politics, the acceleration of existing wealth inequality, and the collapse of institutions dedicated to disaster response. With the current science available, it\u2019s impossible to tell whether the recent hurricanes, fires, floods, heat waves, and droughts that have affected cities across the United States were themselves caused by a changing climate. But what research does indicate is that a warmer Earth is intensifying, and will continue to intensify, those events, which means stronger hurricanes, storms that grow more quickly before landfall , longer-lived forest fires , and more unpredictable flash floods. A white paper on Hurricane Sandy from the Superstorm Research Lab sums up the three social phenomena of disasters and describes how they might be intensified, too. \u201cOn one hand, the crisis was seen as a weather event that created physical and economic damage, and temporarily moved New York City away from its status quo,\u201d the authors write, referring to the 2012 storm. \u201cOn the other hand, Hurricane Sandy exacerbated crises which existed before the storm and continued afterwards in heightened form, including poverty, lack of affordable housing, precarious or low employment, and unequal access to resources generally.\u201d As Hurricane Sandy illustrated\u2014like Katrina had years before\u2014disasters and hostile climate conditions don\u2019t create inequalities; they exacerbate them. \u201cDisasters do not discriminate on their impact, but when we see differential consequences, that\u2019s [when] we see the disparities in preexisting conditions,\u201d said Erin Bergren, a visiting professor at North Central College in Illinois and one of the authors of the Sandy paper. \u201cThe post-disaster conditions are premised on the pre-disaster conditions.\u201d Vulnerable people\u2014especially racial minorities\u2014are more likely to live in floodplains and have housing that isn\u2019t insured or built to code. They are less likely than people with means to have reliable air conditioning. They are less likely to be able to evacuate , and they have less built-in community and familial resilience to deal with short- or long-term weather shocks than do people in wealthier, whiter communities. These differences pose existential risks to the lower classes in America. But over the next century, they could also sap savings and wealth, and could hide or reverse any wage gains these communities have made. In other words: If American society is already trending toward greater inequality, this all means that climate change will accelerate that trend. \u201cIf disasters are possibilities for social reorganization, then climate change is as well,\u201d Bergren said. Read: Climate science will come too late for some poor countries. Evidence exists that this social reorganization is already under way. In an August article in the quarterly journal Social Problems , the researchers Junia Howell from the University of Pittsburgh and James Elliott from Rice University indicate that the \u201ctwo defining social problems of our day\u2014wealth inequality and rising natural hazard damages\u2014are dynamically linked.\u201d The findings are stark. Using data on thousands of families in areas where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent disaster aid, Howell and Elliott demonstrate that white families in disaster-prone areas actually gained an average of $126,000 between 1999 and 2013. But black families in those areas lost an average of $27,000, and Latino families lost an average of $29,000. To put it more succinctly: \u201cThe more FEMA aid a county receives, the more unequal wealth becomes between more and less advantaged residents, holding all else constant.\u201d The most immediate consequence of climate change won\u2019t be an abrupt entry into an alien Anthropocene hell. It\u2019s more likely to be a slow descent. Racial wealth gaps will increase. Racial health disparities will be exacerbated. Sprawling metropolises and rural hamlets alike will face steeper and steeper budgetary constraints (and could be forced to rely heavily on fees and fines to keep the lights on, a move that some cash-strapped local governments have already made and one that disproportionately affects poor or minority residents). Housing markets will continue to realign in favor of displacement and the creation of a migrant, renter class. Marginalized neighborhoods will continue to shoulder a majority of the environmental burden. Trust in government will continue to decline as it proves unable to help people plan for or respond to climate effects. Elections will be disrupted by disasters, fewer and fewer people will have real attachments to local civic life, and even the concept of a local or national shared destiny will suffer as the haves are shielded from consequences. And disasters can and will rapidly push each of these weaknesses to crisis points, even as the rolling disaster of environmental change makes crises incrementally more likely every day. And underlying every crisis is the threat of autocracy. M y colleague Robinson Meyer  has suggested that Donald Trump is the first global leader who embodies the future of climate authoritarianism. This is a persuasive argument. Although the president routinely dismisses climate science, he does have a keen eye on widening social and economic fault lines, and\u2014most critically\u2014he knows how to wield them to his advantage. He instinctively picks up on rising anti-immigrant sentiment, which is spreading internationally and is linked to climate change; identifies burgeoning insecurities about the global distribution of resources; and sells himself as a figure of stability and order amid visions of chaos. \u201cInsofar as his supporters are drawn to him by a sense of global calamity,\u201d Meyer writes, \u201cand insofar as his rhetoric singles out the refugee as yet another black and brown intruder trying to violate the nation\u2019s cherished borders, Trump is the first demagogue of the Anthropocene.\u201d In the two years since Meyer wrote that essay, Trump has done nothing to rebut the argument. There\u2019s probably never been an administration in American history more ill-equipped to deal with disasters. Owing at least in part to the administration\u2019s incompetence, the federal response to Hurricane Maria\u2019s devastation last year in Puerto Rico was a disaster. Trump has since abandoned responsibility by claiming that credible reports of thousands of deaths on the island are partisan hoaxes . Since the storm hit, Puerto Rico has felt its own slide into the murky waters of a less-than-democratic future, as its colonial status has clearly limited recovery options and accelerated migration to the mainland, and a new federally mandated austerity program reorganizes the island\u2019s economy to meet the needs of creditors. At the same time, Trump has only escalated his anti-immigration rhetoric, presenting a strongman figure for his base. His racism and racial divisiveness seem to serve a millennialist view of a world in decline\u2014one where there isn\u2019t enough to go around, where martial strength is the only recourse, and where the rules and niceties of a previous era must be abandoned. Donald Trump is a character of the moment. He\u2019s a developer with famous properties in New York, New Jersey, and Miami, during a time when developers in flooding areas have been ceded more and more local control . He\u2019s the culmination of a crisis of faith in government and widening racial differences in opinion over the future, both of which can possibly be traced back to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . The political polarization and gerrymandering that enabled both his ascent and the strength of his party in Congress were most certainly aided by the displacement of people of color from cities over the past few decades . He\u2019s the natural political conclusion of widening class and racial wealth gaps, and the heir to a system in which state and local governments have more regularly faced budget shortfalls. And climate change contributed to, contributes to, or will contribute to each of these in due time. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis that we can still deal with if we wake up,\u201d Zaelke says. But the awakening doesn\u2019t just mean accepting the science, and in the American context it doesn\u2019t just mean finally overcoming the grip of climate denialism on politics. In the IPCC\u2019s reading, and in the telling of several of the most vocal climate activists, the changes that the world must undertake in order to rein in climate change will be \u201cunprecedented\u201d and will require monumental shifts in governance and economics. By all accounts, the task ahead is a moon shot. But perhaps the familiarity of the challenges before the country provides an opportunity. The disasters predicted under even the worst-case scenarios aren\u2019t supernatural; rather, they are macro-level disturbances created by millions of local, often imperceptible perturbances. The cracks of inequality that look likely to widen into chasms of autocracy in the next century were all created by humans, and can all be conquered by them, too. *  This article originally mischaracterized the projected property values of flooded areas in Miami.

{"id":null,"body":"Extreme-weather events represent an irresistible force for action. But an immovable object is in the way. Mary Nichols has been part of the struggle to prevent catastrophic climate change for about as long as anyone in American life. For years, she\u2019s directed California\u2019s pathbreaking efforts to reduce carbon emissions as the chair of the California Air Resources Board\u2014a position she held first in the 1970s before taking it up again in 2007. Nichols has also served at the federal level, working as the chief regulator for air pollution at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. And yet even Nichols has never seen anything that crystallizes the dangers of climate change more clearly than the historic outbreak of wildfires scorching California and other western states this year. \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d she told me earlier this week, when I asked her whether this year\u2019s fires are the most tangible danger to California that she\u2019s seen from climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s not suddenly going to reverse itself \u2026 to years when there\u2019s no fire season, or it\u2019s not going to happen until October. The changes are going to be real, and they are going to be long-lasting.\u201d Carol Browner served as the EPA administrator for both of Clinton\u2019s presidential terms and later worked as President Barack Obama\u2019s first White House adviser on climate. When she looks at the confluence of extreme-weather events battering the United States in recent years\u2014not only the wildfires, but also the Gulf Coast hurricanes, Midwest flooding, and the Southwest\u2019s extreme heat\u2014Browner likewise sees stark evidence that climate change is disrupting American life earlier and more powerfully than almost anyone expected when the debate over these issues seriously began about three decades ago. \u201cWhat we have now is the absolute environmental demonstration or evidence of just how dramatic the impact of climate change is going to be. This is not going to stop,\u201d Browner told me. \u201cThere is going to be something next year, and the year after, if we don\u2019t get on it.\u201d Environmental scientists and policy experts around the country agree that the massive wildfires are just the latest indicator that climate change has thrust the U.S., and the world, into a dangerous new era. But it\u2019s far from certain that the growing recognition of that threat can break the stalemate over climate policy in Washington. The accumulating evidence about climate change\u2019s destructive power represents an irresistible force for action. But it\u2019s colliding with an immovable object: the unbreakable resistance to any response among both Republican voters and elected officials. Polling shows that, overall, a growing share of Americans believe climate change is happening, that human activities are driving it, and that the threat is manifesting right now. But as on many issues, the gap on all of these questions is widening between voters in the Republican coalition and other Americans. Annual polls by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication show that although the numbers have increased markedly for Democrats, Republican partisans are no more likely than in 2008 to believe that human activity is causing climate change, and they express even less concern about its impact now than they did then. (Belief in human causation has declined somewhat among independents, but concern about the effects of climate change has increased substantially.) Read: The most important number for the West\u2019s hideous fire season These attitudes within the GOP coalition both reflect and reinforce Republican officials\u2019 rejection of any effort to reduce carbon emissions. President Donald Trump, echoed by many prominent conservative commentators and congressional Republicans , continues to dismiss the evidence that climate change is even contributing to the spike in extreme-weather events. With Joe Biden offering the most aggressive climate-change agenda of any Democratic presidential nominee in history, the conditions for the long-stalled debate over the issue in Washington are becoming as combustible as the dried forest floors of California. Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale climate program, says that in the past, even those Americans concerned about climate change tended to see it as a remote problem. \u201cIt was distant in time, [in] that the impacts won\u2019t be felt for a generation or more,\u201d he told me. And it was \u201cdistant in space\u201d\u2014\u201cthis is about polar bears and maybe some developing countries, but not the United States \u2026 not my friends, not my family, not me.\u201d Seen through that lens, he said, climate \u201cjust blended in the background with 1,000 other issues out there \u2026 so we can deal with it later. That\u2019s where more of the country was in 2007 and 2008. Now we skip forward to today, that\u2019s not true anymore because of the [weather] events we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d In Yale\u2019s polling , the share of Americans who say that climate change is affecting weather at least somewhat reached nearly three-fifths in 2020, up from about half in early 2013. But Leiserowitz said more disruptive weather events aren\u2019t the only things moving attitudes on climate. Another important factor is the broad, diverse chorus of voices expressing worry about it. Ten years ago, he noted, Americans might have heard concern about the climate only from \u201cenvironmentalists and liberal politicians like Al Gore\u201d; now it\u2019s much more common to hear concerns raised by public-health professionals, business executives, and even faith leaders, such as Pope Francis . The result has been an undeniable, though not overwhelming, shift in public opinion. In Yale\u2019s latest national survey this spring, slightly more than three-fifths of Americans said human activities are causing the climate to change, a new high. The share of Americans who say they are very worried about climate change\u2019s impact is relatively modest, at 27 percent. But it\u2019s nearly double the level it was in 2008; overall, about two-thirds of respondents are now either very or somewhat worried. Americans\u2019 attitudes about the imminence of the danger have changed more drastically: 45 percent in the latest survey described climate change as a threat to Americans now, a big increase from 33 percent in 2008. The share who say climate change won\u2019t be a problem for 25 years or more is at 42 percent, down 10 points compared with 2008. Yet, on all of these fronts, the movement has not been symmetrical. Democrats are expressing much more concern than they were a decade ago, and most independents slightly more. Republicans, meanwhile, are either no more or even less concerned. (Rigid GOP attitudes largely explain why the overall shift in public opinion on many questions hasn\u2019t been more dramatic, despite the quickening pace of weather disruption.) Since 2008, for instance, the share of Democrats who say human activity is causing climate change has spiked from 70 percent to 85 percent; among Republicans, it\u2019s virtually unchanged, at just 37 percent. And although nearly half of Democrats now say they are very worried about climate change (almost double the level in 2008), only about one in 14 Republicans is equally concerned. That share is essentially unchanged from 12 years ago. This pattern of public attitudes looks very similar to opinions on racial-equity issues: Compared with a decade ago, substantially more Democrats of all races accept that systemic racism against Black Americans is a serious problem; however, many Republicans are even less likely to agree it exists compared with 10 years ago. The divergence between the parties on climate, as on race, reflects the larger resorting of the electorate along lines of culture rather than class. (Republicans, as I\u2019ve written , increasingly rely on a coalition of older, non-college-educated, evangelical, and rural white voters, while Democrats depend heavily on young people, people of color, and college-educated white Americans.) Just as many Republican voters have cheered GOP attacks on public-health experts during the coronavirus crisis, portraying them as \u201celites\u201d who look down on and want to control ordinary people, they have embraced similar accusations against climate scientists. \u201cClimate change is an issue \u2026 where most people don\u2019t know that much \u2026 and in those circumstances\u2014especially for an abstract, seemingly far away, invisible problem like climate change\u2014they look to their leaders to help guide them through that incredibly complicated landscape,\u201d Leiserowitz told me. \u201cRepublicans who began talking about climate change as if it was a \u2018hoax\u2019 had an incredible impact on other Republicans.\u201d Many environmentalists have hoped that more and more exposure to the furious effects of weather disruption might soften resistance among Republican voters and leaders to acting on climate change. But in dramatic polling last year from the Kaiser Family Foundation and The Washington Post , even Republican voters who acknowledge that their communities are facing more extreme weather overwhelmingly reject the notion that climate change is significantly contributing to those events. Read: Two disasters are exponentially worse than one Detailed results provided to me by Kaiser underscore an astonishing gap between the parties. Among people who agree that their communities are experiencing either more hot days, more floods, or more droughts, at least three-fourths of Democrats say climate change is a \u201cmajor factor\u201d in those events; but at least seven in 10 Republicans in each case say it is only a minor factor, or does not contribute at all. Slightly more than seven in 10 Democrats living in places experiencing more wildfires consider climate change a major factor in causing them; three-fourths of Republicans see climate as little or none of the cause. Even after this summer\u2019s searing events, an Economist \/YouGov poll released yesterday found that although three-fourths of Biden supporters said \u201cthe severity of recent hurricanes and Western wildfires is most likely the result of global climate change,\u201d fewer than one in five Trump voters agreed. Those contrasts offer very little reason for optimism that even if Biden wins, any meaningful numbers of congressional or state-level Republicans will feel pressure to support measures to reduce carbon emissions. Among other reasons for pessimism: In both presidential and Senate elections, Republicans are more and more reliant on the states that produce the most fossil fuels, which tend to be the same states with large populations of non-college-educated, Christian, and rural white voters drawn to Trump\u2019s message of racial and cultural backlash. Across the 20 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output\u2014a good proxy for states\u2019 integration into the fossil-fuel economy\u2014Republicans now hold 35 of their 40 Senate seats. That\u2019s nearly enough senators to sustain a GOP filibuster against climate action on its own. The final brick in the wall of GOP opposition is that fossil-fuel producers, once an important source of campaign funding for southern Democrats such as Lyndon B. Johnson, are all-in on bolstering Republican power. Over the past 30 years, oil and gas producers have directed more than 80 percent of their massive $711 million in total federal campaign contributions toward Republicans, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Gene Karpinski, the longtime president of the League of Conservation Voters, the environmental movement\u2019s principal electoral arm, sees little prospect for GOP participation on climate even if Trump loses. \u201cBecause of the fossil-fuel influence on the Republican Party and the leader of the party still calling climate change a \u2018hoax,\u2019\u201d GOP skepticism about \u201cclimate change is out of step with the rest of the country,\u201d he says. But others see some cracks in the resistance. Kenneth Medlock, the director of the Center for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston, says the terms of daily discussion in Texas and in neighboring states have changed since Houston was deluged with historic floods during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. \u201cEven in the Gulf Coast, the conversation around extreme-weather events and the like is more the norm than it was five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cUp until Harvey happened, nobody really wanted to address the elephant in the room, which is that the climate is changing and this is a real risk.\u201d Even with that evolving dialogue, Medlock doesn\u2019t expect big changes among Republican elected officials in Texas. He predicts that, to the extent that they acknowledge climate change, they would be more likely to talk about fortifying communities against its effects (an issue he considers important too) than to talk about reducing carbon emissions. But Medlock anticipates that position will become more and more untenable for Republicans over time\u2014not because their voters necessarily demand more action, but because the business community and institutional investors will keep moving ahead without them to cut carbon. The dialogue among elected Republicans, he told me, \u201chas kind of quietly shifted.\u201d He explained that the Baker Institute, which is based at Rice University, is involved in several initiatives aimed at reducing net-carbon emissions in the region. \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about [those] efforts is that when we talk to state lawmakers and federal lawmakers [including Republicans], there\u2019s no resistance,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou open the conversation with, \u2018The world is changing; consumers and investors are demanding lower carbon footprints; this is an economic opportunity for Texas \u2026\u2019 and immediately the conversation becomes very lively. So, in some ways, it\u2019s about how you approach the conversation.\u201d Sean McElwee, the Data for Progress pollster who analyzes progressive causes, sees a similar opening. Although most Republican voters still recoil from measures presented as addressing climate change, more are open to promoting clean-energy sources, he says. (Yale\u2019s polling has found that too.) \u201cWhen we do testing \u2026 clean energies are very popular among Republican voters, and people are really interested in the jobs framework,\u201d he told me. Just as important: Relatively few Republican voters intuitively embrace arguments from Trump and others that defending oil, gas, and coal is a culture-war statement against \u201celitists\u201d promoting solar and wind energies. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters have an allegiance to coal and oil the way Republican politicians have,\u201d he said. Browner, the former EPA head, is also a voice of relative optimism. \u201cIf Biden wins and they start moving forward\u201d with a climate agenda, she told me, \u201cthere will be Republicans calling. Maybe I\u2019m a minority on this, but when they see you are serious and you want to do something, they want a seat at the table.\u201d Read: This is the future that liberals want Even if Republicans remain obdurate, unified Democratic control of Congress and the White House is more likely to produce climate action than the last Democratic trifecta in 2009 and 2010, most experts I spoke with said. At that point, the House Democratic Caucus still contained a large number of southern and rural \u201cblue dog\u201d members who resisted cap-and-trade climate legislation the chamber passed in 2009. (Forty-four Democrats voted no .) Now the House Democratic Caucus is overwhelmingly centered on urban and suburban districts where acting on climate is popular. As Karpinski said: \u201cIf you look at 2018, the key reason why Nancy Pelosi is now the speaker [is because] it\u2019s mostly suburban and some of the semi-urban districts. It\u2019s a combination of young people, communities of color, and suburban women. They are the most supportive of this issue and want action.\u201d If Biden wins and Democrats gain the Senate majority, he could drive a big part of his climate agenda through a coronavirus-relief stimulus package; his plan includes massive spending to promote renewable power, electric cars, and energy-efficiency upgrades for homes and businesses. Obama did the same thing in the stimulus package he signed to counter the Great Recession, tucking in huge investments in clean energy (that Biden as vice president was assigned to oversee ). But to secure Senate approval for measures that directly limit carbon emissions, Democrats would almost certainly have to end the filibuster, which empowers what I\u2019ve called the \u201cbrown blockade\u201d of Senate Republicans who represent the fossil-fuel-producing states. (Unable to overcome a filibuster, the Senate never considered the cap-and-trade climate bill the House passed in 2009.) And even if Democrats do end the filibuster, serious climate legislation could face a tight squeeze to reach a simple majority, with Joe Manchin, from coal-producing West Virginia, and possibly other Democratic senators having to take a very tough vote. All of those outcomes are impossible to predict. But what\u2019s clear is that the tension will grow between a sluggish political system locked in a partisan standoff and a climate system that is poised to generate disruption at an accelerating pace. \u201cThis is not some \u2018new normal\u2019 that we can plan around \u2026 it\u2019s a system that continues to spiral out of control,\u201d says Vijay Limaye, an environmental epidemiologist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThere definitely is a signal in these record-setting months that \u2026 we are heading into a new era when we will see records set, and they will fall just as quickly \u2026 It\u2019s hard for people to wrap their heads around now, but as bad as things have been this year, unquestionably, they will get worse.\u201d Nichols, the veteran climate regulator, is just as stark in her warning: Even today\u2019s extreme weather may soon seem like the (relative) calm before the storm. \u201cThe rate of change is accelerating, so it is absolutely possible that we\u2019ll see more visible signs of bigger storms,\u201d as well as higher temperatures and sea-level rise, she said. \u201cAll of those things could happen much faster.\u201d She explained that the famous apocalyptic scene from the movie The Day After Tomorrow still isn\u2019t likely to happen, where big waves wash over the skyscrapers of New York City. \u201cBut bigger storms and more damage and loss of property and loss of life as a result absolutely is likely going to continue\u2014not just in a gradual slope, but at a rate of acceleration that is greater than was predicted before,\u201d she said. The biggest message of the California wildfires may be that not only the terms but the tense of the climate debate is changing. Climate change has evolved from something that will threaten America to something that is doing so today. \u201cThe people who used to talk about how they were trying to save the world for their grandchildren need to start thinking about their children and even themselves,\u201d Nichols said.","headline":"Why Republicans Still Don\u2019t Care About Climate Change","article_name":616380.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/09\/california-wildfires-and-politics-climate-change\/616380\/","date_published":"2020-09-17 15:03:25","article_length":18830,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:25.126145","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/09\/california-wildfires-and-politics-climate-change\/616380\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Twenty-one children brought a lawsuit arguing that the government needs to act on climate change. A federal court dismissed it. The American Revolution had scarcely been over a month when, in a farewell letter to the Continental Army, General George Washington admitted something startling: The War of Independence wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing.  At least, it wasn\u2019t yet. \u201cIt is yet to be decided,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhether the Revolution must ultimately be considered as a blessing or a curse.\u201d His audience had just spent eight years on this fight, but he urged them to look past the current decade and even the current century. The new country would shape the future of far more people than just the troops themselves, he cautioned, and the success or failure of the United States would determine the life course of every American who would ever be born. \u201cFor with our fate,\u201d Washington wrote, \u201c will the destiny of unborn Millions be involved .\u201d Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an extraordinary lawsuit brought by several of those millions against their own government. Twenty-one American children alleged that the federal government\u2019s failure to fight climate change was not only poor public policy or an abdication of leadership, but also a violation of the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment says that Americans cannot be \u201cdeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The children\u2019s complaint centered on the word life : By losing a \u201cclimate system capable of sustaining human life,\u201d they argued, they had been stripped of their constitutional rights. A panel of three federal judges disagreed. \u201cEven assuming such a broad constitutional right exists,\u201d the judicial branch cannot do anything about it, ruled Judge Andrew Hurwitz, writing for a two-judge majority. The courts, he \u201creluctantly\u201d wrote, simply do not have the broad power to mandate climate policy under the Constitution. He advised the kids to go to Congress or the White House instead. \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large, the latter of which can change the composition of the political branches through the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat the other branches may have abdicated their responsibility to remediate the problem does not confer on \u2026 courts, no matter how well-intentioned, the ability to step into their shoes.\u201d (Or their hip waders, presumably, if the flooding is bad.) Read: T rump isn\u2019t a climate denier. He\u2019s worse. The case was always a long shot, and the response of even the friendliest legal experts has been dismay but not surprise . I\u2019ll admit that, as a climate reporter, I had tuned the case out. The kids were asking a federal court\u2014and, inevitably, the Supreme Court\u2014to take one of its most extraordinary interventions into American life since Brown v. Board of Education , which ended lawful racial segregation in public schools. Yet addressing the climate crisis through the judiciary would be much harder than abolishing segregation\u2014and everyone in the case seemed to know it. As the kids\u2019 legal team argued, fixing climate change requires the full-scale transformation of the country\u2019s energy system. It would require investing money in some practices and banning others. It would, at the very least, require the government to stop leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction. This kind of detail-oriented policy making always makes judges nervous. Federal judges are a peaceable cohort who, faced even with a grave crisis, prefer to stick to conflict resolution. The kids, in response to this issue, asked the courts merely to order that Congress and the president write their own plan to fight climate change. Even this proved too ambitious. Hurwitz ruled that even if the courts issued such an order, there would be no way to measure the sufficiency of the plan without again engaging in judicial policy making. And honestly, that may be a blessing for climate-concerned progressives. Since the kids first sued, in 2015, the judiciary has been flooded with conservatives: One in every four circuit judges is now a Donald Trump appointee. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court\u2019s environmental swing vote, has retired. It was never clear to me why the kids\u2019 presumably left-leaning lawyers wanted this newly conservative judiciary and this Supreme Court to formulate new constitutional climate law. And yet. As I read the sole dissenting opinion in the case, written by Judge Josephine Staton, I found myself moved. I urge you to read it, even if you are not familiar with legal jargon or if you are broadly skeptical of the case\u2019s aims. I\u2019ve reproduced it below. Read: The concession to climate change I will not make Staton\u2019s opinion deals directly with the question that Washington raised almost 240 years ago: What role should all those \u201cunborn Millions\u201d\u2014those many future Americans\u2014play in the constitutional order? (This is not a question about the start of biological life: Whether you think life begins in the first trimester or the fourth, a 50-year-old in 2080 will still be a legal person, even if he does not exist today.) And more to the point, what responsibility does the country have to preserve itself for the future? Can the courts help the United States be a \u201cblessing\u201d forever? It is also written urgently and plainly, if you ignore the occasional legal citation. It frames a growing rift on the left, about whether it\u2019s best to address climate change through slow progress achieved institutionally or through a decisive rupture. (Every judge on the panel, including those who ruled against the kids, was appointed by a Democratic president.) And frankly, it\u2019s like reading a document from an alternate universe\u2014a much kinder one\u2014in which America\u2019s elected and appointed rulers take climate change seriously and debate the intensity of their response, rather than concern-trolling about whether the planet is warming at all. The dissent begins with a thunderclap. \u201cIn these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response\u2014yet presses ahead toward calamity,\u201d Staton writes. \u201cIt is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the Nation.\u201d This is the central thrust of Staton\u2019s argument: that according to studies conducted by the federal government \u2014studies that were not challenged by either the Trump administration or the courts\u2014climate change has the potential to destroy the federal government. \u201cPlaintiffs bring suit to enforce the most basic structural principle embedded in our system of ordered liberty: that the Constitution does not condone the Nation\u2019s willful destruction,\u201d she writes. In the face of such danger, even partial action by the judiciary is justified. \u201cConsidering plaintiffs seek no less than to forestall the Nation\u2019s demise,\u201d she says, \u201ceven a partial and temporary reprieve would constitute meaningful redress.\u201d The physics of the threat of climate change specifically justify action, since every additional molecule of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere makes global warming worse. \u201cThe majority portrays any relief we can offer as just a drop in the bucket,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn a previous generation, perhaps that characterization would carry the day and we would hold ourselves impotent to address plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. But we are perilously close to an overflowing bucket. These final drops matter. A lot. Properly framed, a court order\u2014even one that merely postpones the day when remedial measures become insufficiently effective\u2014would likely have a real impact on preventing the impending cataclysm.\u201d Furthermore, she argues that the courts do have an extraordinary responsibility to take action when the nation\u2014or the Constitution\u2014is threatened. \u201cIn taking the Presidential Oath, the Executive must vow to \u2018preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u2019\u201d Staton writes. Emphasis on preserve there. And the country\u2019s most beloved leaders have since grappled with this \u201cperpetuity principle\u201d: Faced with the South\u2019s secession, President Lincoln reaffirmed that the Constitution did not countenance its own destruction. \u201c[T]he Union of these States is perpetual[,]\u201d he reasoned in his First Inaugural Address, because \u201c[p]erpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.\u201d And what about the idea that courts cannot oversee a policy response to climate change? \u201cOn a fundamental point, we agree: No case can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change predicted by the government and scientists,\u201d she writes of her agreement with the majority. \u201cBut a federal court need not manage all of the delicate foreign relations and regulatory minutiae implicated by climate change to offer real relief, and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution.\u201d Finally, she argues that such action must come now. \u201cWere we addressing a matter of social injustice, one might sincerely lament any delay, but take solace that \u2018the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice,\u2019\u201d she writes. Some 91 years passed between the Emancipation Proclamation and Brown v. Board of Education. \u201cThe denial of an individual, constitutional right\u2014though grievous and harmful\u2014can be corrected in the future, even if it takes 91 years. And that possibility provides hope for future generations.\u201d \u201cWhere is the hope in today\u2019s decision?\u201d she asks. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on science, specifically, an impending point of no return. If plaintiffs\u2019 fears, backed by the government\u2019s own studies , prove true, history will not judge us kindly. When the seas envelop our coastal cities, fires and droughts haunt our interiors, and storms ravage everything between, those remaining will ask: Why did so many do so little?\u201d Of course, the dissent did not work. The children\u2019s case has failed. Today, the United States finds itself in a cruel and odd position. Most Americans now believe that climate change represents a concerning threat. Yet the two branches constitutionally empowered to do anything about it have, so far, shirked that duty, and it is not clear that further public persuasion will stir them to action. Now the judiciary has tied its hands on the issue. It is time to start asking what changes must take place\u2014perhaps in the Constitution itself\u2014for the country to begin to fight this threat. I\u2019ve posted Staton\u2019s full dissent below. STATON, District Judge, dissenting: In these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response\u2014yet presses ahead toward calamity. It is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the Nation. My colleagues throw up their hands, concluding that this case presents nothing fit for the Judiciary. On a fundamental point, we agree: No case can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change predicted by the government and scientists. But a federal court need not manage all of the delicate foreign relations and regulatory minutiae implicated by climate change to offer real relief, and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution. Plaintiffs bring suit to enforce the most basic structural principle embedded in our system of ordered liberty: that the Constitution does not condone the Nation\u2019s willful destruction. So viewed, plaintiffs\u2019 claims adhere to a judicially administrable standard. And considering plaintiffs seek no less than to forestall the Nation\u2019s demise, even a partial and temporary reprieve would constitute meaningful redress. Such relief, much like the desegregation orders and statewid e prison injunctions the Supreme Court has sanctioned, would vindicate plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights without exceeding the Judiciary\u2019s province. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. As the majority recognizes, and the government does not contest, carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d) and other greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions created by burning fossil fuels are devastating the planet. According to one of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, the inevitable result, absent immediate action, is \u201can inhospitable future . . . marked by rising seas, coastal city functionality loss, mass migrations, resource wars, food shortages, heat waves, mega-storms, soil depletion and desiccation, freshwater shortage, public health system collapse, and the extinction of increasing numbers of species.\u201d Even government scientists2 project that, given current warming trends, sea levels will rise two feet by 2050, nearly four feet by 2070, over eight feet by 2100, 18 feet by 2150, and over 31 feet by 2200. To put that in perspective, a three-foot sea level rise will make two million American homes uninhabitable; a rise of approximately 20 feet will result in the total loss of Miami, New Orleans, and other coastal cities. So, as described by plaintiffs\u2019 experts, the injuries experienced by plaintiffs are the first small wave in an oncoming tsunami\u2014now visible on the horizon of the not-so-distant future\u2014that will destroy the United States as we currently know it. What sets this harm apart from all others is not just its magnitude, but its irreversibility. The devastation might look and feel somewhat different if future generations could simply pick up the pieces and restore the Nation. But plaintiffs\u2019 experts speak of a certain level of global warming as \u201clocking in\u201d this catastrophic damage. Put more starkly by plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Harold R. Wanless, \u201c[a]tmospheric warming will continue for some 30 years after we stop putting more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. But that warmed atmosphere will continue warming the ocean for centuries, and the accumulating heat in the oceans will persist for millennia\u201d (emphasis added). Indeed, another of plaintiffs\u2019 experts echoes, \u201c[t]he fact that GHGs dissipate very slowly from the atmosphere . . . and that the costs of taking CO2 out of the atmosphere through non-biological carbon capture and storage are very high means that the consequences of GHG emissions should be viewed as effectively irreversible\u201d (emphasis added). In other words, \u201c[g]iven the self-reinforcing nature of climate change,\u201d the tipping point may well have arrived, and we may be rapidly approaching the point of no return. Despite countless studies over the last half century warning of the catastrophic consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, many of which the government conducted, the government not only failed to act but also \u201caffirmatively promote[d] fossil fuel use in a host of ways.\u201d According to plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, our nation is crumbling\u2014at our government\u2019s own hand\u2014into a wasteland. In short, the government has directly facilitated an existential crisis to the country\u2019s perpetuity. In tossing this suit for want of standing, the majority concedes that the children and young adults who brought suit have presented enough to proceed to trial on the first two aspects of the inquiry (injury in fact and traceability). But the majority provides two-and-a-half reasons for concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries are not redressable. After detailing its \u201cskeptic[ism]\u201d that the relief sought could \u201csuffice to stop catastrophic climate change or even ameliorate [plaintiffs\u2019] injuries[,]\u201d the majority concludes that, at any rate, a court would lack any power to award it. In the majority\u2019s view, the relief sought is too great and unsusceptible to a judicially administrable standard. To explain why I disagree, I first step back to define the interest at issue. While standing operates as a threshold issue distinct from the merits of the claim, \u201cit often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\u201d Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975). And, unlike the majority, I believe the government has more than just a nebulous \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to preserve the Nation. The Constitution protects the right to \u201clife, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, [and] freedom of worship and assembly.\u201d W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943). Through \u201creasoned judgment,\u201d the Supreme Court has recognized that the Due Process Clause, enshrined in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, also safeguards certain \u201cinterests of the person so fundamental that the [government] must accord them its respect.\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2598 (2015). These include the right to marry, Loving v. Virginia , 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967), to maintain a family and rear children, M.L.B. v. S.L.J ., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996), and to pursue an occupation of one\u2019s choosing, Schware v. Bd. of Bar Exam ., 353 U.S. 232, 238\u201339 (1957). As fundamental rights, these \u201cmay not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\u201d Lucas v. Forty-Fourth Gen. Assembly , 377U.S. 713, 736 (1964) (quoting Barnette , 319 U.S. at 638). Some rights serve as the necessary predicate for others; their fundamentality therefore derives, at least in part, from the necessity to preserve other fundamental constitutional protections. Cf., e.g., Timbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 689 (2019) (deeming a right fundamental because its deprivation would \u201cundermine other constitutional liberties\u201d). For example, the right to vote \u201cis of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964). Because it is \u201cpreservative of all rights,\u201d the Supreme Court has long regarded suffrage \u201cas a fundamental political right.\u201d Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). This holds true even though the right to vote receives imperfect express protection in the Constitution itself: While several amendments proscribe the denial or abridgment of suffrage based on certain characteristics, the Constitution does not guarantee the right to vote ab initio . See U.S. Const. amends. XV, XIX, XXIV, XXVI; cf. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 4, cl. 1. Much like the right to vote, the perpetuity of the Republic occupies a central role in our constitutional structure as a \u201cguardian of all other rights,\u201d Plyler v. Doe , 457 U.S. 202, 217 n.15 (1982). \u201cCivil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the existence of an organized society . . . .\u201d Cox v. New Hampshire , 312 U.S. 569, 574 (1941); see also The Ku Klux Cases , 110 U.S. 651, 657\u201368 (1884). And, of course, in our system, that organized society consists of the Union. Without it, all the liberties protected by the Constitution to live the good life are meaningless. This observation is hardly novel. After securing independence, George Washington recognized that \u201cthe destiny of unborn millions\u201d rested on the fate of the new Nation, cautioning that \u201cwhatever measures have a tendency to dissolve the Union, or contribute to violate or lessen the Sovereign Authority, ought to be considered as hostile to the Liberty and Independency of America[.]\u201d President George Washington, Circular Letter of Farewell to the Army (June 8, 1783). Without the Republic\u2019s preservation, Washington warned, \u201cthere is a natural and necessary progression, from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of Tyranny; and that arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of Liberty abused to licentiousness.\u201d Id. When the Articles of the Confederation proved ill-fitting to the task of safeguarding the Union, the framers formed the Constitutional Convention with \u201cthe great object\u201d of \u201cpreserv[ing] and perpetuat[ing]\u201d the Union, for they believed that \u201cthe prosperity of America depended on its Union.\u201d The Federalist No. 2, at 19 (John Jay) (E. H. Scott ed., 1898); see also Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 24, 1787)4 (\u201cIt appeared to be the sincere and unanimous wish of the Convention to cherish and preserve the Union of the States.\u201d). In pressing New York to ratify the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton spoke of the gravity of the occasion: \u201cThe subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the Union, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed\u2014the fate of an empire, in many respects the most interesting in the world.\u201d The Federalist No. 1, at 11 (Alexander Hamilton) (E. H. Scott ed., 1898). In light of this animating principle, it is fitting that the Preamble declares that the Constitution is intended to secure \u201cthe Blessings of Liberty\u201d not just for one generation, but for all future generations\u2014our \u201cPosterity.\u201d The Constitution\u2019s structure reflects this perpetuity principle. See Alden v. Maine , 527 U.S. 706, 713 (1999) (examining how \u201c[v]arious textual provisions of the Constitution assume\u201d a structural principle). In taking the Presidential Oath, the Executive must vow to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 8, and the Take Care Clause obliges the President to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Likewise, though generally not separately enforceable, Article IV, Section 4 provides that the \u201cUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and . . . against domestic Violence.\u201d U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4; see also New York v. United States , 505 U.S. 144, 184\u201385 (1992). Less than a century after the country\u2019s founding, the perpetuity principle undergirding the Constitution met its greatest challenge. Faced with the South\u2019s secession, President Lincoln reaffirmed that the Constitution did not countenance its own destruction. \u201c[T]he Union of these States is perpetual[,]\u201d he reasoned in his First Inaugural Address, because \u201c[p]erpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.\u201d President Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address (Mar. 4, 1861). In justifying this constitutional principle, Lincoln drew from history, observing that \u201c[t]he Union is much older than the Constitution.\u201d Id . He reminded his fellow citizens, \u201cone of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \u2018to form a more perfect Union.\u2019\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (quoting U.S. Const. pmbl.). While secession manifested the existential threat most apparently contemplated by the Founders\u2014political dissolution of the Union\u2014the underlying principle applies equally to its physical destruction. This perpetuity principle does not amount to \u201ca right to live in a contaminant-free, healthy environment.\u201d Guertin v. Michigan , 912 F.3d 907, 922 (6th Cir. 2019). To be sure, the stakes can be quite high in environmental disputes, as pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths each year, not to mention disability and diminished quality of life.5 Many abhor living in a polluted environment, and some pay with their lives. But mine-run environmental concerns \u201cinvolve a host of policy choices that must be made by . . . elected representatives, rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of government[.]\u201d Collins v. City of Harker Heights , 503 U.S. 115, 129 (1992). The perpetuity principle is not an environmental right at all, and it does not task the courts with determining the optimal level of environmental regulation; rather, it prohibits only the willful dissolution of the Republic. That the principle is structural and implicit in our constitutional system does not render it any less enforceable. To the contrary, our Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]here are many [] constitutional doctrines that are not spelled out in the Constitution\u201d but are nonetheless enforceable as \u201chistorically rooted principle[s] embedded in the text and structure of the Constitution.\u201d Franchise Tax Bd. of California v. Hyatt , 139 S. Ct. 1485, 1498\u201399 (2019). For instance, the Constitution does not in express terms provide for judicial review, Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. 137, 176\u201377 (1803); sovereign immunity (outside of the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s explicit restriction), Alden , 527 U.S. at 735\u2013 36; the anticommandeering doctrine, Murphy v. NCAA , 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1477 (2018); or the regimented tiers of scrutiny applicable to many constitutional rights, see, e.g., Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 641\u201342 (1994). Yet these doctrines, as well as many other implicit principles, have become firmly entrenched in our constitutional landscape. And, in an otherwise justiciable case, a private litigant may seek to vindicate such structural principles, for they \u201cprotect the individual as well\u201d as the Nation. See Bond v. United States , 564 U.S. 211, 222, 225\u201326 (2011); INS. v. Chadha , 462 U.S. 919, 935\u201336 (1983). In Hyatt , for instance, the Supreme Court held that a state could not be sued in another state\u2019s courts without its consent. Although nothing in the text of the Constitution expressly forbids such suits, the Court concluded that they contravened \u201cthe \u2018implicit ordering of relationships within the federal system necessary to make the Constitution a workable governing charter and to give each provision within that document the full effect intended by the Framers.\u2019\u201d Hyatt , 139 S. Ct. at 1492 (quoting Nevada v. Hall , 440 U.S. 410, 433 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)). So too here. Nor can the perpetuity principle be rejected simply because the Court has not yet had occasion to enforce it as a limitation on government conduct. Only over time, as the Nation confronts new challenges, are constitutional principles tested. For instance, courts did not recognize the anticommandeering doctrine until the 1970s because \u201c[f]ederal commandeering of state governments [was] such a novel phenomenon.\u201d Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898, 925 (1997). And the Court did not recognize that cell-site data fell within the Fourth Amendment until 2018. In so holding, the Court rejected \u201ca \u2018mechanical interpretation\u2019 of the Fourth Amendment\u201d because \u201ctechnology has enhanced the Government\u2019s capacity to encroach upon areas normally guarded from inquisitive eyes[.]\u201d Carpenter v. United States , 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2214 (2018). Thus, it should come as no surprise that the Constitution\u2019s commitment to perpetuity only now faces judicial scrutiny, for never before has the United States confronted an existential threat that has not only gone unremedied but is actively backed by the government. The mere fact that we have alternative means to enforce a principle, such as voting, does not diminish its constitutional stature. Americans can vindicate federalism, separation of powers, equal protection, and voting rights through the ballot box as well, but that does not mean these constitutional guarantees are not independently enforceable. By its very nature, the Constitution \u201cwithdraw[s] certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.\u201d Barnette , 319 U.S. at 638. When fundamental rights are at stake, individuals \u201cneed not await legislative action.\u201d Obergefell , 135 S. Ct. at 2605. Indeed, in this sui generis circumstance, waiting is not an option. Those alive today are at perhaps the singular point in history where society (1) is scientifically aware of the impending climate crisis, and (2) can avoid the point of no return. And while democracy affords citizens the right \u201cto debate so they can learn and decide and then, through the political process, act in concert to try to shape the course of their own times[,]\u201d id. (quoting Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action , 572 U.S. 291, 312 (2014)), that process cannot override the laws of nature. Or, more colloquially, we can\u2019t shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. As the last fifty years have made clear, telling plaintiffs that they must vindicate their right to a habitable United States through the political branches will rightfully be perceived as telling them they have no recourse. The political branches must often realize constitutional principles, but in a justiciable case or controversy, courts serve as the ultimate backstop. To this issue, I turn next. Of course, \u201cit is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.\u201d Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996). So federal courts are not free to address every grievance. \u201cWhether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to obtain judicial resolution of that controversy is what has traditionally been referred to as the question of standing to sue.\u201d Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 727, 731\u201332 (1972). Standing is \u201ca doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy,\u201d developed to \u201censure that federal courts do not exceed their authority as it has been traditionally understood.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). A case is fit forjudicial determination only if the plaintiff has: \u201c(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992); then citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv . (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180\u201381 (2000)). As to the first two elements, my colleagues and I agree: Plaintiffs present adequate evidence at this pre-trial stage to show particularized, concrete injuries to legally-protected interests, and they present further evidence to raise genuine disputes as to whether those injuries\u2014at least in substantial part\u2014are fairly traceable to the government\u2019s conduct at issue. See Maj. Op. at 18\u201321. Because I find that plaintiffs have also established the third prong for redressability, I conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 legal stake in this action suffices to invoke the adjudicative powers of the federal bench. \u201cRedressability\u201d concerns whether a federal court is capable of vindicating a plaintiff\u2019s legal rights. I agree with the majority that our ability to provide redress is animated by two inquiries, one of efficacy and one of power. Maj. Op. at 21 (citing M.S. v. Brown , 902 F.3d 1076, 1083 (9th Cir. 2018)). First, as a causal matter, is a court order likely to actually remediate the plaintiffs\u2019 injury? If so, does the judiciary have the constitutional authority to levy such an order? Id. Addressing the first question, my colleagues are skeptical that curtailing the government\u2019s facilitation of fossil-fuel extraction and combustion will ameliorate the plaintiffs\u2019 harms. See Maj. Op. at 22\u201325. I am not, as the nature of the injury at stake informs the effectiveness of the remedy. See Warth , 422 U.S. at 500. As described above, the right at issue is not to be entirely free from any climate change. Rather, plaintiffs have a constitutional right to be free from irreversible and catastrophic climate change . Plaintiffs have begun to feel certain concrete manifestations of this violation, ripening their case for litigation, but such prefatory harms are just the first barbs of an ongoing injury flowing from an ongoing violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights. The bulk of the injury is yet to come. Therefore, practical redressability is not measured by our ability to stop climate change in its tracks and immediately undo the injuries that plaintiffs suffer today\u2014 an admittedly tall order; it is instead measured by our ability to curb by some meaningful degree what the record shows to be an otherwise inevitable march to the point of no return. Hence, the injury at issue is not climate change writ large; it is climate change beyond the threshold point of no return. As we approach that threshold, the significance of every emissions reduction is magnified. The majority portrays any relief we can offer as just a drop in the bucket. See Maj. Op. at 22\u201325. In a previous generation, perhaps that characterization would carry the day and we would hold ourselves impotent to address plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. But we are perilously close to an overflowing bucket. These final drops matter. A lot. Properly framed, a court order\u2014even one that merely postpones the day when remedial measures become insufficiently effective\u2014would likely have a real impact on preventing the impending cataclysm. Accordingly,I conclude that the court could do something to help the plaintiffs before us. And \u201csomething\u201d is all that standing requires. In Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court explicitly held that a non-negligible reduction in emissions\u2014there, by regulating vehicles emissions\u2014satisfied the redressability requirement of Article III standing: While it may be true that regulating motor-vehicle emissions will not by itself reverse global warming, it by no means follows that we lack jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it. Because of the enormity of the potential consequences associated with manmade climate change, the fact that the effectiveness of a remedy might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant. Nor is it dispositive that developing countries such as China and India are poised to increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the next century: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere. \u2026The risk of catastrophic harm, though remote, is nevertheless real. In other words, under Article III, a perceptible reduction in the advance of climate change is sufficient to redress a plaintiff\u2019s climate change-induced harms. Full stop. The majority dismisses this precedent because Massachusetts v. EPA involved a procedural harm, whereas plaintiffs here assert a purely substantive right. Maj. Op. at 24. But this difference in posture does not affect the outcome. While the redressability requirement is relaxed in the procedural context, that does not mean (1) we must engage in a similarly relaxed analysis whenever we invoke Massachusetts v. EPA or (2) we cannot rely on Massachusetts v. EPA \u2019s substantive examination of the relationship between government action and the course of climate change. Accordingly, here, we do not consider the likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail in any newly-awarded agency procedure, nor whether granting access to that procedure will redress plaintiffs\u2019 injury. Cf. Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. at 517\u201318; Lujan , 504 U.S. at 572 n.7. Rather, we assume plaintiffs will prevail\u2014removing the procedural link from the causal chain\u2014and we resume our traditional analysis to determine whether the desired outcome would in fact redress plaintiffs\u2019 harms. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the remaining substantive inquiry w as w het her red ucing emissions from fossil-fuel combustion would likely ameliorate climate change-induced injuries despite the global nature of climate change (regardless of whether renewed procedures were themselves likely to mandate such lessening). The Supreme Court unambiguously answered that question in the affirmative. That holding squarely applies to the instant facts, rendering the absence of a procedural right here irrelevant. The majority laments that it cannot step into the shoes of the political branches, see Maj. Op. at 32, but appears ready to yield even if those branches walk the Nation over a cliff. This deference-to-a-fault promotes separation of powers to the detriment of our countervailing constitutional mandate to intervene where the political branches run afoul of our foundational principles. Our tripartite system go government is often and aptly described as one of \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d The doctrine of standing preserves balance among the branches by keeping separate questions of general governance and those of specific legal entitlement. But the doctrine of judicial review compels federal courts to fashion and effectuate relief to right legal wrongs, even when\u2014as frequently happens\u2014it requires that we instruct the other branches as to the constitutional limitations on their power. Indeed, sometimes \u201cthe [judicial and governance] roles briefly and partially coincide when a court, in granting relief against actual harm that has been suffered, . . . orders the alteration of an institutional organization or procedure that causes the harm.\u201d Lewis, 518 U.S. at 350; cf. Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc. , 454 U.S. 464, 474 (1982) (\u201cProper regard for the complex nature of our constitutional structure requires neither that the Judicial Branch shrink from a confrontation with the other two coequal branches of the Federal Government, nor that it hospitably accept for adjudication claims of constitutional violation by other branches of government where the claimant has not suffered cognizable injury.\u201d). In my view, this Court must confront and reconcile this tension before deciding that thorny questions of standing preclude review in this case. And faithful application of our history and precedents reveals that a failure to do so leads to the wrong result. Taking the long (but essential) way around, I begin first by acknowledging explicitly what the majority does not mention: our history plainly establishes an ambient presumption of judicial review to which separation-of- powers concerns provide a rebuttal under limited circumstances. Few would contest that \u201c[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department\u201d to curb acts of the political branches that contravene those fundamental tenets of American life so dear as to be constitutionalized and thus removed from political whims. See Marbury , 5U.S. at 177\u201378. This presumptive authority entails commensurat e pow er t o grant appropriat e red ress, as recognized in Marbury , \u201cwhich effectively place[s] upon those who would deny the existence of an effective legal remedy the burden of showing why their case was special.\u201d Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1874 (2017) (Breyer, J., dissenting). That is, \u201cthere must be something \u2018peculiar\u2019 (i.e., special) about a case that warrants \u2018excluding the injured party from legal redress and placing it within that class of cases which come under the description of damnum absque injuria\u2014a loss without an injury.\u2019\u201d Id . (cleaned up) (quoting Marbury , 5 U.S. at 163\u201364). In sum, although it is the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish injury in fact, causation, and redressability, it is the government\u2019s burden to establish why this otherwise-justiciable controversy implicates grander separation-of-powers concerns not already captured by those requirements. We do not otherwise abdicate our duty to enforce constitutional rights. Without explicitly laying this groundwork, the majority nonetheless suggests that this case is \u201cspecial\u201d\u2014and beyond our redress\u2014because plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief requires (1) the messy business of evaluating competing policy considerations to steer the government away from fossil fuels and (2) the intimidating task of supervising implementation over many years, if not decades. See Maj. Op. at 25\u201327. I admit these are daunting tasks, but we are constitutionally empowered to undertake them. There is no justiciability exception for cases of great complexity and magnitude. I readily concede that courts must on occasion refrain from answering those questions that are truly reserved for the political branches, even where core constitutional precepts are implicated. This deference is known as the \u201cpolitical question doctrine,\u201d and its applicability is governed by a well-worn multifactor test that counsels judicial deference where there is: [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department [ 2 ] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question. Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962) [...] Here, confronted by difficult questions on the constitutionality of policy, the majority creates a minefield of politics en route to concluding that we cannot adjudicate this suit. And the majority\u2019s map for navigating that minefield is Rucho v. Common Cause , 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019), an inapposite case about gerrymandering. My colleagues conclude that climate change is too political for the judiciary to touch by likening it to the process of political representatives drawing political maps to elect other political representatives. I vehemently disagree. The government does not address on appeal the district judge\u2019s reasoning that the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth Baker factors do not apply here. Neither does the majority rely on any of these factors in its analysis. In relevant part, I find the opinion below both thorough and well-reasoned, and I adopt its conclusions. I note, however, that the absence of the first Baker factor\u2014whether the Constitution textually delegates the relevant subject matter to another branch\u2014is especially conspicuous. As the district judge described, courts invoke this factor only where the Constitution makes an unambiguous commitment of responsibility to one branch of government. Very few cases turn on this factor, and almost all that do pertain to two areas of constitutional authority: foreign policy and legislative proceedings. See, e.g., Marshall Islands , 865 F.3d at 1200\u201301 (treaty enforcement); Corrie , 503 F.3d at 983 (military aid); Nixon , 506 U.S. at 234 (impeachment proceedings); see also Davis v. Passman , 442 U.S. 228, 235 n.11 (1979) (\u201c[J]udicial review of congressional employment d ecisions is constitutionally limited only by the reach of the Speech or Debate Clause[,] . . . [which is] a paradigm example of a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of [an] issue to a coordinate political department.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry , 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2086 (2015) (\u201cThe text and structure of the Constitution grant the President the power to recognize foreign nations and governments.\u201d). Since this matter has been under submission, the Supreme Court cordoned off an additional area from judicial review based in part on a textual commitment to another branch: partisan gerrymandering. See Rucho , 139 S. Ct. at 2494\u201396.12 Obviously, the Constitution does not explicitly address climate change. But neither does climate change implicitly fall within a recognized political-question area. As the district judge described, the questions of energy policy at stake here may have rippling effects on foreign policy considerations, but that is not enough to wholly exempt the subject matter from our review. See Juliana v. United States , 217 F. Supp. 3d 1224, 1238 (D. Or. 2016) (\u201c[U]nlike the decisions to go to war, take action to keep a particular foreign leader in power, or give aid to another country, climate change policy is not inherently, or even primarily, a foreign policy decision.\u201d); see also Baker , 369 U.S. at 211 (\u201c[I]t is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.\u201d). Without endorsement from the constitutional text, the majority\u2019s theory is grounded exclusively in the second Baker factor: a (supposed) lack of clear judicial standards for shaping relief. Relying heavily on Rucho , the majority contends the we cannot formulate standards(1)to determine what relief \u201cis sufficient to remediate the claimed constitutional violation\u201d or (2) to \u201csupervise[] or enforce[]\u201d such relief. Maj. Op. at 29. The first point is a red herring. Plaintiffs submit ample evidence that there is a discernable \u201ctipping point\u201d at which the government\u2019s conduct turns from facilitating mere pollution to inducing an unstoppable cataclysm in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Indeed, the majority itself cites plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that \u201catmospheric carbon levels of 350 parts per million are necessary to stabilize the climate.\u201d Id. at 24. This clear line stands in stark contrast to Rucho , which held that\u2014even assuming an excessively partisan gerrymander was unconstitutional\u2014no standards exist by which to determine when a rights violation has even occurred. There, \u201c[t]he central problem [wa]s not determining whether a jurisdiction has engaged in partisan gerrymandering. It [was] determining when gerrymandering has gone too far.\u201d Rucho , 139 S. Ct. at 2497 (internal quotation marks omitted). [\u2026] Here, the right at issue is fundamentally one of a discernable standard: the amount of fossil-fuel emissions that will irreparably devastate our Nation. That amount can be established by scientific evidence like that proffered by the plaintiffs. Moreover, we need not definitively determine that standard today. Rather, we need conclude only that plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether such an amount can possibly be determined as a matter of scientific fact. Plaintiffs easily clear this bar. Of course, plaintiffs will have to carry their burden of proof to establish this fact in order to prevail at trial, but that issue is not before us. We must not get ahead of ourselves. The procedural posture of this case also informs the question of oversight and enforcement. It appears the majority\u2019s real concerns lie not in the judiciary\u2019s ability to draw a line between lawful and unlawful conduct, but in our ability to equitably walk the government back from that line without wholly subverting the authority of our coequal branches. My colleagues take great issue with plaintiffs\u2019 request for a \u201cplan\u201d to reduce fossil-fuel emissions. I am not so concerned. At this stage, we need not promise plaintiffs the moon (or, more apropos, the earth in a habitable state). For purposes of standing, we need hold only that the trial court could fashion some sort of meaningful relief should plaintiffs prevail on the merits. Nor would any such remedial \u201cplan\u201d necessarily require the courts to muck around in policymaking to an impermissible degree; the scope and number of policies a court would have to reform to provide relief is irrelevant to the second Baker factor, which asks only if there are judicially discernable standards to guide that reformation. Indeed, our history is no stranger to widespread, programmatic changes in government functions ushered in by the judiciary\u2019s commitment to requiring adherence to the Constitution. Upholding the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, for example, the Court ordered the overhaul of prisons in the Nation\u2019s most populous state. See Brown v. Plata , 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (\u201cCourts may not allow constitutional violations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison administration.\u201d) And in its finest hour, the Court mandated the racial integration of every public school\u2014state and federal\u2014in the Nation, vindicating the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection under the law. See Brown v. Bd. of Educ . (Brown I) , 347 U.S. 483 (1954); Bolling v. Sharpe , 347 U.S. 497 (1954). In the school desegregation cases, the Supreme Court was explicitly unconcerned with the fact that crafting relief would require individualized review of thousands of state and local policies that facilitated segregation. Rather, a unanimous Court held that the judiciary could work to dissemble segregation over time while remaining cognizant of the many public interests at stake: To effectuate [the plaintiffs\u2019] interest[s] may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in [ Brown I ]. Courts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. . . . [T]he courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner. The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable date. To that end, the courts may consider problems related to ad minist rat ion, arising f rom t he physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems. Brown v. Bd. of Educ. ( Brown II ), 349 U.S. 294, 300\u201301 (1955). As we are all too aware, it took decades to even partially realize Brown\u2019 s promise, but the slow churn of constitutional vindication did not dissuade the Brown Court, and it should not dissuade us here. Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a \u201cplan\u201d is neither novel nor judicially incognizable. Rather, consistent with our historical practices, their request is a recognition that remedying decades of institutionalized violations may take some time. Here, too, decelerating from our path toward cataclysm will undoubtedly require \u201celimination of a variety of obstacles.\u201d Those obstacles may be great in number, novelty, and magnitude, but there is no indication that they are devoid of discernable standards. Busing mandates, facilities allocation, and district-drawing were all \u201ccomplex policy decisions\u201d faced by post- Brown trial courts, see Maj. Op. at 25, and I have no doubt that disentangling the government from promotion of fossil fuels will take an equally deft judicial hand. Mere complexity, however, does not put the issue out of the courts\u2019 reach. Neither the government nor the majority has articulated why the courts could not weigh scientific and prudential considerations\u2014as we often do\u2014to put the government on a path to constitutional compliance. The majority also expresses concern that any remedial plan would require us to compel \u201cthe adoption of a comprehensive scheme to decrease fossil fuel emissions and combat climate change[.]\u201d Id. at 25. Even if the operative complaint is fairly read as requesting an affirmative scheme to addressall drivers of climate change, however caused, see id. at 23 n.6., such an overbroad request does not doom our ability to redress those drivers implicated by the conduct at issue here. Courts routinely grant plaintiffs less than the full gamut of requested relief, and our inability to compel legislation that addresses emissions beyond the scope of this case\u2014such as those purely in the private sphere or within the control of foreign governments\u2014speaks nothing to our ability to enjoin the government from exercising its discretion in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. In sum, resolution of this action requires answers only to scientific questions, not political ones. And plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence demonstrating their entitlement to have those questions addressed at trial in a court of law. As discussed above, the majority reaches the opposite conclusion not by marching purposefully through the Baker factors, which carve out a narrow set of nonjusticiable political cases, but instead by broadly invoking Rucho in a manner that would cull from our dockets any case that presents administrative issues \u201ctoo difficult for the judiciary to manage.\u201d Maj. Op. at 28. That simply is not the test. Difficult questions are not necessarily political questions and, beyond reaching the wrong conclusion in this case, the majority\u2019s application of Rucho threatens to eviscerate judicial review in a swath of complicated but plainly apolitical contexts. Rucho \u2019s limitations should be apparent on the face of that opinion. Rucho addresses the political process itself, namely whether the metastasis of partisan politics has unconstitutionally invaded the drawing of political districts within states. Indeed, the Rucho opinion characterizes the issue before it as a request for the Court to reallocate political powerbetweenthemajorparties. Rucho ,139S.Ct.at2502, 2507, 2508. Baker factors aside, Rucho surely confronts fundamentally \u201cpolitical\u201d questions in the common sense of the term. Nothing about climate change, however, is inherently political. The majority is correct that redressing climate change will require consideration of scientific, economic, energy, and other policy factors. But that endeavor does not implicate the way we elect representatives, assign governmental powers, or otherwise structure our polity. Regardless, we do not limit our jurisdiction based on common parlance. Instead, legal and constitutional principles define the ambit of our authority. In the present case, the Baker factors provide the relevant guide and further distinguish Rucho . As noted above, Rucho \u2019s holding that policing partisan gerrymandering is beyond the courts\u2019 competence rests heavily on the first Baker factor, i.e., the textual and historical delegation of electoral-district drawing to state legislatures. The Rucho Court decided it could not discern mathematical standards to navigate a way out of that particular political thicket. It did not, however, hold that mathematical (or scientific) difficulties in creating appropriate standards divest jurisdiction in any context. Such an expansive reading of Rucho would permit the \u201cpolitical question\u201d exception to swallow the rule. Global warming is certainly an imposing conundrum, but so are diversity in higher education, the intersection between prenatal life and maternal health, the role of religion in civic society, and many other social concerns. Cf. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke , 438 U.S. 265, 360 (1978) (\u201c[T]he line between honest and thoughtful appraisal of the effects of past discrimination and paternalistic stereotyping is not so clear[.]\u201d); Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 871 (1992) (stating that Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 (1973), involved the \u201cdifficult question\u201d of determining the \u201cweight to be given [the] state interest\u201d in light of the \u201cstrength of the woman\u2019s [privacy] interest\u201d); Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass\u2019n , 139 S. Ct. 2067, 2094 (2019) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that determining the constitutionality of a large cross\u2019s presence on public land was \u201cdifficult because it represents a clash of genuine and important interests\u201d). These issues may not have been considered within the purview of the judicial branch had the Court imported wholesale Rucho \u2019s \u201cmanageable standards\u201d analysis even in the absence of Rucho \u2019s inherently political underpinnings. Beyond the outcome of the instant case, I fear that the majority\u2019s holding strikes a powerful blow to our ability to hear important cases of widespread concern. To be sure, unless there is a constitutional violation, courts should allow the democratic and political processes to perform their functions. And while all would now readily agree that the 91 years between the Emancipation Proclamation and the decision in Brown v. Board was too long, determining when a court must step in to protect fundamental rights is not an exact science. In this case, my colleagues say that time is \u201cnever\u201d; I say it is now. Were we addressing a matter of social injustice, one might sincerely lament any delay, but take solace that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d The denial of an individual, constitutional right\u2014though grievous and harmful\u2014can be corrected in the future, even if it takes 91 years. And that possibility provides hope for future generations. Where is the hope in today\u2019s decision? Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on science, specifically, an impending point of no return. If plaintiffs\u2019 fears, backed by the government\u2019s own studies , prove true, history will not judge us kindly. When the seas envelop our coastal cities, fires and droughts haunt our interiors, and storms ravage everything between, those remaining will ask: Why did so many do so little? I would hold that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the government\u2019s conduct, have articulated claims under the Constitution, and have presented sufficient evidence to press those claims at trial. I would therefore affirm the district court. With respect, I dissent.","headline":"A Climate-Lawsuit Dissent That Changed My Mind","article_name":605296.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/read-fiery-dissent-childrens-climate-case\/605296\/","date_published":"2020-01-22 20:12:50","article_length":57812,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:25.950888","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2020\/01\/read-fiery-dissent-childrens-climate-case\/605296\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A generation facing an intractable problem debates whether to bring a new generation into the world. Miley Cyrus vowed not to have a baby on a \u201cpiece-of-shit planet.\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mused in an Instagram video about whether it\u2019s still okay to have children. Polls suggest that a third or more of Americans younger than 45 either don\u2019t have children or expect to have fewer than they might otherwise because they are worried about climate change. Millennials and Gen Z are not the first generations to face the potential of imminent, catastrophic, irreversible change to the world they will inherit. But, it seems, they are the first to seriously entertain whether that means they should stop having children . This question tends to cleave people into two camps: those who think considering climate change is reasonable and necessary when making decisions about having children, and those who find this premise unthinkable. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in caring about our climate \u2026 and asking a legitimate question about doing away with the human race,\u201d the conservative television personality Abby Huntsman said on The View of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments. At the margins of the climate movement, that\u2019s basically what people are proposing: A very small number of women in the United Kingdom have launched a \u201cbirth strike\u201d as a response to ecological devastation. But the question can be more nuanced than \u201cWill you or won\u2019t you?\u201d Meghan Kallman and Josephine Ferorelli started hosting house parties and collecting testimonies about this topic roughly half a decade ago, in a project called Conceivable Future . They wanted people, and especially women, to be able to share deeply held and often silent worries, and to connect with the climate issue from a personal perspective. I talked with Kallman and Ferorelli about why the climate crisis is different from any other crisis in human history, whether they\u2019re planning to have kids, and how that\u2019s related to their hope for the future. Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Emma Green: Who tends to gravitate toward this question about how climate change should affect childbearing? Josephine Ferorelli: You know, it\u2019s been an ongoing surprise who this resonates with and who it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m aware of this being really present in the reproductive-justice movement. In conversations with people of color, climate is compounded with a lot of other threats to any children that they might wish to have. The climate crisis is only one way our leadership shows their hand\u2014that they don\u2019t put the health and safety of us or our potential children ahead of quarterly profits. I think our generation is unique in the number of pressures weighing down on it. Meghan Kallman: The conversation is, in my experience, deeply gendered. Women\u2014people who are raised women especially, but all women\u2014face a lot more anxiety around having children, being parents, and, specifically, being mothers. Men who don\u2019t have children or who choose to parent unconventionally are considered whole people. Women who are not having children or who are questioning their own desire to have kids are judged very harshly and much differently than men are. Green: But are there shared characteristics along lines of education? Do people share a certain progressive political outlook? Kallman: They tend to be at least college-educated. And they tend to be, certainly, pro-choice. For the most part, they\u2019re on the left of the political spectrum. They\u2019re certainly, on the whole, younger. Our house parties have been not exclusively white, but they\u2019re pretty white. Ferorelli: One thing that revealed itself to us pretty early is that, for a lot of white, middle-class people, climate is this stunner of an issue. It\u2019s the first time a lot of us have noticed that our well-being is not cherished by our leadership. But for almost everybody else, demographically, that\u2019s not a surprise. So some of the conversations we\u2019ve been having with people are just reckoning with this idea that if you decide to have children, you\u2019re doing it against odds, in the face of harm. Those are the conditions that people of color who have children in America have had from the beginning . Read: Climate policy can help avert modern liberalism\u2019s \u2018doom loop\u2019 Green: I\u2019d like you to unpack that a little bit more\u2014what that means for you. Both of you, I assume, identify as white women. Meghan, you have one of the fanciest degrees the world has to offer: a Ph.D. from an Ivy League university. In general, we live in a country with unprecedented historical wealth and vast technological innovation, and you are both in positions to benefit from that. So I guess I wonder: Why you? Why would you be the people to not have children to try to answer the vast moral challenge that is climate change? Kallman: First of all, neither of us have chosen to have children or to not have children. We\u2019re both in our 30s. We both have a little bit of time to make this decision. And for both of us, there are personal considerations. There is a really, really gross class\u2014and by extension, race\u2014underpinning of the premise that you should have children. Your children will save X. Your children will invent the cure for Y. That comment seems to mean: Because you are privileged, because you are white, because you are educated, your kids are more valuable and therefore you should have them (a) because you\u2019re a woman, and (b) because they\u2019ll fix everything. The stuff to unpack in there is dense as a brick, and it\u2019s really destructive. The point is that everybody\u2019s kids deserve a chance at a healthy life. Green: The question I\u2019m trying to get at is different. Obviously, no one will escape the effects of climate change. But some people are globally situated such that climate change is an immediate problem: It is already affecting their lives or will imminently have catastrophic effects on their lives. Take women who live in coastal Bangladesh. It is almost guaranteed that in 20 years, what is now Bangladesh is going to be a significantly smaller geographic territory than it is today. People are already being displaced there because of climate change. I assume, for you all, that kind of immediacy does not exist. Women in coastal Bangladesh are having children. Based on what you\u2019ve said in the past, I don\u2019t think that you would ever tell them not to have kids\u2014and in fact, doing so would be offensive and reminiscent of population-control efforts of the past. How do you reconcile your questions about having children with the fact that the problem is so much more immediate for other people who live in other places, who are still having kids? Ferorelli: There are a lot of moral evasions that people practice in order to not engage with the climate crisis as an issue. It\u2019s a habit that people have developed in this privileged world to say, \u201cOh, these are first-world problems.\u201d It\u2019s a way to discredit concern but also to protect inaction. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have it that bad; climate change doesn\u2019t affect me personally. Do I have a right to talk about this?\u201d I think that a lot of people stall out at that point. The mis-framing of our work as \u201cThese are eccentric women who are vowing not to have children, and they\u2019re hysterical\u201d\u2014that was something we got a lot in the early days. Some groups have organized around a pledge not to have children, and I understand why they do that, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve ever done. What we\u2019re saying is: There\u2019s a generation of people who are looking at the world around us and saying, \u201cOh shit. It might not be safe for me to have a child,\u201d or, \u201cOh shit, if I commit to activism, I won\u2019t have time to parent a child during the next decade.\u201d To us, it has no political significance whether you have one child, five children, or none. The political significance comes from seeing the threats, naming the threats, and organizing to address them in a systemic way. Read: The rebirth of America\u2019s pro-natalist movement Green: But for a lot of people, it\u2019s not obvious why the natural response to looming climate disaster is to consider not having kids or limiting the number of kids you have. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cA + B = C.\u201d When I see people write about this topic, they say things like, \u201cOh, you know, during the Thirty Years\u2019 War in Europe, when something like one-third of the population in that area died, people had babies, so why stop now? People have always had babies, even during horrible times.\u201d Why do you think taking climate change seriously necessarily leads to a conversation about personal reproductive choices? Kallman: There are two concerns that people at our house parties frequently show up with. One is: What kind of harm will my child do to the world? The number of diapers these kids produce would eventually circle the Earth; they\u2019ll create X tons of carbon, X tons of trash. And then the other question is: What kind of harm would a hotter and less stable and more potentially violent world do to my kid? It\u2019s thinking about entering this system that feels so very fragile and so very unstable. We\u2019re living in a time of entwined, unending crisis. Ferorelli: I\u2019ve always been pretty sensitive to climate anxiety. I can\u2019t remember a time when the warming climate wasn\u2019t a part of my considerations about my future. It weighed heavily on any future I could imagine for myself. It\u2019s true, what you\u2019re saying: This is not obvious to everybody. But our initial organizing efforts were mostly with people already doing climate work, and the No. 1 thing we were hearing from all of them was like, \u201cOh my God, I thought I was the only person who felt this way.\u201d Kallman: We had a series of disappointing conversations with women who did activism in the \u201970s and \u201980s. We thought they were people who had similar concerns and similar fears, and that we would find natural allies there. Instead we found a series of comments more or less akin to, \u201cOh, we had kids and it was fine. If you want to do it, just do it. It will work out.\u201d There is a lot of paralyzing guilt and fear from people with different ages and social positions, classes, races, etc. And there\u2019s a really strong sense of intergenerational grief and tension around this. There are folks who are grandparent-age who are watching their adult children struggle with this and feeling the grief and sorrow and guilt of the whole system. Green: Meghan, I saw a clip of a speech you gave in which you talked about a gruesome process of reading the news every day, searching for some sign that things are looking up enough that you might feel confident enough to have a child. What would have to change for you to have kids? Is there any point in the future where you could imagine feeling confident having a child? Kallman: Well, I think that\u2019s not the point, right? For me, at least, it\u2019s not about if you\u2019re ever comfortable enough. I can\u2019t promise any child a safe future. I want to be really clear that my decision around this is unmade. What I want to see is a sign that people are taking this seriously\u2014that there is a good-faith, collaborative effort to make the world safe. Is there a threshold? No. For every single person, this is a complex assessment of partner or partners and financial security, age, whatever. To me, it\u2019s not a useful framing, either to myself or to say out loud to you: \u201cIs there a threshold? What\u2019s the threshold?\u201d We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re already in the age of uncertainty. The question is: Can we use the collective power that we have to push that uncertainty into the best possible outcome? Ferorelli: People who have children are doing so because they know they have to have hope located in the future. It\u2019s a way of staking a claim in the future that you care about on a really deep level. There is no one right outcome. If we were advocating an outcome, I think we would have closed up shop years ago. We\u2019re advocating broad participation in a conversation that gets people to engage with the levers of power. Kallman: It\u2019s the fact of the question, not the answer. The outcome doesn\u2019t matter in any individual case. Green: This may seem like a non sequitur, but are either of you religious? I\u2019m wondering because being religious or not strikes me as a big part of how people experience hope. Some religious outlooks involve a notion of hope, or even of salvation, that comes from beyond just our life on Earth. And I think that creates a definitive divide in terms of how people view the future and how they experience moral demands on their lives. Ferorelli: I think it\u2019s a really beautiful question. I tend to find philosophical meaning in stuff that a lot of people experience as prosaic. I teach yoga, and I find that my experience of my physical body connects me to the world around me. There\u2019s an idea of God in my life, and the succession of generations, and the ongoing power of life. I don\u2019t believe in a literal reincarnation, but I do believe in a woven thing that is life, that makes us deeply, intrinsically responsible for each other and what comes next. I feel often that I\u2019m coming up short that way, and I feel like having these conversations about a future we can imagine together is a spiritual practice. Kallman: That is really beautifully said. I think for me, being alive is a practice of faith. Getting up and doing my work for the day and seeking out work that needs doing\u2014these are the most holy things that I experience. But it\u2019s not framed as a religious undertaking in my head. Green: Do you all feel hopeful when you think about the future? Kallman: Rebecca Solnit has a definition of hope as living in the unstuck place between optimism and pessimism where action is possible. Optimists think everything\u2019s going to be fine, no matter what happens, and they excuse themselves from action. And pessimists think we\u2019re fucked no matter what happens, and they excuse themselves from action. But hope lives in the unstuck middle place where agency is possible. I believe that what I do matters. So, by that definition, yes, I feel hopeful.","headline":"A World Without Children","article_name":620032.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2021\/09\/millennials-babies-climate-change\/620032\/","date_published":"2021-09-20 12:45:00","article_length":14081,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:26.199092","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2021\/09\/millennials-babies-climate-change\/620032\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"A pair of authors tries to maintain optimism about the world\u2019s changing landscapes\u2014but at what cost? In October, the residents of Newtok, Alaska, are expected to begin relocating because of climate change. And it\u2019s not just the people who are moving. The town is packing up everything\u2014including its school and airport \u2014and starting over on higher ground nine miles away. Sitting between two rivers on the state\u2019s southwestern coast, Newtok voted to move in 1996 , but governmental red tape and the project\u2019s high cost, more than $100 million, have contributed to the delay. As rising tides claim their land and record-breaking heat melts the permafrost beneath their homes, Newtok\u2019s 354 residents hope to complete their move by 2023. \u201cWe cannot wait anymore,\u201d the village\u2019s relocation coordinator told Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in August . Residents of other Alaskan towns and villages may soon be saying something similar, if they aren\u2019t already. Ninety-two miles east of Newtok, the 350 people who live in Napakiak are retreating from the Kuskokwim River, moving back their houses and other properties one by one from the eroding riverbank. Twice they have had to move the village cemetery. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant race against time, and right now the local grocery store, the fire station, and a city building are top of the list for relocation,\u201d a city-council member told the news agency AFP earlier this year . He added: \u201cWho knows what we are going to face in the next 10 years.\u201d The U.S. government\u2019s 2018 National Climate Assessment provided some idea , finding that 49.4 million \u201chousing units\u201d are located within shoreline communities across the country and that flooding \u201cfrom rising sea levels and storms is likely to destroy, or make unsuitable for use, billions of dollars of property by the middle of this century.\u201d Amid this destruction, a pair of new books suggests, may lie the secret to surviving it. In Surfacing , the Scottish essayist and poet Kathleen Jamie recounts her 2014 visit to Quinhagak, a coastal village of some 700 people located south of Napakiak. Five years earlier, while watching the Bering Sea swallow their land, creep closer to their homes, and threaten their community, Quinhagak\u2019s residents, most of them indigenous Yup\u2019iks, invited Rick Knecht, an archaeologist from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, to help them preserve what the water was taking away. Jamie reports that that erosion of a mile-long stretch of beach had revealed a 500-year-old village filled with Yup\u2019ik artifacts: \u201cline weights, harpoon heads, jewelry, wooden arrow-shafts, fishing weights, darts, models of animals, even ceremonial dance-masks, ritually broken after use.\u201d The discovery of these objects soon led to a renewed interest among the Quinhagak community about a way of life that had all but been forgotten. Before Jamie joined Knecht in Alaska, the archaeologist had told her that the site, named Nunallaq\u2014or \u201cOld Village\u201d\u2014\u201cwas revitalizing a damaged culture\u201d and \u201cdeveloping resilience and confidence\u201d among Quinhagak\u2019s residents. Warren Jones, the former president of the village corporation that owns the land in Quinhagak and most of the businesses that operate on it, tells Jamie how the dig inspired the first ceremonial dance in the village in a hundred years. Jones credits interest in Knecht\u2019s work to an increase in young Quinhagaks attending college, and believes what\u2019s happening there can show other Alaskan villages how a return to traditional ways of life can prepare them for the future. As one village elder tells Jamie during a discussion about hunting, \u201cWe gotta remember . If the planes stop flying and no food comes in, we gotta remember how to live.\u201d With Surfacing , Jamie doesn\u2019t join the chorus of voices calling for immediate action to prevent the effects of climate change from getting worse. She admits to feeling \u201cpowerless to resist\u201d the \u201cglobal forces and corporations\u201d blamed for the crisis. She can\u2019t, however, be accused of throwing in with the climate defeatists . Surfacing is a work of cautious optimism, with the author occasionally tilting too far toward wide-eyed hope. \u201cIf you imagine all the incidents the people here spoke of,\u201d she writes of Quinhagak, \u201call the looking and listening, the stories and encounters, remembered and repeated and layered over thousands of years, you might indeed come to know your own backyard. And how it might help you.\u201d Such stories are not, of course, found only in Alaska. Later in the book, Jamie spends time at an archaeological site named the Links of Noltland in her native Scotland. Buried for 5,000 years, the site is home to a recently exposed seaside settlement from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. As steady winds erode human remains and other evidence of communities that existed on the spot for 700 years, archaeologists race to save as much of it as they can. The subsistence farmers who lived here, Jamie writes, practiced \u201ca way of life that bound you inescapably.\u201d More than once, archaeologists tell her that these people \u201cjust got on with it\u201d\u2014the business of living. \u201cDoes this matter, is the question,\u201d Jamie wonders. \u201cDo we want to know how it was to be human, here, five thousand years ago? Do we want to know where we\u2019re coming from as we cruise into the future? What we were, or might be again? How we \u2018engaged,\u2019 if that\u2019s the word, how we configured our relationship with the rest of the natural world, with the planet.\u201d Jamie appears content to let the reader answer these questions, and she moves on to essays about losing her parents, her bout with cancer, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. For Terry Tempest Williams, there is no moving on from such questions. The Utah-based conservationist\u2019s new book, Erosion: Essays of Undoing , reads like a longer, louder, and less searching book than Jamie\u2019s. \u201cWithout a respect for origins,\u201d Williams declares, \u201cthe human spirit falters.\u201d In her impassioned collection of essays, poems, and interviews dating back to 2012, Williams returns often to the idea that in order to adapt to the climate crisis, everyone will need to understand \u201cwhat indigenous communities have always known, and are increasingly willing to share\u2014that we are one with the land, not apart from it.\u201d The veteran nature writer Barry Lopez makes a similar argument in his recent, career-spanning book Horizon , and like him, Williams understands that her observations\u2014and, ultimately, her faith in humanity and optimism about its future\u2014come from a place of privilege. While everyone is experiencing the effects of climate change, it\u2019s easy to write \u201cOur undoing is also the making of our becoming\u201d when the ocean isn\u2019t lapping at your front door. \u201cI have the privilege of looking forward,\u201d Williams admits in Erosion , later adding, \u201cThis is who I am\u2014Boom! A white woman of privilege born of the Covenant\u2014I am not on the outside but inside.\u201d Williams\u2019s impatience with subtlety, penchant for aphorisms (\u201cWilderness is a necessity, not a luxury\u201d; \u201cThe silence before us is time\u201d), and wide embrace of repetition threaten to dull the book\u2019s message early on. But the more she repeats her arguments\u2014sometimes within the same paragraph\u2014for saving public lands, standing up to the oil and gas industries, and building \u201canother world in the ashes of this one,\u201d the more effective Erosion becomes. Williams\u2019s and Jamie\u2019s books arrive late in a year that has already seen climate literature advance in intimate (Margaret Renkl\u2019s Late Migrations ), imaginative ( Karen Russell\u2019s Orange World ), and authoritative (Lopez\u2019s aforementioned Horizon ) ways. On their own, Surfacing and Erosion aren\u2019t quite at the level of those works. But taken together, their disparate approaches to the same idea \u2014\u201cTo belong to a place and a group of people saves our lives,\u201d as Williams puts it\u2014prove to be, almost despite themselves, encouraging.","headline":"Nature Writing That Sees Possibility in Climate Change","article_name":598528.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2019\/09\/surfacing-erosion-alternative-views-climate-change\/598528\/","date_published":"2019-09-22 11:00:00","article_length":7886,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:26.417575","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/entertainment\/archive\/2019\/09\/surfacing-erosion-alternative-views-climate-change\/598528\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It reshaped how the world thought about climate change. But its prized trait\u2014bloodless economic efficiency\u2014won it few friends on the right or left. The American carbon tax, an alluringly simple policy once hailed by environmentalists, scholars, and politicians as a cure-all for climate change that, for all its elegance in economic models, could not overcome its enduring unpopularity with the American public, died last month at its home in Washington, D.C. It was 47. The death was confirmed by President Joe Biden\u2019s utter lack of interest in passing it. The carbon tax aimed to reduce carbon-dioxide pollution\u2014which heats the air, acidifies the ocean, and causes climate change\u2014by applying a commonsense idea: If you don\u2019t want people to do something, charge them money for it. The tax would have levied a fee\u2014ranging from $5 to, in some estimates, more than $150\u2014on every ton of carbon released into the atmosphere. Such a cost would have percolated through the economy, raising gasoline and jet-fuel prices, closing coal-fired power plants, and encouraging consumers and companies to adopt cleaner forms of energy. It was a straightforward, perhaps even beautiful, idea\u2014a bid to apply the economic precepts of the 19th century to one of the great problems of the 21st. Its poise was matched by its elite support. The carbon tax won acclaim from self-described socialists and red-blooded libertarians, Democratic senators and Republican secretaries of state, Elon Musk and Janet Yellen. It was a particular favorite of the economics profession. Some 3,589 economists once declared it \u201cthe most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions\u201d; in 2018, it helped William Nordhaus, a Yale professor and the author of several books about the policy, win the Nobel Prize in Economics. Yet for all its credibility on campus, the carbon tax could not triumph in the real world\u2014that is, on Capitol Hill. In 1993, and again in 2009 and 2010, Congress considered bills that would have put a price on carbon pollution nationwide. Both efforts failed in the Senate. And while a handful of liberal states, including California, New York, and New Jersey, have succeeded in pricing some of their carbon pollution , none has passed an out-and-out carbon tax. Even evergreen Washington State could not implement an economy-wide carbon tax by ballot referendum\u2014and it tried  twice . The policy\u2019s health had been declining for years, supporters said, and it never completely recovered from a gunshot wound sustained a decade ago. In a campaign ad in October 2010, Joe Manchin\u2014running a grueling race for one of West Virginia\u2019s Senate seats\u2014 fired a rifle at a draft version of the Obama administration\u2019s carbon-price bill. Although that bill already stood little chance of passage, the attack entered the realm of Washington fable and left the policy permanently weakened. By this spring, when Democrats began debating their first major climate bill in 11 years, the carbon tax could find no purchase in congressional negotiations. Only a handful of senators \u2014chiefly Sheldon Whitehouse , a Democrat from Rhode Island\u2014regularly talked it up. Most ignored it. But the carbon tax\u2019s condition significantly worsened last month, when an ExxonMobil lobbyist revealed that his employer, which had claimed to support a carbon tax since 2009, only did so knowing that it could never pass. \u201cCarbon tax is not going to happen \u2026 It is a nonstarter. Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans,\u201d the lobbyist, Keith McCoy, said in a secret recording made by the left-wing activist group Greenpeace. \u201cBut it gives us a talking point. We can say, \u2018Well, what is ExxonMobil for? Well, we\u2019re for a carbon tax.\u2019\u201d Darren Woods, Exxon\u2019s chief executive, denied the assessment and claimed that the company\u2019s support was genuine. But the words had been said. The carbon tax died several hours later. The carbon tax ended life as an emblem of climate policy. But it was born and raised to resolve a very different crisis. In 1973, David G. Wilson, a 45-year-old engineer at MIT, found himself \u201cabsolutely consumed\u201d by a problem facing the new and experimental recycling industry. In short: Nobody was recycling, nobody knew how to pay for it, and manufacturers weren\u2019t even using recycled materials, because raw materials could be had for cheaper. Wilson\u2019s solution was a \u201cvirgin-materials tax.\u201d If you \u201cput a fee on the use of virgin materials,\u201d you fixed the price gap and gave companies an incentive to recycle, he later explained to The  Boston Globe . That winter, oil-producing countries slammed an embargo on the United States. The price of gasoline quadrupled, and Americans began trying to conserve energy in earnest for the first time since World War II. The virgin-materials tax would work for this problem too, Wilson realized. The government could treat carbon-based fuels as a virgin material, tax their use on a per-ton basis, and redistribute the revenue back to Americans. The carbon tax\u2014what we would now call a \u201crevenue-neutral carbon tax\u201d\u2014was born. But it did not catch on until a group of atmospheric chemists, some of them working down the street at Harvard, publicized the existence of the greenhouse effect several years later. In December 1981, at a conference for American economists at the Washington Hilton, William Nordhaus, the Yale professor, asked what economics could do about the problem of carbon dioxide. Carbon pollution, he argued, was a negative externality, a cost borne by someone who didn\u2019t consent to paying it, like conventional air pollution. But carbon dioxide was a much trickier problem than smog, Nordhaus said, because its costs diffused through space and time. If your factory makes smog, your neighbors suffer from it immediately. But if your factory emits CO\u2082, then the people who suffer from it most might live in another country\u2014and another century . Nordhaus entertained two solutions. The first was a standard, which would force everything that emits carbon\u2014such as cars, power plants, and steel mills\u2014to install emissions-reducing technology. The second was a tax, which would levy the same fee on each ton of CO\u2082 pollution from all sources. In one of the most important paragraphs ever published about climate-change policy, Nordhaus endorsed the tax. He reasoned that the costs of carbon-abating standards varied wildly from sector to sector: For instance, it might cost $100 to reduce a ton of carbon from a car, but only $25 to reduce a ton from a power plant. But a carbon tax subjected every sector to the same cost per ton of carbon, meaning you could remove the most carbon for the fewest dollars. Ultimately, humanity should care only about reducing as many tons  of carbon as possible, as cheaply as possible, he said. Nordhaus\u2019s paper, which became the field\u2019s foundational work, arrived in the middle of a revolution in policy making: Officials in the outgoing Carter administration and incoming Reagan administration had started emphasizing the intellectual framework of economics\u2014and its respect for rationality, efficiency, and cost-benefit analyses\u2014over other ways of addressing society\u2019s problems. The carbon tax gave climate change a place in that framework. By 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency was modeling what a carbon tax would mean for American emissions. Soon the Congressional Budget Office was researching one too. By the time James Hansen, the director of climate science at NASA, told the Senate in 1988 that global warming had begun , lawmakers knew a carbon tax was one of their best bets. The carbon tax came into legal majority in 1990, when Finland passed the world\u2019s first version of the policy. A year later, the European Commission said it would implement a carbon tax by 1993. Back at home, its family was growing. Republicans had become keen on the carbon tax\u2019s cousin: emissions-trading systems , or \u201ccap and trade\u201d schemes. These offered a new way to price carbon pollution. Under cap-and-trade, the government decreed the total amount of pollution allowed each year, then auctioned off the right to emit it. By the 1992 presidential election, Democrats were more likely to favor a carbon tax, while Republicans endorsed a carbon market\u2014when they endorsed climate policy at all. But an even more important fissure was opening in Washington. The industries that stood to lose from climate policy\u2014heavy polluters such as the coal, railroad, oil, and steel industries\u2014were organizing against policy faster than allies were coalescing around it. They were beginning to deny the science of climate change, and they were dragging the GOP along with them. Four years earlier, in 1988, President George H. W. Bush had promised to fight climate change. \u201cThose who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the 'White House effect,\u2019\u201d he said. Now Bush warned in the final days of his failing reelection campaign that Bill Clinton would impose a \u201cdrastic\u201d and \u201cpunishing\u201d carbon tax. After he took office, Clinton proposed a \u201cBTU tax\u201d that would have raised the cost of coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy. Although it was not a carbon tax, Vice President Al Gore, who had called for a carbon tax in his 1992 best seller, Earth in the Balance , meant for it to resemble one. But the tax bombed. Heavy industry rallied against it, and its simplicity became a liability: Utilities insisted that the tax appear as a line-item charge on every customer\u2019s power bill. By 1994, the BTU tax was dead. The Senate never even voted on it. (These sorry events are recounted in more detail in the political scientist Matto Mildenberger\u2019s book, Carbon Captured . ) Business opposition took down Europe\u2019s continent-wide carbon-tax proposal too. For the next decade and a half, only the Scandinavian countries \u2014Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland\u2014managed to pass and keep a carbon tax aimed at curbing emissions. From then on, cap-and-trade\u2014not a carbon tax\u2014would prove the more politically successful form of carbon pricing. In the mid-2000s, Gore\u2019s documentary An Inconvenient Truth, as well as a dire United Nations report and a rash of severe hurricanes, again pushed the world to adopt climate policy. The European Union finally enacted a cap-and-trade scheme, although it remained weak for another decade. But in Congress, cap-and-trade fared no better than the carbon tax had. A bipartisan climate coalition fell apart in 2010 before it could agree to a cap-and-trade bill. President Barack Obama backed off supporting a Democratic climate bill. More recently, a bipartisan effort to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax\u2014led, ironically, by some of the same Reaganites who had once championed cap-and-trade or no climate policy at all\u2014faltered during the Trump administration. At last count, only one national Republican lawmaker, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, supported a carbon tax. Cap-and-trade has caught on as a regional policy. In 2008, seven northeastern states launched a cap-and-trade market for their electricity emissions, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. It now includes 11 states, and Pennsylvania and North Carolina could join soon. California adopted an expansive cap-and-trade program in 2013. Earlier this year, Washington State voted to join that market . But at the federal level, policy makers have rejected policies that maximize efficiency at all. Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill adopts the standard-based approach that Nordhaus once disdained. Looking back, some political scientists say that the reasons for the failure of efficient carbon policy, at least in the United States, are clear. With the exception of Canada, every country that has adopted carbon pricing has no major fossil-fuel industry, notes Nina Kelsey, a political scientist at George Washington University. (Coal-rich Australia once adopted a carbon price, then repealed it.) Carbon prices save dollars, these researchers admit. But they expend an even scarcer resource: political capital. Because a carbon price affects all of society, it increases costs for every energy consumer, without providing an immediate alternative. Because most industries interact with the energy system only as consumers, that takes a cohort that wouldn\u2019t care about climate policy in the abstract and turns it into a foe. Meanwhile, a price does nothing to convince \u201cconvertible\u201d industries \u2014businesses such as utilities and automakers, who could support an energy transition if they changed some aspect of their production line\u2014to switch sides. And it benefits \u201cwinner\u201d industries, such as solar-panel makers, only indirectly. In other words, a carbon price might cheaply eliminate carbon, but it does not change political coalitions to make passing more climate policy in the future  any easier. Today, cap-and-trade markets are by far the dominant form of carbon pricing worldwide. Now that China has launched its cap-and-trade system, carbon prices cover 20 percent of global emissions. Forty-five countries are covered by some form of carbon price, according to the World Bank . But relatively few of them use carbon taxes. Advocates say they will cryogenically freeze the American carbon tax in case it is needed in the future. Some supporters argue that the tax is one of very few climate policies that can survive a conservative Supreme Court, because the Constitution clearly empowers Congress to levy taxes but may not allow other types of regulation. Yet near-term prospects for the policy\u2019s revival are dim. The American carbon tax leaves behind dozens of supportive think-tank employees, thousands of politically engaged and idealistic Americans, and 3,589 dejected economists.","headline":"Carbon Tax, Beloved Policy to Fix Climate Change, Is Dead at 47","article_name":619507.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/07\/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47\/619507\/","date_published":"2021-07-20 19:50:18","article_length":13688,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:27.288164","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/07\/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47\/619507\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"What a new report on theology and global warming means for public policy Snowmageddon, snowpocalypse, snowzilla, just snow . Superstorm Sandy, receding shorelines, and more . Hurricanes Isaac, Ivan, and Irene, with cousins Rammasun, Bopha, and Haiyan. The parade of geological changes and extreme weather events around the world since 2011 has been stunning. Perhaps that's part of why, as the Public Religion Research Institute reported on Friday, \"The number of Americans who believe that natural disasters are evidence of the apocalypse has increased somewhat over the past couple years.\" As of 2014, it's estimated that nearly half of Americans\u201449 percent\u2014say natural disasters are a sign of \"the end times,\" as described in the Bible. That's up from an estimated 44 percent in 2011. This belief is more prevalent in some religious communities than others. White evangelical Protestants, for example, are more likely than any other group to believe that natural disasters are a sign of the end times, and they're least likely to assign some of the blame to climate change (participants were allowed to select both options if they wanted). Black Protestants were close behind white evangelicals in terms of apprehending the apocalypse, but they were also the group most likely to believe in climate change, too. Predictably, the religiously unaffiliated were the least likely to believe superstorms are apocalyptic\u2014but even so, a third of that group said they see signs of the end times in the weather. Americans' Explanations for Recent Natural Disasters, by Religious Affiliation This is an interesting study in how religious beliefs affect thinking on science and current events, but it also may have implications for how people view public policy and their responsibility for the natural world. If God will intercede to stop humans from destroying the earth\u2014which 39 percent of respondents believed to be true\u2014why legislate limits on carbon emissions? Or, for that matter, why drive less, or eat fewer steaks , or change any behavior that affects the environment? Plus, a large portion of Americans don't think humans are responsible for changes in the earth's temperature or weather, whether or not they think God's involved. A majority of respondents said they either don't believe the earth's temperature is rising, or they believe it but think it's happening for a reason other than human activity. Less than a third of respondents said they are \"very concerned\" about climate change, and half said they're \"somewhat unconcerned\" or \"unconcerned.\" A 2014 survey by Pew Research Center yielded slightly different results: In it, 61 percent of Americans agreed that the earth's temperature is rising, and of that group, 40 percent attributed the warming to human activity. But in general, this just isn't an topic Americans seem to prioritize. In the new PRRI survey, participants rated climate change as less important than many other issues, including unemployment, income inequality, healthcare, the deficit, immigration, and education reform. To be fair, people's views on the existence and importance of climate change aren't the same as their views on environmentalism, and this is reflected across the religious communities that were included in the survey. Significant majorities of Jews, mainline Protestants, white and Hispanic Catholics, and the religiously unaffiliated agreed that God expects people to care for animals, plants, and the planet. But 43 percent of black Protestants and 46 percent of white evangelicals said the opposite: The earth, they say, was made for the use of humankind. Stewardship of the earth is a complex topic, theologically. The Bible has many beautiful passages on the wonders of creation, from the Psalms to the Book of Job. But even at the very beginning of Genesis, other passages stand in tension with the idea that humans should shape their civilizations with a concern for the environment. \u201cBe fruitful and multiply,\" it reads. \"Fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\u201d This could be interpreted to mean that humans should be able to use the earth's resources limitlessly\u2014or that \"dominion\" comes with the responsibility of stewardship. Either reading might theoretically shape the way someone things about climate change. If someone sees humans as the natural rulers of the earth, it makes sense that he or she wouldn't prioritize renewable energy production or environmentally friendly oil drilling. But maybe some evangelicals and others who see signs of the end times just believe that today's events have already been written : The nations were angry; and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great\u2014and for destroying those who destroy the earth.","headline":"Half of Americans Think Climate Change Is a Sign of the Apocalypse","article_name":383029.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/11\/half-of-americans-think-climate-change-is-a-sign-of-the-apocalypse\/383029\/","date_published":"2014-11-22 12:00:00","article_length":4962,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:27.587145","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2014\/11\/half-of-americans-think-climate-change-is-a-sign-of-the-apocalypse\/383029\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"It tries to find hope against a backdrop of failure. People must be burned out on major climate reports, and can you really blame them? Every year, it seems, yet another group of scientists compiles what we know about climate change. And every year, with few exceptions, the broad outlines of that knowledge seem worrying. But nothing ever really changes\u2014and so our ongoing apocalypse becomes not only all the more terrifying, but also all the more tedious. That burnout is understandable, but I urge you to pay attention to\u2014yes\u2014 a new report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN-convened coalition of climate scientists from around the world. Whereas previous assessments have warned of our hideous overheated future, this one does something different: It tries to sketch a better one. The report articulates what seems, from the vantage point of 2018, like a best-case scenario for climate change. It describes what the world will look like if it warms by only 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.5 degrees Celsius, by the end of this century. Meeting that target would require humanity to abandon coal and other fossil fuels in the next decade or two\u2014an economic transition so abrupt that, in the IPCC\u2019s words, it \u201chas no documented historic precedents. \u201d This lukewarm world would still suffer many of the consequences of climate change. There would be more deadly heat waves, more heavy rainstorms, and more intense and frequent droughts. Yet some of the phenomenon\u2019s most catastrophic symptoms, including dozens of feet of sea-level rise and planet-wracking extinctions, might be averted. The report, in other words, lays out humanity\u2019s last best hope for managing climate change. But it does so against a backdrop of generational failure. More than a quarter century ago, the countries of the world hammered out the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In language signed by President George H. W. Bush and ratified by the Senate, that document \u2014which later gave rise to both the IPCC\u2019s reports and the Paris Agreement\u2014laid out the goal for all of the UN\u2019s future work on climate change. \u201cThe ultimate objective,\u201d it said, was to cut greenhouse-gas emissions so as to \u201cprevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d \u201cClimate scientists have made it abundantly clear, over the past few years, that we\u2019ve already passed that goal. We\u2019ve already dangerously interfered,\u201d says Christopher Field , the director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, who has worked on previous UN reports but was not involved in this one. The new report confirms his contention. It finds that the world has already warmed by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius, since humans began sending industrial pollution into the atmosphere. The costs of this warmth can be seen around the world: This decade alone, sweltering heat waves have killed thousands; engorged floods have ravaged cities from Houston to North Carolina; and half of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef has died . The question is what happens next. \u201cThe international community is struggling with how to address the climate challenge \u2026 [while] not being able to meet the ultimate objective,\u201d Field told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen dangerous interference. Now the question is, How do we deal as effectively as we can with that?\u201d The new 2.7-degree plan tries to lay out such a strategy. Written by 91 researchers from around the world, it summarizes the findings of more than 6,000 different scientific studies. It argues that humanity must begin rapidly switching away from fossil fuels if it hopes to avoid ecological upheaval. But almost every step of its prescription sits at odds with current policy. Under the plan, the level of carbon pollution released into the atmosphere every year must begin to fall immediately. (Instead, it hit a record high last year .) By 2030, the world would need to have cut its annual emissions by about half. (Even the Obama administration\u2019s now-canceled climate policies would have cut U.S. emissions only by about a quarter by that year.) By 2050, the world must get 80 percent of its electricity from renewable or nuclear power. (Today, only about 20 percent of electricity comes from those sources.) Avoiding two degrees of warming \u201cis now totally unrealistic.\u201d Additionally, humanity would need to start removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emitted by 2050. But even in that world, humanity would probably overshoot the 1.5-degree target for a few decades. Nowhere are the report\u2019s prescriptions more glaring than around coal. By 2050, it warns that coal must generate no more than 7 percent of global electricity. Today coal generates about 40 percent of the world\u2019s power. But more than 1,600 new coal plants are due to come online worldwide in the next few decades, most under contract from Chinese companies. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has tried to create new subsidies for coal companies . It has also moved to weaken or repeal pollution regulations limiting airborne neurotoxins, as well those reducing greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014rules that attracted the ire of coal companies. \u201cMany will dismiss the [2.7-degree] target as unrealistic, if not laughable,\u201d said Kim Cobb , a professor of climate science at Georgia Tech, in an email. \u201cIt is not our job as scientists to give the world a \u2018pass\u2019 in the face of damaging delays in tackling climate change.\u201d She added that the report\u2019s authors \u201cspent months of their lives outlining a path that is entirely justified, from a cost perspective, and urgently needed.\u201d The report marks the first time the IPCC has examined a 2.7-degree warming \u201ctarget.\u201d For more than a decade, every nation on the planet has pledged to limit warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius. This goal remains as notional as its newer and more ambitious peer: Even if every country met its obligations as they stand today under the Paris Agreement, the world would emit too much carbon dioxide and shoot past the goal. But that less ambitious target of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit has started to look more and more dangerous. In particular, increasing Earth\u2019s temperature by that amount seems like it might greatly increase the risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a threshold somewhere\u2014probably in the vicinity of [3.6 degrees Fahrenheit]\u2014where we\u2019re very likely committed to more than [30 feet of sea-level rise] over centuries,\u201d Field told me. It may be possible to preserve those large stores of ice at 2.7 degrees, scientists have found. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that the report as a whole should be seen as a reappraisal of where we\u2019re heading as a planet. \u201cIt\u2019s like we had a medical issue. The physician had diagnosed it. But now they\u2019re worried it might be worse than we thought,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we go back and do a complete work over, every type of test we can imagine.\u201d The new prognosis is stirring. A world that warms by 3.6 degrees\u2014and not 2.7 degrees\u2014will find that its problems metastasize out of scale with that seemingly small difference. In the hotter world, the number of people affected by water scarcity will double. Twice as many corn crops will perish in the tropics. The size of global fisheries will drop by 50 percent. And 99 percent of the world\u2019s coral reefs will perish. No ecosystem on Earth is safe from climate change. Plants and animals will also have a much harder time. If the world warms 3.6 degrees, the number of species projected to lose half their habitat will double as compared with the 2.7-degree world. These effects are particularly acute for the Arctic. In the 2.7-degree world, the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean will entirely melt about once a century. In the 3.6-degree world, the Arctic Ocean will go ice-free about once a decade\u2014a potentially cataclysmic moment for polar bears, seals, and other high-latitude mammals. \u201cA lot of the reason it\u2019s been so challenging to turn the corner on climate change is it will mean that some of the folks who are in positions of power and privilege won\u2019t maintain that privilege,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe have a huge number of special interests that benefit from making the transition slower rather than faster.\u201d Even lacking that clause, the new report might set the stage for the next stage of the climate challenge. As every climate scientist will tell you, the battle to prevent climate change entirely has already been lost. But the battle to blunt its effects\u2014to manage it , as humanity manages the threats of hunger, poverty, war, disease, and other afflictions, and to choose a better, cooler future\u2014has just begun.","headline":"How to Understand the UN\u2019s Dire New Climate Report","article_name":572356.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/how-to-understand-the-uns-dire-new-climate-report\/572356\/","date_published":"2018-10-09 21:57:17","article_length":8707,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:28.478667","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/10\/how-to-understand-the-uns-dire-new-climate-report\/572356\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The Federal Reserve should act aggressively to reduce that risk, a leading economic historian argues. A few years ago, Mark Carney, a former Goldman Sachs director who now leads the Bank of England, sounded a warning. Global warming, he said, could send the world economy spiraling into another 2008-like crisis. He called for central banks to act aggressively and immediately to reduce the risk of climate-related catastrophe, taking the warming planet as seriously as they would a cooling economy. Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, knows quite a bit about central banks\u2014and the Great Recession. Last year he published Crashed , an award-winning account of the 2008 collapse and its aftermath. In that book, he argues that the U.S. Federal Reserve was the pivotal American institution in stopping a second Great Depression. Its actions were \u201chistorically unprecedented, spectacular in scale,\u201d he writes, and widely understood by experts to be the \u201cdecisive innovation of the crisis.\u201d Now, in an article this month in Foreign Policy , Tooze asserts that the Fed needs to battle climate change in the same way. \u201cIf the world is to cope with climate change, policymakers will need to pull every lever at their disposal,\u201d he writes. \u201cFaced with this threat, to indulge in the idea that central banks, as key agencies of the state, can limit themselves to worrying about financial stability \u2026 is its own form of denial.\u201d Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, would not call himself a climate-change denier. Indeed, he is probably the most powerful person in the American government who affirms climate science. Yet he has taken a subdued approach to mitigating climate change. In April, in a letter to Senator Brian Schatz , Powell wrote that \u201caddressing climate change is a responsibility that Congress has entrusted to other agencies.\u201d The Federal Reserve, he added, is using its tools to \u201cprepare financial institutions for severe weather.\u201d In England, by contrast, Carney has convened 33 central banks to investigate how to \u201cgreen the financial system. \u201d According to Axios , every powerful central bank is working with him\u2014except for Banco do Brasil and the Fed. I talked with Tooze last week about whether climate change could really cause another global crash, how to think about climate policy in history, and what the Fed could do to decarbonize the economy. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Robinson Meyer:  In your Foreign Policy piece , you draw an analogy between the financial crisis of 2008 and what\u2019s happening now with climate change. You describe a crisis in a near-term future, one where climate change has taken hold but where much of the economy is still tied up in oil. I will say: I\u2019m a little skeptical. I\u2019m not sure you could get the kind of sudden financial stop through climate change that you got in 2007 and 2008. What\u2019s the right way to think about that analogy? Adam Tooze: That skepticism is perfectly warranted. I\u2019d say that in some sense, I\u2019m here writing with my historian\u2019s hat on, and all I\u2019m really observing is that Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, in 2015, in a speech which has subsequently received massive coverage \u2014and he is a man, after all, absolutely of the global financial establishment\u2014coined the idea of a climate Minsky moment. [ Editor\u2019s note : A Minsky moment is when an asset\u2019s price suddenly collapses after a long period of growth.] So the point, to me, is not so much the realism of that prospect, of the fact that we could have some kind of subprimelike scenario. For me, the significant thing is that the argument is actually going on inside the establishment, in the network of financial regulators and central-bank thinkers. Are we likely to see a financial Minsky moment? I think that is a reasonable question mark. We would need [fossil-fuel assets] to be on the balance sheet of actors who were under huge pressure in a fire-sale situation and who couldn\u2019t deal with a sudden revaluation. We would need an entire network of causation to be there, which is what produced the unique crisis of 2007 to 2008. Meyer : What would cause that kind of sudden revaluation? Would there need to be a policy shock, such as the United States suddenly imposing a climate policy? Tooze: That would be one way in which this could be sudden. So imagine that we stay on our current path, and we\u2019re headed toward 3 or 4 degrees\u2019 [Celsius] temperature change. And then imagine some of the nonlinearities kick in, which the climate scientists tell us about, and we face a Fukushima-style event. What happens next? You then get nervous democratic politicians\u2014and not necessarily those who are known for their populism, but just nervous democratic politicians\u2014suddenly deciding that we have to stop doing one or another part of our carbon-based economy. It has to stop, and it has to stop immediately. And then you get big shocks. Then you get sudden revaluations. That, I think, is the sort of scenario that the Bank of England people are working with. In other words, the success of the delaying tactics of the carbon lobby create a situation in which we\u2019re then faced with the possibility of a sudden regulatory shock, something that really inflicts major losses. Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what\u2019s happening now Meyer: You quote this astonishing statistic: \u201cOne-third of equity and fixed income assets issued in global financial markets can be classified as belonging to the natural resource and extraction sectors, as well as carbon-intensive power utilities, chemicals, construction, and industrial goods firms.\u201d Who is in that group? Are those the oil majors such as Exxon, or does that encompass every construction firm? Tooze: It isn\u2019t just the oil and gas majors, because they wouldn\u2019t get you to 30 percent. Exxon isn\u2019t big enough to get you to that kind of percentage. It\u2019s Exxon, and [the major automakers] Daimler and BMW, and the entire carbon-exposed complex. In Germany right now, there\u2019s a very serious conversation about whether BMW and Daimler are too big to fail. Americans don\u2019t have that sense of a manufacturing industry anymore\u2014except, of course, we did end up bailing out GM in 2008. But Germany is far, far more exposed. A huge slice of their economy is basically all about internal combustion engines, and so that number includes all of those stocks, for sure. Meyer: And just to get back to the financial-crisis point, if there were some kind of immediate crunch, and all those stocks tanked \u2026 Tooze: Yes. If we saw a huge shock to, say, European equity [exchange-traded funds], which were heavily in German automotive, that\u2019s the sort of trigger that we might be looking at. Meyer: In your view, what do you see as the goal of climate policy? Is it only to reduce carbon emissions? Do you see any benefits to the economic transition that we scientifically have to make, beyond mitigating climate change? Tooze : I mean, that\u2019s been the green-modernization agenda of climate politics, certainly in Europe, since the 1980s, right? This is not simply a zero-sum game; this is a structural transformation that has many very attractive properties. There\u2019s loads of excellent jobs that could be created in this kind of transition. There\u2019s no reason why, even by conventional GDP-type metrics, it need even be associated with the kind of feel-bad factor of slow GDP growth. Then [you could] also link it to a revival of social democracy for the United States. From a progressive political point of view, that\u2019s obviously extremely attractive. Whether that will, in fact, ease the formation of majorities in Congress is another question. Because, after all, it does somehow have to get through the Senate, you know. Meyer: Yes, well, welcome to the life of a climate-change reporter. You get to talk about lots of ideas and policies, but then it\u2019s all about what will survive the Senate. Tooze : Exactly. I mean, ever since the 1990s that\u2019s been the logjam on any serious American commitment. So \u2026 Meyer: I think part of what I\u2019m asking is: When you look at a third of securities tied up in the carbon economy and the evidence for decoupling GDP growth from carbon emissions maybe not being as strong as we\u2019d like , do you think the change that needs to happen is realistic? Tooze : Realistic? No. I mean, depends what you mean by realism. The scale of the challenge requires a boldness of action for which there is no precedent. That\u2019s the only good purpose that the war analogies serve, in my mind. I think in many ways the war-emergency analogy is terribly unhelpful because [climate change] is not that kind of challenge at all really, but at least that gives you some measure of the scale and urgency of what\u2019s necessary. Read: Are we living through climate\u2019s worst-case scenario? Meyer : In your piece, you write: \u201cThose in the United States who call for a Green New Deal or a Green Marshall Plan are, if anything, understating the scale of what is needed.\u201d Do you think climate action needs to be larger than, say, the U.S. mobilization for World War II? Tooze : Well, less large in absolute terms. Because even the U.S. was spending almost 40 percent of GDP on World War II. And if you\u2019re the Soviet Union, you\u2019re spending 55 to 60 percent in 1940. We don\u2019t need to do anything like that. It needs to be much bigger than the New Deal, which in fiscal-policy terms was really quite trivial. Crucially, what makes it totally unlike the war is that there\u2019s no happy end. There\u2019s no moment where you win and then everything goes back to the way it was before, but just better. That\u2019s a misunderstanding. This isn\u2019t crash dieting; this is a permanent change in lifestyle, and we need to love that and we need to live it and we need to own it and we need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that this is for us and for all subsequent generations of humans. And furthermore\u2014and much more fundamentally than any of those things\u2014this isn\u2019t really about America. I mean, America can be an obstacle and get in the way, but none of the really hard choices needs to be made by America, and all the really hard choices need to be made by people like China and India and Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia. Our choices are all trivially easy, because for all the assets that we\u2019re going to lose, we need to create $5 trillion worth of new ones. Meyer: What\u2019s the closest analogy to what needs to happen? Is there a single historical analogy that we could think of\u2014of a broad transition with no happy victory parades at the end? Tooze : I don\u2019t think I\u2019m uncomfortable with saying that this is unprecedented, so I\u2019m not sure that looking for analogies is all that helpful, to be honest. I don\u2019t write lessons-from-history-type pieces, because I really buy the hockey stick. [ Editor\u2019s note : The \u201chockey stick\u201d graph shows that economic growth over the past 300 years has been unprecedented compared with human history before it.] In other words, we have never had to fundamentally rethink the energy basis of our way of life. I mean, we never have. Meyer: Industrialization has only happened once. Tooze : Exactly. And furthermore, it has turned out to be exponential\u2014a hockey-stick-style process. So no, it\u2019s not obvious to me that [analogies are] a terribly helpful way of thinking about it. It strikes me, perhaps, as an indication of the poverty of our democratic imagination right now that we go backwards so much. One of the striking things about the American left is its nostalgia. There\u2019s always some moment that you can handily pick up, a lesson you can learn from the New Deal. Or if not the New Deal, then the Progressive era. Or if not from the Progressive era, then the Homestead Strike. Like there\u2019s some heritage of struggle that you want to draw on. And that backwards move is\u2014even among the smartest, smartest people on the American left\u2014is a compulsion, almost. It seems to me, in some sense, a mirror image of the strange practice of originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The sheer fact of the continuity of the American political argument, back to the founding, sucks people into this line of thinking. You don\u2019t have that very much in Germany. There isn\u2019t anyone in Germany saying, \u201cWhich bit of mid-20th-century history is this most like? ,\u201d mercifully. The one analogy that has popped up in Germany is reunification, which I actually think is quite a good one, because that\u2019s still an ongoing problem. So in the American case, it would be civil rights and Reconstruction, which isn\u2019t a particularly optimistic comparison to draw. It\u2019s an ongoing problem, it\u2019s a deep historic problem, it only happened once, we still haven\u2019t fixed it, and we\u2019re not at peace. Meyer : There\u2019s a kind of shallow view of climate change: that it is something we need to avert or stop. And that\u2019s somewhat true. But there\u2019s also a deeper view: that climate change is the situation within which all other politics will happen for the next several generations, at least. That like Reconstruction or the civil-rights movement, it needs to be something that people take on like a moral commitment, in the same way they take on genocide prevention as a moral commitment. Tooze: I\u2019m not sure quite why you go to moral commitment here. I can see the attraction of that. But I would take a more functionalist line. Like, morals aside, mass incarceration, the destruction of the lives of millions of African American men\u2014it is clearly a moral issue. But that isn\u2019t, to me, the thing which should give it urgency. The crisis that African American men suffer in the United States is extraordinarily acute and oppresses them every single day of their lives, from cradle to grave. Anyway, this is the point where I think this analogy becomes problematic. I do like your point that this is a forever problem\u2014at least for all conceivable futures\u2014like working through that problem of racism and the legacies of slavery is a forever problem in the United States. Meyer: And there\u2019s a degree to which it also increases the functional load on everything else. Tooze: Yes. Because problems that we thought we\u2019d fixed, like the Green Revolution and the feeding of the world population, for instance\u2014totally not obvious that those fixes cope with the next 20 years of what\u2019s ahead of us. The food problem that was such an oppressive issue globally in the 1970s may resurge in an absolutely dramatic way. Read: A centuries-old idea could revolutionize climate policy Meyer: Given all that, if Jerome Powell decided that he wanted to intervene on the side of climate action, what could he do? What could the Fed do? Tooze: What I think the Fed should announce is that it enthusiastically supports the idea of a bipartisan infrastructure push focused on the American electrical network, first and foremost, so that we can actually hook up the renewable-generating capacity\u2014which is now eminently, you know, realistic in economic terms. Setting a backstop to a a fiscal-side-led investment push is the obvious thing. Meyer: So basically it should say: If the government were to issue a bunch of new debt to fund green investment and no one was buying it, then the Fed would? Tooze: And there isn\u2019t the slightest evidence [it wouldn\u2019t sell], because the U.S. Treasury is issuing unprecedented quantities of debt right here and right now. But the Fed would view [the issue of new debt tied to infrastructure] as in no way alarming. It is indeed a highly appropriate response to an environment of extremely low interest rates, and [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers & Co. would argue that it might help, as it were, to suck us out of the state of secular stagnation that we\u2019re in. Then you could get into the technicalities of thinking how the Fed addresses issues of finance and green bonds. That would be another avenue to go down\u2014for the Fed to take a role in helping develop a classification of green bonds, of green financing, with a view also to rolling out comprehensive demands for disclosure on the part of American firms, for climate risks to be fully declared on balance sheets, and for due recognition to be given to firms that are in the business of proactively preparing themselves for decarbonization. Meyer: One idea that you mention in particular is that if there were some kind of green bond, it would count in some greater way against the amount of capital that banks are required to hold. Tooze: Yes, exactly. Where it would really matter is that the Fed could work to modify Dodd-Frank regulation in such a way as to be supportive of that kind of lending, and the Fed could proactively work through the Basel process [which governs international bank rules] to make changes at the global level. You could, for instance, declare that the Fed views with disfavor the role of several large American banks in continuing to fund coal investment. Some of the carbon-tracking NGOs have done very good work showing and exposing the way in which some of the largest, the most reputable American banks are still in the business of lending to Big Coal. Banking regulation could be tweaked in a way that would produce a tilt against that. Meyer: Has the Fed ever done something like this before? Where it\u2019s said, \u201cWe need to move the economy in this direction, so we\u2019re going to treat certain asset classes favorably?\u201d Tooze: Yeah, this idea of neutrality comes up: Isn\u2019t the Fed supposed to be neutral? It\u2019s an attractive idea, and goes along with the idea of Fed independence\u2014except it\u2019s completely ahistorical. I mean, the classic role of the Fed is to support government-issued debt. Insofar as the Green New Deal is a government-issued business, the Fed has just an absolutely historical warrant for supporting fiscal action. It hasn\u2019t historically done that\u2014and there\u2019ve been moments where the Fed acted as a goad, notably in the early stages of the Clinton administration. But with regards to the broader economy, the entire federal-government apparatus essentially stood behind the spread of home ownership in the United States and the promotion of suburbanization through the credit system. And kind of what we need is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the energy transition. Meyer : But without the crisis at the end of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I guess. Tooze : Of course. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became vehicles for truly toxic modes of leverage and intermediation. But if the question is, Is there historical warrant for the financial agencies of government in the United States biasing the property structure in the economy in a certain way?, the answer is emphatically yes\u2014all the way down to the grotesque role of the New Deal financial apparatus in enshrining the racial segregation of the American urban space, with massive effects from the 1930s onward. The idea of neutrality should not even be allowed in the room in this argument. It\u2019s a question of where we want to be biased. If you look at QE, especially in the U.K. and the EU, it was effectively fossil-biased. [ Editor\u2019s note : Quantitative easing , or QE, is when central banks buy stocks and bonds to boost the economy.] The assets that were bought as part of the asset-purchasing program had heavy carbon contact. That\u2019s not surprising: The bonds of the European energy majors have very high ratings, and so they tend to be part of the process of asset purchases. So in the same way as QE is believed to have an effect on inequality through the way in which it drives asset-market prices, it also underwrites the existing biases of the financial system toward fossil fuels. So monetary policy is not neutral with regards to the environment. There\u2019s no safe space here. The only question is whether you\u2019re going to lead in the right way. Meyer: Last question. With any of this, is there a role for interested Americans to play if they are not particularly tied to the financial- or monetary-policy elite? Tooze : Support your congressperson in doing exactly what AOC did in the hearings with Powell a couple of weeks ago. [ Editor\u2019s Note :  Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Powell whether inflation and unemployment are still closely connected , as the Fed has long argued.] Applaud, follow with interest, raise questions. That\u2019s exactly what needs to be happening. The politicization of monetary policy is a fact. I mean, I write these pieces because I personally think this is eminently suitable for political conversation. If we don\u2019t raise these questions, the de facto politics is, more often than not, conservative and status quo\u2013oriented. So this, like any other area, is one where citizens\u2014whether they\u2019re educated and informed or not\u2014need to wise up, get involved, and follow the arguments and develop positions. So applaud your congresspeople when they do exactly what AOC was doing in that situation. In many ways, I thought it was one of the most hopeful scenes I\u2019ve seen in that kind of hearing in a long time.","headline":"How Climate Change Could Trigger the Next Global Financial Crisis","article_name":595084.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/how-fed-could-fight-climate-change-adam-tooze\/595084\/","date_published":"2019-08-01 14:00:00","article_length":20952,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:29.246386","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/how-fed-could-fight-climate-change-adam-tooze\/595084\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Saying nothing often is saying something. Supreme Court justices typically write opinions that say more than what is strictly necessary to decide the case before them. In those opinions, the justices also communicate with their colleagues, other courts, and the country about the issues, values, and people they deem especially important. When it comes to the possibility and history of racism, however, most of the current justices\u2014with the important exception of Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2014tend to respond the way so many white people do: More often than not, they would rather just not talk about it. That tendency was evident this past term in most of the cases potentially implicating the subject of race. In  Kansas v. Glover , the Court held that a police officer could lawfully stop a vehicle about which the officer knew only that its owner had a revoked driver\u2019s license. In 2016, an officer in Lawrence, Kansas, ran a license-plate check on a moving pickup truck and found that the license of the registered owner\u2014Charles Glover\u2014had been revoked. The officer stopped the truck, which Glover was driving, and Kansas charged him with driving as a habitual violator. In his defense, Glover argued that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects people against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d and the Kansas Supreme Court ruled in his favor , arguing that the officer had not adequately justified the stop and instead had \u201conly a hunch\u201d that Glover was driving. One wouldn\u2019t know it from the several opinions written by the justices, but the defendant appears Black. Does racial profiling explain the officer\u2019s decision to run the vehicle\u2019s license plate? One cannot know. Seth W. Stoughton, Jeffrey J. Noble, and Geoffrey P. Albert: How to actually fix America\u2019s police The Fourth Amendment protects people\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy when they are subject to searches and seizures by the police, but it is difficult to argue that people have such an expectation for their license plates, which are readily viewable by others when an individual is driving. So the Court understandably declined to read the Fourth Amendment as requiring police officers to explain their decision to run a license plate. But the risk of racial profiling is significant, and the justices might have drawn attention to the problem. That the officer spends most of his time running license plates seems unlikely, and at no point in this case did he give an explanation for his action. The justices might have also mentioned that police departments could insist that officers explain their reasons for running a vehicle\u2019s license plate, to help limit racial profiling. Only Sotomayor expressed concern about the police stopping vehicles \u201cbased on nothing more than a demographic profile.\u201d There was no claim of racial discrimination in this specific case, so the amicus briefs filed in Glover\u2019s favor did not focus primarily on the issue of racial profiling. But some of them did mention racial and socioeconomic disparities in police stops across the country; one of them emphasized that Black drivers are more likely than white drivers to be pulled over by the police and pointed to \u201cevidence that racial bias motivates many traffic stops.\u201d The lack of more extensive discussion in the briefs may in part be a function of the Court\u2019s long-standing resistance to discussing the subject in Fourth Amendment cases. Glover is not a one-off. It is extraordinarily rare for the justices\u2014again, except for Sotomayor\u2014to reference race or racism in cases involving police stops. For example, in Utah v. Strieff , in 2016, the Court held that when a police officer discovers a preexisting warrant for a person\u2019s arrest, incriminating evidence seized pursuant to that arrest is admissible in court even if the officer\u2019s stop of the individual was unconstitutional to begin with. The Court had nothing to say about whether it was enabling police to engage in racial profiling. Sotomayor wrote for herself alone that \u201cit is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny.\u201d Read: Pleading for the fourth There are many other examples one could cite and very few counterexamples. Racism was mentioned briefly in a majority opinion in 1968, in Terry v. Ohio , which provided the constitutional basis for the stop that occurred in Glover . There was also a brief discussion of race-based selective enforcement of the law in 1996, in Whren v. United States , but there the Court actually said that issues such as racial profiling and pretextual reasons for traffic stops may not be evaluated under the Fourth Amendment. Occasionally a justice will mention concerns about racism in a dissent, but that\u2019s pretty much it. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case ( Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California ) is another example from this term in which the majority might have at least acknowledged the freighted racial or ethnic context and potential implications of a case, regardless of whether doing so would have altered the outcome. Instead, the majority opinion, which held that the Trump administration had acted arbitrarily (and thus unlawfully) in rescinding the DACA program, limited itself to deciding whether the administration had violated procedural requirements set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act. Four of the five justices in the majority (and all four dissenters) rejected the argument of the respondents that the decision to end DACA was unconstitutional because it had been motivated by animus against the beneficiaries of the program, concluding that there was \u201cno plausible equal protection claim.\u201d Only Sotomayor talked about the possibility of racism given Donald Trump\u2019s past public statements that Mexican immigrants are \u201cpeople that have lots of problems,\u201d \u201cthe bad ones,\u201d and \u201ccriminals, drug dealers, [and] rapists,\u201d and his statement likening undocumented immigrants to \u201canimals\u201d who are responsible for \u201cthe drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, [and] MS13.\u201d Garrett Epps: The Trump administration\u2019s incompetence was the saving grace of 700,000 Dreamers It should not be considered out of bounds for the justices to worry publicly about the possibility of racism just because the racist statements are made by the president of the United States. Such statements invariably affect federal officers further down the chain of command, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence of such influence in a given case to change the result. There were times this past term when most of the justices did better. In Ramos v. Louisiana , the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial requires a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious crime in both federal and state courts. As briefs on behalf of the defendant emphasized, the history of non-unanimous jury verdicts has everything to do with race and racism. Louisiana and Oregon originally permitted non-unanimous jury verdicts to negate the impact of Black and other minority jurors and thereby increase the likelihood of convicting Black people and other minorities. The history in Louisiana is especially ugly. Reconstruction ended in 1876 as part of a compromise among white people that gave Republicans the White House and Democrats the end of military rule in the South. As Republicans tired of pursuing racial equality and joined the Democrats in courting business interests, former Confederate states were emboldened, and established an authoritarian, apartheid social order. Louisiana first embraced non-unanimous verdicts at its constitutional convention in 1898, when it declared white supremacy to be the official policy of the state and adopted numerous measures to disenfranchise Black people on a massive scale. Mississippi did much the same at its constitutional convention in 1890, and put the Confederate battle flag on its state flag in 1894. Stephanie McCurry: The Confederacy was an antidemocratic, centralized State To its credit, the majority in Ramos did emphasize the racist history of laws permitting non-unanimous jury verdicts. But it did so over the fierce objections of the three dissenters. Writing for them, Justice Samuel Alito accused the majority of using \u201c ad hominem rhetoric\u201d that \u201ccontribut[es] to the worst current trends\u201d in public discourse. Alito also declined to concede the existence of this racist history, instead deeming the issue irrelevant to the outcome of the case. \u201cIf Louisiana and Oregon originally adopted their laws allowing non-unanimous verdicts for these reasons, that is deplorable,\u201d he wrote, as if the point were fairly debatable, \u201cbut what does that have to do with the broad constitutional question before us? The answer is: nothing.\u201d (Yet in another case this term, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , Alito wrote a concurring opinion in which he elected to emphasize the anti-Catholic history of certain laws prohibiting government aid to religious schools. It was not necessary for him to have done so to decide the case; he had already joined the majority opinion, which itself noted this history even though the case almost certainly would have come out the same way had the history of anti-Catholic bigotry been different. So it is not as if he disfavors talk of history in general.) In another case, also this term, the Court again acknowledged some of the relevant history of racism in the United States, but it did not get the history quite right, making it sound better than it was. In Comcast Corporation v. National Association of African American\u2013Owned Media , the Court held that a plaintiff who sues for racial discrimination in contracting under a federal law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, has to show that race was not just a motivating factor, but a but-for cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. It is much harder to prove but-for causation, which is why a major corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Trump administration wanted this requirement, while civil-rights groups opposed it. This case obviously had to do with potential racism: It was expressly about proving certain claims of racial discrimination. What is less obvious is that Congress originally passed Section 1981 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, after the Civil War, to protect certain rights of formerly enslaved people. Concerns about whether the Thirteenth Amendment (which ended slavery) permitted Congress to pass this law led to the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment (which, among other things, includes a guarantee of constitutional equality). What is also less obvious is how narrow was the understanding of racial equality embraced by the Congress that passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Court in Comcast said that the law had been passed \u201cto vindicate the rights of former slaves.\u201d Sadly, the history is more complicated and depressing. The law was passed to protect the civil rights of formerly enslaved people, such as contracting, suing, and owning property. Civil rights for Black Americans at that time did not include political rights such as voting (hence the need for the Fifteenth Amendment) or social rights such as attending public schools with white children and marrying white people (rights\u2014to America\u2019s national shame\u2014not protected by the Court until 1954 and 1967, respectively). These distinctions among civil, political, and social equality, which are not required by the text of the Constitution and no longer exist in U.S. constitutional law, were intended both to grant some measure of equality to the citizens who had been slaves and to strictly limit how much and what kind. By describing Section 1981 in sweeping terms, the Court failed to acknowledge the more sobering portions of the relevant history. It would have been interesting to see the Court respond to a constitutional challenge to affirmative action or to the Voting Rights Act in the current political climate. But this term does illustrate why, in light of American history, racism and race relations remain the nation\u2019s most enduring domestic crisis. Leah Litman: Progressives\u2019 Supreme Court victories will be fleeting The impulse of most of the justices, most of the time, not to talk about race and racism is not excusable, let alone justifiable, but it is understandable. Why risk making oneself, one\u2019s colleagues, and other audiences uncomfortable or even upset when it is not absolutely necessary to \u201cgo there\u201d? When it comes to the subject of racism in this country, however, saying nothing often is saying something. The general silence of the justices can have spillover effects that produce bad law in cases in which correct interpretation of the Constitution and statutes requires serious engagement with the long, tragic history of racism in this nation\u2014and with its continued existence. For example, a Court more attuned to history and current social reality would not have been as likely to declare that \u201cthings have changed dramatically\u201d and a key part of the Voting Rights Act is no longer constitutionally justified, which is what the Court said and held in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. The Court\u2019s equal-protection jurisprudence in the areas of affirmative action and disparate-impact liability might also look different. But if more often than not the justices can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014grapple with the nation\u2019s racist history and present, then more often than not the law articulated by the Court will continue to be unworthy of the aspiration engraved over the front entrance to the building in which it sits: equal justice under law.","headline":"The Supreme Court Is Avoiding Talking About Race","article_name":614944.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/supreme-court-doesnt-like-talk-about-race\/614944\/","date_published":"2020-08-07 14:43:19","article_length":13639,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:29.541218","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/08\/supreme-court-doesnt-like-talk-about-race\/614944\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"Here are three big takeaways from the new UN-led report, which warns that global warming \u201cis a threat to human well-being and planetary health.\u201d Yesterday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published another one of its tomelike reports on the dangers of global warming. It is, it must be said, a dry and colorless document. Tasked with describing the impacts of climate change on human society and the natural world\u2014which is to say, every living thing\u2014as well as how humanity might adapt to those convulsions, it falls back on phrases such as \u201cecosystems, people, settlements, and infrastructure.\u201d Kraftwerk was more lyrical . The style of every IPCC report is the same: It piles fact upon fact, until the picture is overwhelming. \u201cThe cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,\u201d this one concludes. In order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, humanity must begin to significantly reduce carbon emissions during its \u201cbrief and rapidly closing window\u201d to do so. If countries do not begin to limit their carbon pollution, then global warming could outpace our ability to adapt to it. At this point, that conclusion might seem obvious, and if the IPCC had a different job to do, perhaps it could simply assert: You get it by now . No more reports. Just do something! Its assignment, though, is to be a definitive compilation of human knowledge, so its scope has only grown. Technically, this report and the last one, which came out in August , are linked: They form Volumes I and II, respectively, of the Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change. Volume I looked at the physical and scientific basis of global warming; this update examines its effects on human society and the natural world. A third volume, about how to stop climate change, is due out this spring. The character of climate change\u2019s impacts on human society is coming into greater focus. Although this report is more than 3,500 pages, it reaches three conclusions that can be spelled out here. First, global warming will be costly. Even in an optimistic warming scenario, the population exposed to once-in-a-century flooding will increase by at least 20 percent. Climate change will introduce new supply-chain risks, the report says, particularly for specialized commodities. It will shift fisheries and growing regions from one country to another. Even if humanity holds warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius\u2014which would require aggressive global climate policy\u2014the chance of maize crops failing across much of the world at the same time is increased. Climate change is already impeding economic growth. Over the past 50 years, agricultural productivity has increased, but the authors note (with medium confidence) that climate change may now be slowing that progress down. In North America, climate change has reduced agricultural productivity by 12.5 percent since 1961, the report claims. By the middle of the century, it will be too hot to work outside many days of the year across large swaths of the world. The economic damage will not be limited to professions that require manual labor. By the middle of the century, the skiing and snowboarding season will be shortened across much of North America. (Yes, this is really one of the findings in the report.) And the fount of wealth\u2014human health\u2014will also worsen. This is the report\u2019s second conclusion: A warmer world will be a sicker world. \u201cClimate change has adversely affected physical health of people globally and mental health of people in the assessed regions,\u201d the report concludes. The risks of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral illness, will increase on every continent except Antarctica and Australia. Chikungunya virus will also spread more widely. Viruses like the coronaviruses that cause SARS or COVID-19, which leap from animals to people, are popping up in new areas. The risk of water-borne diseases has increased in certain regions, as has the risk of toxic algae blooms. Parts of the world have gotten dustier and smokier, worsening heart and lung health. The report also examines how humans could adapt to climate change. And in that sense, it makes history: as the first of any IPCC report to summarize research on geoengineering. The report looks at solar-radiation management and some forms of carbon removal. Solar-radiation management, it concludes, introduces so many new risks that it is not yet well understood. But the type of geoengineering the report seems most concerned about is planting trees. That may be surprising. Don\u2019t trees absorb carbon dioxide as a matter of course? Aren\u2019t they nature\u2019s climate solution? So they are. And planted in deforested land, they can help lower atmospheric carbon levels. But if they\u2019re planted where other ecosystems, such as prairie or savanna, used to be, then they can degrade water quality, can hurt native plants and animals, and may not even remove carbon at all. These problems can get even worse if the trees are eventually harvested and burned for energy. Over the past decade, scientists have gotten better at describing the human misery of climate change\u2014the floods, the fires, the storms. Their proficiency has improved in part because these disasters have started to arrive in greater numbers. But people are adaptable; we live in homes and have technology at our disposal. Other living things are not as lucky. And this is the report\u2019s third and final conclusion: Many of climate change\u2019s harms are uncountable, unquantifiable, impossible to know, because they will happen in the natural world. As the planet warms, the natural world will degrade. This is not a new idea, but still, it stands out in the report as one of the hardest effects of climate change to reverse. The most hopeful climate scenario now available is that the planet warms more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above its preindustrial temperature by the middle of the century\u2014but then humanity manages to prevent \u201covershoot,\u201d and its mean temperature begins to fall. But even in that story line, alpine glaciers will be lost forever, as will the mountain streams and valleys that thrive on their meltwater. Forests consumed by wildfire will not necessarily grow back in the same way that they were. And under any scenario, global warming will destroy the integrity of Earth\u2019s natural rhythms. It will shift the timing of the seasons, meaning that migratory birds arrive at a habitat too late for a local bloom. It will weaken the function of ecosystems, making them less efficient and useful. And it will worsen water quality and plague the landscape with storms, heat, droughts, and floods. Consider the pain so far. About half of all species worldwide have shifted toward the poles or, among those that live on land, to higher elevations. Climate change has already driven at least one animal, the Bramble Cay melomys , into extinction. The melomys, a small white-flecked rodent, lived on an island near the tip of the Great Barrier Reef. It was the reef\u2019s only native mammal; now it is gone. Climate change also may have helped kill off the golden toad of Costa Rica\u2019s cloud forests , which was last seen 33 years ago, and the wild population of Australia\u2019s white ringtail possum, which perished in a series of heat waves. These extinctions are only the beginning. Even if humanity keeps warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, some 9 percent of species that live on land or in freshwater will likely be \u201cat very high risk of extinction,\u201d the report finds. In \u201cbiodiversity hotspots,\u201d the risks to endemic species will be even higher. Coral reefs, which about half a billion people depend on for their livelihood, will suffer hideous bleaching events under almost any temperature scenario. Nor is the standard toolbox of conservation, namely park creation, doing enough to reduce these risks. Only 15 percent of the planet\u2019s land surface is protected, and most of it is not cared for in a way that will limit the damage a changing climate will do. An IPCC report from several years ago found that human activity now shapes 70 percent of the ice-free surface of the globe. Nature is running out of places to hide. So climate change will make us pay. But it will also deplete the unquantifiable inheritance that is the Earth\u2019s beauty and diversity, and bankrupt us in more ways than we can know. Given that climate change is a solvable problem, one that the United States can make a large dent in on the cheap \u2026 isn\u2019t it time to start?","headline":"A Sicker, Poorer, and Less Abundant World","article_name":623329.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/un-ipcc-climate-change-report-2022\/623329\/","date_published":"2022-03-01 19:55:14","article_length":8521,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:29.925163","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2022\/03\/un-ipcc-climate-change-report-2022\/623329\/","source":"atlantic"}
{"id":null,"body":"The latest UN report is clear: Climate change is here, it\u2019s a crisis, and it\u2019s caused by fossil fuels. A new United Nations\u2013led report from hundreds of climate scientists around the world makes it clear: The human-driven climate crisis is now well under way. Earth is likely hotter now than it has been at any moment since the beginning of the last Ice Age, 125,000 years ago, and the world has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, or nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the Industrial Revolution began\u2014an \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201crapid\u201d change with no parallel in the Common Era. What\u2019s more, the recent spate of horrific heat waves, fire-fueling droughts, and flood-inducing storms that have imperiled the inhabited world are not only typical of global warming, but directly caused by it. Climate change has arrived, in other words, and it will keep getting worse until humanity reduces its greenhouse-gas pollution to zero, which can be accomplished only by dethroning oil, coal, and gas as the central energy sources powering the global economy. But the speed of that transition matters\u2014and preventing every last ton of carbon pollution, and averting every additional tenth of a degree of warming, will not only lessen the harm over the next few decades, but resound for centuries and even millennia to come. These are the conclusions of the newest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a UN-sponsored body that has periodically released a synthesis of current climate science since its founding in 1988. The group\u2019s reports tend to punctuate the otherwise slow immiseration of climate change; its previous synthesis report, released in 2013, helped inform international climate policy, including the writing of the Paris Agreement. This is its sixth report and its most definitive. The group\u2019s findings must be agreed to by 195 countries; this famously makes it more conservative than some scientists believe is prudent. But compared with previous reports, there is little restraint here. In its strongest statement of culpability ever, the IPCC declared that humanity is \u201cunequivocally\u201d responsible for climate change. \u201cIn past reports, we\u2019ve had to make that statement more hesitantly. Now it\u2019s a statement of fact,\u201d Gregory Flato, a vice chair of the group that authored the report and a senior research scientist within the Canadian government, told me. Some of the worst impacts of climate change can still be avoided. \u201cThere are still emissions pathways that would lead us to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but they require deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions,\u201d Flato said. \u201cThat leaves a glimmer of optimism that we could limit warming to levels like that.\u201d But it would require much more expedient action from the United States than is contemplated in, say, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Congress is currently considering. The report is 3,949 pages long and synthesizes the past eight years of advances in climate science; altogether, it cites some 14,000 studies. It would be folly to try to summarize all that work here. But the bottom line is that climate science, and the cataclysm of climate change, has lurched into the present tense. Where scientists once warned of disasters in the distant future, now they strive to understand what has already happened\u2014and what is too late to save. Here are four takeaways: Climate change has been happening now nearly since before it first became a public issue. When James Hansen, the head of climate science at NASA, first warned Congress about climate change in 1988, he framed it in what might be called the tentative present tense, saying that the agency could now say \u201cwith a high degree of confidence\u201d that global warming was under way. And it was. As the new report notes: \u201cEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850.\u201d Yet in the past few years, global warming has moved from a statistical property to an ambient condition of modern life. A mega-drought seems to grip the American West without end. A series of wildfires have passed, like a baton, from one part of the world to another, going from California to the Amazon to Australia to Greece to California again. And then there was the morning, a few weeks ago, when Americans on the East Coast and in the Midwest woke up, thousands of miles away from any wildfire, and smelled smoke in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a point where the impacts of climate change are becoming too hard to ignore for many people,\u201d Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and a co-author of one of the report\u2019s chapters, told me. For the first time, the report establishes that those extreme events are happening because of climate change. Scientists\u2019 ability to attribute individual events to the warming atmosphere is the \u201cbiggest advance\u201d the field has seen in the past decade, Ben Cook, a climate-science professor at Columbia University, told me. \u201cEvery inhabited region across the globe\u201d has seen a well-documented increase in heat waves, heavy rain, or drought, the report says. Human activity is also behind the demise of glaciers since 1990, the hemorrhaging of the Greenland ice sheet, and the decline of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere since 1950, the report says. No part of the world has been left untouched by humanity\u2019s prodigious carbon pollution. In the past decade, climate scientists have arrived at more pessimistic views about sea-level rise, and those views are reflected in this report. Most researchers now believe that the oceans will rise roughly half a foot more than once projected. In a relatively optimistic \u201cintermediate\u201d emissions scenario, for instance, the IPCC once projected that oceans would rise about one and a half feet by 2100. The new report finds that just under two feet is more likely, and two and a half feet is not out of the question. The authors could not eliminate from their models the small chance that some of the largest glaciers in West Antarctica could catastrophically collapse this century. In that scenario, humanity could see more than six and a half feet of sea-level rise by 2100 and perhaps as much as 16 feet of sea-level rise by 2150. If humanity successfully learns how to remove carbon from the atmosphere, some of the impacts of climate change, such as ocean acidification and the rise in land temperatures, may be reversible. But some will not. Sea-level rise is chief among them. \u201cOnce you have melting under way, it\u2019s very hard to rein it in, even if you go full-scale into reversal of global warming,\u201d Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech and a co-author of the report, told me. The slow increase in sea levels could continue for millennia. \u201cWhen I say those words, it almost chokes me up. It scares the crap out of me, frankly,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThis is a horrific long-term consequence to the decisions we\u2019ll be making this decade on our watch.\u201d If climate change is happening now, then its time scales\u2014which once seemed distant\u2014are suddenly ticking by at the speed of the political or business calendars. An earlier draft of this report cautioned that the world could see more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the early 2030s. Although that language was removed because researchers could not guarantee that a fluke event, such as a once-in-a-century volcanic eruption, would not briefly cool the planet and delay the inevitable for a few years, the broad point remains. The IPCC now warns that the world is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040 even if humanity cuts carbon pollution as rapidly as is plausible. In fact, the agency estimates that enough greenhouse gas is already in the atmosphere today to raise the planet\u2019s temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius\u2014only the cooling effects of smog and other forms of conventional air pollution are keeping temperatures depressed. But humanity may still avoid warming the planet by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. On all pathways, the world\u2019s temperature will increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century; the only question is whether it then begins to cool down or keeps going up. Current policies suggest that the planet is set for 3 degrees Celsius, or more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming by the end of the century. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing extreme rainfall, heat waves, and droughts that are all implicitly or explicitly tied to climate change\u2014and this is just a 1-degree world,\u201d Cook said. \u201cI would not want to live in a 4-degree world. And a 3-degree world \u2026 would be quite challenging.\u201d","headline":"It\u2019s Grim","article_name":619698.0,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/08\/latest-ipcc-report-catastrophe\/619698\/","date_published":"2021-08-09 17:52:16","article_length":8559,"date_uploaded":"2023-02-08T09:59:29.932913","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2021\/08\/latest-ipcc-report-catastrophe\/619698\/","source":"atlantic"}
