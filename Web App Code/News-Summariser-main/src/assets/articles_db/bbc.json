{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent, San Francisco This video can not be played Greenland is losing ice seven times faster than it was in the 1990s.  The assessment  comes from an international team of polar scientists who've reviewed all the satellite observations over a 26-year period.  They say Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise is currently tracking what had been regarded as a pessimistic projection of the future. It means an additional 7cm of ocean rise could now be expected by the end of the century from Greenland alone. This threatens to put many millions more people in low-lying coastal regions at risk of flooding.  It's estimated roughly a billion live today less than 10m above current high-tide lines, including 250 million below 1m.  \"Storms, if they happen against a baseline of higher seas - they will break flood defences,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd, of Leeds University. \"The simple formula is that around the planet, six million people are brought into a flooding situation for every centimetre of sea-level rise. So, when you hear about a centimetre rise, it does have impacts,\" he told BBC News. The British scientist is the co-lead investigator for Imbie - the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise. It's a consortium of 89 polar experts drawn from 50 international organisations.  The group has reanalysed the data from 11 satellite missions flown from 1992 to 2018.  These spacecraft have taken repeat measurements of the ice sheet's changing thickness, flow and gravity. The Imbie team has combined their observations with the latest weather and climate models. What emerges is the most comprehensive picture yet of how Greenland is reacting to the Arctic's rapid warming. This is a part of the globe that has seen  a 0.75C temperature rise in just the past decade . This video can not be played The Imbie assessment shows the island to have lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice to the ocean since the start of the study period. This mass is the equivalent of 10.6mm of sea-level rise. What is more, the team finds an acceleration in the data. Whereas in the early 90s, the rate of loss was equivalent to about 1mm per decade, it is now running at roughly 7mm per decade. Imbie team-member Dr Ruth Mottram is affiliated to the Danish Meteorological Institute. She said: \"Greenland is losing ice in two main ways - one is by surface melting and that water runs off into the ocean; and the other is by the calving of icebergs and then melting where the ice is in contact with the ocean. The long-term contribution from these two processes is roughly half and half.\" In an average year now, Greenland sheds about 250 billion tonnes of ice. This year, however, has been exceptional for its warmth. In the coastal town of Ilulissat, not far from where the mighty Jakobshavn Glacier enters the ocean, temperatures reached into the high 20s Celsius. And even in the ice sheet interior, at its highest point, temperatures got to about zero.  \"The ice loss this year was more like 370 billion tonnes,\" said Dr Mottram. Back in 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the authoritative body that reconciles all climate science - gave a mid-range projection for global sea level rise of about 60cm by 2100. A mixture of ice melt and expansion of warming water.  But when  Imbie published its companion review of Antarctica  in 2018, it found the White Continent's contribution by 2100 was likely being underestimated by 10cm. Now, for Greenland, Imbie is saying the shortfall is 7cm. The IPCC will have to incorporate these updates when it releases its next major assessment report (AR6) of Earth's climate in a couple of years' time. Prof Ren\u00e9 Forsberg, from the Technical University of Denmark, said the Imbie exercise underlined the importance of flying satellites, especially those that can observe the top of Greenland, higher than 83 degrees North. Only two of the present fleet can, and one of those spacecraft is operating beyond its design life.   \"Most of the changes we've seen in Greenland have been in the west, south and east; and now it has slowly moved up to the north. So, yes, the next satellite in the European Union's Copernicus programme needs to go to higher latitudes, and this is being discussed by the EU and the European Space Agency,\" Prof Forsberg told BBC News.  The new satellite system -  for the moment known as Cristal , but to be called a Sentinel if it flies - would be a radar altimeter to measure the changing shape of Greenland.  Imbie's Greenland analysis is published in the journal Nature . Its release has been timed to coincide with the annual COP climate convention taking place this year in Madrid, and with the  American Geophysical Union meeting  here in San Francisco, where leading Earth scientists have gathered.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent North Atlantic hurricanes are retaining far more of their strength when they hit land because of global warming, say scientists. Previously, experts believed these storms died down quickly once they made landfall. But over the past 50 years, the time it takes for hurricanes to dissipate on the coast has almost doubled. Researchers says that climate change gives the storms more energy, which continues to power them over land. The scientists involved say that this will likely make hurricanes more damaging further inland in years to come.  This year, the North Atlantic  has already broken the record  for the number of named storms, with Hurricane Theta becoming the 29th storm of the season - beating the 28 that formed in 2005. Experts have noted that in recent years, tropical storms that make land are persisting far longer and doing more damage than in the past. In 2017, Houston, Texas, was inundated when Hurricane Harvey settled over the city for several days, dumping 127 billion tonnes of water on the US' fourth largest city. It was one of the  heaviest precipitation events in the recorded history of hurricanes . Now, researchers have shown that climate change is preventing these storms from decaying quickly when they move onto dry land.  Hurricanes are powered by moisture from warm, tropical oceans - this is the fuel that drives the intense winds that are typical of this type of storm.  Climate change means the air over the oceans can hold more of this moisture, intensifying the storms at sea. But when these storms hit land, the fuel from the seas is cut off and the hurricanes should decay, or dissipate, very quickly. However, this  new study  indicates that is no longer the case. \"We show that hurricanes decay at a slower rate in a warmer climate,\" said Prof Pinaki Chakraborty, from the Okinawa Institute for Science and Technology in Japan, who led the study. \"For North Atlantic land-falling hurricanes, the timescale of decay has almost doubled over the past 50 years.\" \"As to the underlying reason, our analysis suggests that the culprit is climate change.\" The scientists found that in the late 1960s, hurricanes typically lost 75% of their intensity in the first day after landfall.  Nowadays, the decay is only about 50%. The researchers believe that the key to the storms retaining their power is the warm moisture they have picked up along the way. It's working like an extra fuel tank to keep the hurricane active even when it's over dry land. As the world gets warmer, this means that tropical storms will likely stay active for longer and do far more damage inland.  \"We also show, using simulations, that the slower decay is fuelled by an increased amount of moisture that is stocked in the hurricane from its passage over ocean prior to landfall,\" said Prof Chakraborty. \"Unfortunately, our research also suggests that as the climate keeps warming, the decay of hurricanes will keep getting slower, and consequently, regions farther inland will face the wrath of ever stronger storms.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Nature.

{"id":null,"body":"US President Donald Trump has accused climate change scientists of having a \"political agenda\" as he cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. But Mr Trump also said he no longer believed climate change was a hoax. The comments, made during an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, come less than a week after climate scientists issued a final call to halt rising temperatures. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced. Last week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - warned  the world was heading towards a temperature rise of 3C .  Scientists say that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity - which has caused approximately 1C of global warming above pre-industrial levels.  The report said keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\". Climate change was just one issue touched on during the wide-ranging interview , during which Mr Trump also: This video can not be played During Sunday's interview, Mr Trump cast doubt on making any changes, saying the scientists \"have a very big political agenda\". \"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference,\" he told journalist Lesley Stahl.  \"But I don't know that it's manmade. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't want to be put at a disadvantage.\" Mr Trump added that temperatures \"could very well go back\" - although he did not say how. He said climate change was a hoax during his election campaign in 2016 but has generally avoided taking a clear stance on the issue since taking office. However, he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels and \"endeavour to limit\" them even more, to 1.5C.  At the time,  Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal  that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.  It sparked speculation that the former reality television star still believed climate change had been invented. However, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, later said Mr Trump \"believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation\". The report released last week by the IPCC says climate change can only be stopped if the world makes major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7m square miles) for land energy crops. This video can not be played If the world fails to act, the researchers warn, there will be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. By Roger Harrabin BBC Environment Analyst President Trump's views on climate change have swung widely - like his comments on many issues. Vanishingly few informed scientists now disagree that humans have been driving recent climate change, and that further heating will create serious risks for the climate. They don't expect the climate will materially cool again in a natural cycle. The president says he doesn't want to spend trillions of dollars and lose millions of jobs by cutting emissions. Of course he doesn't - but all governments feel the same way. Instead, they are trying to reframe the huge investment needed in renewable energy as a money-making enterprise. The UK's Industrial Strategy, for instance, sets out to create jobs in clean industries to replace those lost in dirty factories. And in the US itself,  the solar industry is creating far more jobs than the coal sector . Does the president know that?

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey has won the race to become the new leader of the Liberal Democrats. The acting leader will now take over on a permanent basis after beating his competitor, fellow MP Layla Moran.  Sir Ed secured 63.5% of the vote, compared to 36.5% for Ms Moran. At an event in London, Sir Ed said it was time for the party to \"wake up and smell the coffee\" after only securing 12% of the vote in the last general election. In an email to party members, he said he would launch a \"national listening project\" to help make the Lib Dems \"relevant again\", adding: \"We won't be able to do this unless we show people we share their values and are on their side.\" The result comes eight months after the Lib Dem's former leader, Jo Swinson, stepped down from the role after losing her seat in 2019 general election. Ms Moran congratulated her opponent on Twitter, saying: \"I look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for Britain.\" Sir Ed has been a member of the Liberal Democrats for 30 years, and acting leader since Ms Swinson left the role in December.  He was elected as an MP in 1997, but lost his seat of Kingston and Surbiton in 2015 after his tenure as a cabinet minister in the coalition government.  In the 2017 snap election, Sir Ed returned to Parliament for the same constituency and will now lead the party's 11 MPs and wider membership.  In his victory speech, the new leader spoke of the task ahead, with the party only achieving single digit support in the the latest opinion polls. \"Nationally our party has lost touch with too many voters,\" he said. \"Yes, we are powerful advocates locally. Our campaigners listen to local people, work hard for communities and deliver results. \"But at the national level. We have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results.\"  He added: \"The truth is, voters don't believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life. \"It is time for us to start listening. And as leader, I have got that message. I am listening now.\" Analysis by Leila Nathoo, BBC political correspondent This was Sir Ed Davey's second attempt to win the Liberal Democrat leadership - he lost out to Jo Swinson last year.   This time round, he comfortably persuaded party members that his years of experience in government and Parliament were in fact an advantage, and a better bet than his challenger's pitch for change.  Sir Ed acknowledged that his task now is to try to restore the party's fortunes.  It has just 11 MPs in the Commons after being punished over three general elections following the coalition with the Conservatives.  And the wave of defections during the heady days of the Brexit process turned out to be a flash in the pan.  The Liberal Democrats' Remain position was rejected by voters in 2019, and, now in a post-Brexit world - and with the Labour party too under new management - Sir Ed will be looking to move on.  He will hope that his focus on climate change can redefine the Lib Dems and help them regain national relevance one again. Sir Ed also thanked Ms Moran for her \"passionate campaign\" and promised the education spokeswoman a \"big role\" in his team.  Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron congratulated Sir Ed on his win, calling him a \"fantastic campaigner who has the experience and vision to move our party forward\". And fellow MP Wera Hobhouse, who pulled out of the leadership race, said she looked forward to \"a new positive future for our party\". The Lib Dems originally planned to delay the contest to succeed Ms Swinson until May 2021. But the party brought it forward following criticism from party members. The two-month contest began in June, but most hustings and meetings  had to take place virtually due to coronavirus.  The party issued 117,924 ballots for the contest - the largest number in its history - and turnout was 57.6%. Sir Ed won with 42,756 votes, while Ms Moran got 24,564 votes. The margin was the largest of a Lib Dem leadership winner since the late Paddy Ashdown secured 71% of his party's vote in 1988.

{"id":null,"body":"By Bjorn Schionning Business reporter Greenland is not used to being the centre of attention, but last year it made the front pages of newspapers around the world. It came after US President Donald Trump confirmed news reports that he wanted the US to buy the vast Arctic island from Denmark. The Danish government immediately replied that Greenland was not for sale, and it led to a diplomatic spat. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the US wish \"absurd\", which led to Mr Trump  countering that her comments were  . The two sides soon patched up their differences though, and the US announced a different policy to increase its presence and influence in Greenland - it is going to open a consulate there later this year. It will be its first in the territory since 1953, although the US continues to run a military facility in the north of Greenland - Thule Air Base. Coming as China is also keen to establish closer economic ties with Greenland, why is the island suddenly so in demand? And what could the new US consulate mean for both Greenland's economy, and the territory's independence movement? But first, a brief guide to Greenland. Nine times bigger than the UK, it is the world's largest island if Australia is considered to be a continent. Located mostly within the Arctic Circle, some three quarters of the land is permanently covered in an ice sheet. With a population of about 56,000, it is the least densely populated country or territory on Earth. It makes the likes of Namibia and Mongolia seem a bit busy. A third of people live in the capital Nuuk, and there are no roads to the other towns, which hug the coast. Instead you have to fly or go by boat, both of which are often not possible during winter. Owned by Denmark since 1814, Greenland is an autonomous territory with its own parliament which takes care of domestic matters. The Danish parliament in Copenhagen, to which Greenland sends two MPs, looks after its international affairs. Currently Greenland's economy is reliant upon two things; fishing, which accounts for 95% of its exports, and an annual grant from the Danish government. This subsidy totals 3.9bn Danish kroner ($600m; \u00a3450m), and provides more than half of the yearly budget of the Greenland government. Commentators say that there are two reasons why Greenland is now enthusiastically eyed by the US and China - economic and strategic. And both are linked to climate change. Economically, Greenland has some of the largest deposits of so called rare earth metals, such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium. These are increasingly used in the manufacturing of mobile phones, computers and electric cars. And strategically, the country lies between North America, Europe and Russia.  Climate change and specifically warmer temperatures mean that it might become easier to both mine those metals and navigate through the surrounding Arctic Ocean, be it in a cargo ship or military vessel. Danish geologist Minik Rosing says that Greenland has many more treasures lying under its surface. \"There is also iron ore... there is a ruby mine... there is gold... there is platinum,\" he says. \"And climate change does make sailing a lot easier [to and from Greenland].\" Yet he cautions that the long Arctic winters still severely limit mining in Greenland. \"You can only do prospecting work for a mine in Greenland in the summer, for three months a year or so. \"That means that the time from when you discover an occurrence, till you can have a decent mine production, takes a very long time.\" So rather than economic reasons, Mr Rosing thinks the US is eyeing Greenland because of its growing strategic importance. \"I think that most of the US interest is due to strategic reasons, they simply want to be present,\" he says. \"The minerals play a minor part in that.\" While the Danish government declined to comment for this article, opposition Danish MP Soren Espersen says he is concerned that the US consulate in Greenland will increase calls in Greenland for independence.  Currently polls on the issue are inconclusive, with some suggesting that as many as 64% of Greenlanders want the country to separate from Denmark, while others have put it as low as 38%. More from the  BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: \"The Americans want to be ready when Greenland declares its independence,\" says Mr Espersen from the right-wing Danish People's Party. \"The Americans are adding fuel to the Greenlandic wish of independence.\" He adds that he wants to see the Danish government do more to show that it is \"more serious\" about keeping Greenland. Mr Espersen also does not want to see China have any influence or presence in Greenland. The Danish government appears to agree on this, and in 2017 agreed to build two new airports in Greenland instead of the deal going to a Chinese company. Aaja Chemnitz Larsen is one of the two MPs from Greenland that sit in the Danish parliament. She is from the pro-independence and socialist Inuit Ataqatigiit party. While she says \"it is good to have a good co-operation with the Americans\", she is concerned about how many staff may be present in the forthcoming US consulate. \"I am worried about it because there shall probably be more American diplomats in that consulate than we have staff in the Greenlandic Foreign Directorate.\" Her concern is that the American presence might become too dominant. \"We could be out-run,\" she says. The US embassy in Copenhagen did not get back to requests for a comment. Ms Chemnitz Larsen adds that while independence for Greenland is her long-term aim, \"I do not believe it is just around the corner. \"[And] I do not believe we should sell ourselves to those who pay a lot, whether it is the US or China, to get out of the unity of the [Danish] realm. That is not independence.\" Danish economist Uffe Palludan agrees that Greenlanders should be concerned about letting in too much American - or Chinese - investment. \"It would have a huge destabilizing impact on Greenlandic society,\" he says.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Molloy Technology reporter Microsoft is poised to launch its game streaming service, delivering high-end titles direct to phones - and Google already offers an equivalent service. Cloud gaming promises top-tier graphics and performance without the expensive hardware - with no more massive updates or downloads. But some studies suggests it could be more damaging to the planet.  One recent study from Lancaster University estimated that if gamers moved to streaming over the next decade, carbon emissions could rise by 30%. Instead of having a high-end PC or games console in the home, cloud gaming platforms run the software from a remote data centre. All the graphics and sounds are streamed to a TV or mobile device over the internet. It's interactive - so unlike video streaming, those graphics and sounds are tailored to each player. And the internet itself uses a lot of power.  \"There are a lot of things that have to spring into action,\" explains Mike Hazas, one of the Lancaster University researchers. Home wi-fi routers are just the first step, and we can't see most of it: the street corner communications exchange, miles of fibre-optic cable, core network infrastructure and - ultimately - the data centre. All told, it involves \"hundreds of computers, probably thousands\", says Mr Hazas. The Lancaster University study looked  at three scenarios - one where streaming remains niche, as now, a middle ground, and one where 90% of gamers end up gradually switching to streaming over the next decade. After the decade-long transition, they estimated emissions would be 30% higher per year from 2030 in the high-streaming scenario compared to a low-streaming one. Such estimates are a matter of debate, and some academics told the BBC the assumptions for some figures used are too high. The Lancaster team also tried to offset the emissions tally by accounting for the carbon savings of fewer plastic consoles being manufactured - another rough estimate. They also point out that their assumptions are based on game streaming at modern standard 720p and 1080p resolutions.  \"If streaming at 4K resolution becomes widespread, then it may well be game over,\" the study warns. \"Despite the images of invisibility and purity conjured up by the word 'cloud', it is in reality populated with intense amounts of energy-using hardware,\" says Evan Mills, who headed up  the Green Gaming project at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . And while his assumptions in 2016 were different from the Lancaster team, Mr Mills did come to similar conclusions. Mr Mills had two scenarios - one in which only 20% of gaming was done using a cloud by 2021, and another where 75% of gaming time was streamed.  The cloud gaming scenario would use 17% more energy overall, he concluded. This video can not be played For example, a 10-watt streaming device - like a media stick plugged into a TV - can use an extra 520 watts of power in the network and data centre - making the total greater than local desktop PCs, Mr Mills' team found.  In addition, a console, on average, uses 156% more energy when cloud gaming compared to local gaming - and far more than watching a film on a video stream.  They estimate roughly 300 watts of power is used in the data centre, and about 182 watts are spent on all the internet infrastructure in the middle - for every connected gamer. \"Cloud-based gaming is by far the most energy-intensive form of gaming via the internet,\"  the team concluded. There are arguments in favour of cloud gaming, however. Gamers could use lower-powered, more energy-efficient devices at home, since all the heavy lifting is done in a data centre. And fewer consoles being manufactured means fewer in landfill at the end of their useful lives.  There are also no discs to make, and the cost of transporting them to physical stores vanishes.  Digital game downloads have already been replacing physical copies over time - but they have some of the same problems as streaming. \"Download sizes actually give streaming a run for its money,\" Mr Hazas says. Some popular titles are more than 100 gigabytes in size  - a long and power-hungry download process that streaming does not require. At lower resolutions \"it might be in some cases actually be better to stream\", he adds. Microsoft says its cloud gaming servers \"are more power efficient than a standard home console\" and highlights that each server is shared by multiple users \"which creates significant energy reduction\". Google says its data centres - such as the ones that run its Stadia gaming product - are twice as energy efficient as the average data centre.  And both say all their data centres are carbon neutral.  Being carbon neutral is a complex topic, but most major companies achieve it by buying carbon credits - investing in \"green\" projects to offset their emissions.  Shadow, a French firm which provides users with fully functional Windows PCs that they can access through the cloud, said it was very aware of the potential environmental impact. But \"overall, we are convinced that our model is much more sustainable than the old one, in which we multiplied devices that were always more rapidly obsolete,\" a spokesman said. Researchers doubt the efficiency gains in data centres are enough to offset the energy demands of game streaming - but admit they don't know exactly how the inside of corporate data centres work. \"A lot of stuff is secret,\" Mr Hazas says \"so these things are really hard to model\". But things may yet improve. The Lancaster study acknowledged that it cannot predict what  energy-efficient technology might lie ahead. This video can not be played \"There is a long history of detractors spinning factually incorrect stories about the internet's energy use. \"But it's also the case that improvements in efficiency have been offset by increased internet traffic,\" Mr Mills explains. That is the opportunity - and the problem - for a cloud gaming future: more demand means more stress on the network, and any efficiency gains will have to improve at the same pace.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst This video can not be played A frequent flyer tax, phasing out polluting SUVs and restricting cars in city centres are among climate change solutions suggested by members of the public. A citizens' assembly of 108 people from all walks of life published its report after weeks of debate. They proposed curbing road building and using the pandemic to cut emissions. MPs said the report offered a \"unique insight\", but activists Extinction Rebellion said it didn't go far enough. The report says the government must show leadership on climate change and insists climate policies must be fair to all \u2013 especially the poorest in society. Its radical conclusions may offer political cover to ministers who\u2019re typically nervous of a public backlash against policies that affect lifestyles. The group, or  citizens' assembly,  was set up by six government select committees - groups of MPs who look at what the government is doing and scrutinise policy.  Members of the assembly were chosen to represent a spectrum of views from all over the UK and committed 60 hours of their time to studying and debating climate change.  They met over six weekends and were asked how to come up with ideas to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Their conclusions have been published in a report that is more than 550 pages. The members said it was \"imperative that there is strong and clear leadership from government\u201d to tackle climate change. One member, Sue, from Bath, said: \u201cEven with the country still reeling from coronavirus, it\u2019s clear the majority of us feel prioritising net zero policy is not only important, but achievable.\u201d Hamish, a software engineer from rural Aberdeenshire, told BBC News the government needed \"to develop a long-term strategy to help us\u201d. A key theme of the report is education. Ibrahim, a GP from Surrey, said: \u201cThe media has to take a role - schools as well. We perhaps need to look at the curriculum.  \u201cYou can\u2019t go to someone and say \u2018you need to switch to the hydrogen boiler because it\u2019s low CO2\u2019 but they have no idea [about it]. You\u2019re more likely to get a buy-in from people when they know about the issues.\u201d This video can not be played Members said the government should start phasing out the sale of polluting new vehicles such as SUVs, and clamp down on adverts for highly-polluting goods. Another central message is the need for policies to be fair. Amanda, from Kent, said: \u201cElectric cars have to be more affordable to everybody - not just people who earn enough money.\u201d  They also supported higher taxes on frequent fliers, and investment in clean aviation technology.  Tracey, a mother from Northern Ireland, said: \u201cI would be a frequent flier myself \u2013 so I would say there needs to be something there to stop us from taking so many flights \u2013 to reduce our emissions.\u201d On the subject of what we eat and how we use the land, the assembly urged a voluntary cut of 20-40% in eating red meat. \u201cThe government can't legislate against eating red meat,\" Amanda told us, \"but with education, advertising and labelling I think we can change their attitudes towards eating red meat - as we did with smoking.\" They also said: Most members were not very keen on nuclear - or on burning wood in power stations - and most weren\u2019t confident in carbon capture and storage. They think the government should be harnessing the Covid crisis to limit support for high-carbon industries. The MPs behind the assembly said the report \"provides a unique insight into the thinking of an informed public to the trade-offs and changes required to help deliver on the objective that parliament has agreed\". They said: \"Their work merits action.\u201d Crispin Truman, from the countryside charity CPRE, said it shows \"public appetite to end the UK\u2019s contribution to the climate emergency has far outstripped government action.\u201d And Tom Burke, from the climate change think tank, e3g, added: \u201cThis is a striking tribute to the common sense of the British public. There is a clear lesson for politicians and editors across the political spectrum about the role our citizens are capable of playing in shaping public policy.\u201d However, radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) condemned the proposals as too timid to meet internationally-agreed proposals limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. They warned that the report could get buried in government bureaucracy. The committees behind the report have asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to respond before the end of the year.  This may be challenging as, according to a recent report by the Institute for Government, Covid and Brexit have forced climate change down the government\u2019s priority list - a claim the government denies. A government spokesperson said it would study the report. The organisers of the assembly have requested that only first names of members are used in the media.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned. Prof Sir Ian Boyd said the public had little idea of the scale of the challenge from the so-called  Net Zero emissions target . However, he said technology would help. The conundrum facing the UK - and elsewhere - was how we shift ourselves away from consuming, he added. In an interview with BBC News, Sir Ian warned that persuasive political leadership was needed to carry the public through the challenge. Asked whether Boris Johnson would deliver that leadership, he declined to comment. Mr Johnson has already been accused by environmentalists of talking up electric cars whilst reputedly planning a cut in driving taxes that would increase emissions and undermine the electric car market. Sir Ian said polluting activities should incur more tax. He believes the Treasury should reform taxation policy to reward people with low-carbon lifestyles and nudge heavy consumers into more frugal patterns of behaviour. It was vital, he said, for the changes to be fair to all parts of society. He also believes Net Zero won't happen unless the government creates a Net Zero ministry to vet the policies of all government departments in the way the Brexit ministry vets Brexit-related decisions. Emissions won't be reduced to Net Zero while ministers are fixed on economic growth measured by GDP, instead of other measures such as environmental security and a relatively stable climate, he argued.  Asked why the UK should take the lead when China's emissions are so high, he answered that the Chinese government was very worried about the climate and was taking it very seriously. Sir Ian, a polar expert with a chair in biology at St Andrews University, suggested that the UK was in a good position to show the world how to achieve Net Zero. But he agreed that similar radical action was ultimately needed by all nations. He said that on broader issues the government had produced (or was in the process of producing) impressive strategies on the environment, waste, air pollution, marine and food.  Some ministers were enthusiastic to translate these into firm strategies, but they needed support from the public, he said. He confessed that he was not optimistic about the future of the planet because so many systems of government needed to change in a short time. Sir Ian, who leaves Defra on Thursday after seven years in post, said: \"The way we live our lives is generally not good for the environment. \"We like to consume things, but the more we consume the more we absorb the resources of the planet. \"That means we have to grow those resources or we have to mine them - and in doing that we generate waste. And consumption is going up all the time. \"(There's) a conundrum - how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don't really know what it means. \"We need to make major technological advances in the way we use and reuse materials but we (also) need to reduce demand overall - and that means we need to change our behaviours and change our lifestyles. \"We certainly won't be able to travel so much as we have in the past, so we have to get used to using modern communications methods.  \"Moving material round the planet will be more difficult so we'll have to do more with 3D printing; that sort of thing.  \"We've got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don't reduce demand we're not going to reduce emissions.  \"Emissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we'll not reduce emissions.  \"It will very rarely come down to a direct message like 'sorry, you can't buy that but you can buy this'. But there will be stronger messages within the (tax) system that make one thing more attractive than the other.\" He said UK government strategies were in place on air, environment, resources, waste, marine, and food. \"[Ministers] need to be persuasive.\" Asked if he was optimistic about the future of the planet, he said: \u201cWe have the intelligence to do it; we have the potential to develop the technologies to do it\u2026 I\u2019m doubtful that we have the governance structures to make it happen at the speed it needs to happen at.\" Richard Black, from the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Sir Ian's words were \"somewhat surprising\".  He added: \"They appear to contradict the mass of evidence assembled on getting to Net Zero, including the major report from the government's statutory adviser the Committee on Climate Change.\" I understand that the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, accept there will have to be behavioural change to meet Net Zero.  A source in the organisation said they were frustrated that government climate policies were currently too weak. Given the very broad nature of Sir Ian's comments, we approached Downing Street for a comment. They declined and passed us back to Sir Ian's department, Defra. But their statement didn't address any of his key questions about governance, leadership and consumption.  It said: \"The impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 - but we know there is more to do. \"That's why we're reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Getting countries to cut down greenhouse gases that cause global warming is proving an uphill task. But convincing them to clean their air for public health has been easier - and that could help fight climate change as well, UN officials have told the BBC. They say an international effort to cut down air pollution is showing some promise with regards to warming gases. The global effort to tackle emissions will be debated on Monday at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition was formed by six countries. The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) hosts the secretariat of the coalition, which was formed in 2012 and today counts more than 100 governments as members. \"We have seen that countries are forthcoming to join this initiative as it is about immediate public health,\" says Jian Liu, Unep's chief scientist. \"And it has co-benefits: air quality and the climate.\" So, can we really tackle both problems with a single effort? While some of the gases tick both boxes, others are air pollutants without a warming effect, and vice versa. When scientists talk about cutting down greenhouse gases that are blamed for warming the planet, they are mainly targeting carbon dioxide (CO2). That is because it amounts to nearly two-thirds of emissions and can stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. Last year, it reached 411 parts per million (ppm) at Hawaii's Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, the highest monthly average ever recorded. Some experts say 350ppm is the safe limit while others argue 400ppm should be the reasonable target. Burning of fossil fuels, wood and solid waste leads to CO2 emissions. Some industrial processes and land-use changes, including deforestation, also lead to emission of this major greenhouse gas. But because the world's economy still largely runs on fossil fuels, energy politics has severely hindered progress in CO2 emissions reduction to fight climate change. But scientists say there are other gases that pollute the air and also warm the planet. This video can not be played Black carbon and methane are air pollutants that are also responsible for 30-40% of global warming, according to atmospheric scientists with Unep. The sectors that produce the vast majority of greenhouse gases - energy, transport, industry, agriculture, waste management and land use - are also the main sources of these air pollutants. So curbing their emissions, experts say, will help people's health and also that of the planet. They are also known as Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SCLP). \"Acting swiftly to reduce SCLP emissions will benefit human health immediately and slow the rate of near-term warming - benefits that will mostly be felt in the regions where emissions are reduced,\" according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO). SLCP emissions could reduce warming by as much as 0.6C by 2050, it adds, while avoiding 2.4 million premature deaths from ambient air pollution annually by 2030. The UN health agency estimates that air pollution inside and outside the home contributes to around seven million premature deaths worldwide. More than four million of these deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution. The most common outdoor air pollutants are fine airborne particles, which are broken down into categories known as PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, based on size. Respiratory infections, heart disease, lung cancer and even brain development impairment have been linked to PM2.5. These are fine particles, measuring one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair, that can reach lungs and bloodstream if inhaled. While particulate matter counts as an air pollutant, one of its components - black carbon - is a short-lived climate pollutant. Its deposition on snowfields has also been blamed for absorbing sunlight and accelerating melting. There are currently no national or international regulatory obligations to monitor, measure or report releases of black carbon, WHO officials say. Another invisible combination of pollutants is ground level ozone that comes from traffic, landfill, agriculture and other sources. One of ozone's precursors is nitrogen oxide, which comes from fossil fuel combustion. This has been liked to bronchitis in asthmatic children, reducing their lung function. But it is also a greenhouse gas. For more on the UK's efforts to tackle CO2 emissions, download the BBC Briefing on energy. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, it has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. \"The theory that if you cut down air pollution, it will help in reducing emissions of some of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change is quite sound,\" said Lesley Ott, an atmospheric scientist with Nasa. \"So, for instance, if you could make your power plants less polluting, you cut down emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as reduce air pollution. \"But you will still have to tackle the issue of cutting down CO2 emissions because that is the main greenhouse gas we are emitting and that remains in the atmosphere for long time.\" Experts say the Paris climate agreement does not require countries to report on their steps to reduce SLCPs. Under the agreement that aims to keep global warming well below two degrees compared to pre-industrial times, countries are required to submit reports on their actions to mitigate climate change. It is legally non-binding requirement. \"Meeting the targets of the Paris agreement is likely impossible without cutting SLCP emissions,\" said Jian Liu. Although UN officials are glad that countries support cutting down air pollutants that could also lead to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, they admit lack of reporting and monitoring remains a major challenge.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The European Union says it is aiming to become the first major economy to go \"climate neutral\" by 2050.  Under the plan, emissions of greenhouse gases after that date would have to be offset by planting trees or by burying the gases underground. Scientists say that net-zero emissions by 2050 are needed to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures under 1.5C this century. The EU says the move will also cut premature air pollution deaths by 40%.  Climate neutrality means your emissions are balanced by methods of removing warming gases from the atmosphere. So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground.  Getting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position. Since 1990 the EU has cut its emissions by over 20% while the economies of member states have continued to grow. They have set themselves much harder targets for 2030 of cutting emissions by 40% - The EU says it will achieve this target but now plans to go much further again by becoming climate neutral by 2050. The EU have set out  eight scenarios for member states to cut warming gases  - two of these strategies would see Europe become climate neutral. The EU says that this can be done with existing technologies such as solar and wind energy which would have to be ramped up to provide 80% of electricity. Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century. \"With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,\" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \"We have all the tools to be ambitious.\" The EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year. The IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a \"wake-up call\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours.  The UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030.  With global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news.  \"If we do not lead, no one else will,\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete. Not quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.  Some countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spain  have written a letter to the EU  asking for a \"clear direction\" towards net-zero emissions. Climate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough.  They are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial. They also want the net-zero date brought forward.  \"We are calling for 2040 as the time that would be most in line with safer scenarios to keep temperatures under 1.5C,\" said Wendel Trio from Climate Action Network Europe.  \"Going to net-zero by 2050 as the Commission proposes might need a lot of reliance on carbon removal techniques, there are lots of proposals but it is not clear that it can actually happen.\" Sweden has legislated to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. Other countries are looking at it, including the UK  which has asked the Committee on Climate Change  to report on the idea.   The EU says there needs to be a debate among member states about how to achieve this long term goal. The plan is to adopt and submit the ambitious strategy to the UN by early 2020. However any further development could be held up by the fact that a new EU commission will be selected next year.

{"id":null,"body":"\"Do we really need 27 scene changes? Do we need cars hanging from the ceiling?\" It might not be an obvious question for a superstar agent to be raising, but it's one Emma Banks, who co-founded the UK arm of one of the world's biggest music tour agents, is increasingly having to ask. She says your favourite artist's tours can have up to 60 trucks moving equipment all over the world. And she says musicians \"have to be proactive\" about the impact tours like that have on the environment.  Emma's roster at the Creative Artists Agency ranges from other female superstars like Katy Perry, Lorde and Kylie to some of the biggest bands on the planet - including Arcade Fire, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day and Muse. \"The more shows you have, the more environmental impact it has.   \"We need to think more about how we can actually not create the problem in the first place,\" Emma tells BBC Music Introducing's Does My Music Suck? podcast. At any given moment it's likely one of those artists is on a world tour - flying around the world playing to thousands of fans every night. Emma's never had an act turn down a world tour because of its impact on the environment but hopes that will change soon. As fans become more conscious of their impact on the planet, there's more pressure on artists to show that they care about the impact they're having too. \"Everybody, unless you're under a rock, is bombarded by [climate change] on the TV, on the news, in the newspapers... people are talking about it.  \"We have to be proactive.\" Emma admits \"change will be gradual\" but says \"every little helps\".  \"If everyone that's doing a huge tour cut five trucks, that would make an impact.  \"It's not going to make as much impact as if you didn't have any trucks, but we can't go and watch people in the dark with no microphones. That's not going to work.\" Emma says she's discussed the environmental cost of touring with lots of her acts - and recognises finding ways to reduce their carbon footprint \"is a really tricky one\". \"While I certainly don't want to be putting anybody out of business, I think we have to start being realistic and going, 'OK, let's just dial it down a bit'.\" Although it's difficult to calculate the exact impact of each individual tour, a  2016 report  on the impact of live music events suggested the UK festival scene produced 19,778 tonnes of carbon emissions every year - excluding the travel of artists and fans. In comparison, football tournament Euro 2016  is reported  to have produced a total on 2.8m tonnes, including travel of fans and players.   It's also been suggested that private jets, which  many artists use to keep up with their hectic tour schedules , burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights.  Some artists have announced plans to reduce the impact of their tours.  The 1975's label Dirty Hit will donate \u00a31 from every ticket they sell to One Tree Planted, a non-profit organisation that plants trees all over the world. Billie Eilish is banning plastic straws and offering fans a chance to win tickets by fighting climate change.  The singer has also announced a Billie Eilish Eco-Village at each show - an area where fans can learn about climate change and the importance of making a difference.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice President Donald Trump's words and actions are restricting global efforts to cut carbon, according to a new study. The analysis says the withdrawal by the US from the Paris climate agreement has created the political cover for others to go slow on their commitments. The author says the world is in denial about President Trump's true impact.  The study comes as delegates begin two weeks of UN-led talks here on the future of the Paris pact. President Trump has justified pulling his country out of the landmark climate agreement by asserting that he was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris.  However, other international leaders promised that there would be no going back, and that the US pull-out would galvanise efforts to cut carbon.   The sense of unity was underlined in November 2017 when Syria signed the Paris agreement, leaving the US alone in the world as the only country rejecting the deal.  This video can not be played But this new report, from the Institute of International and European Affairs, suggests that President Trump's words and deeds are causing \"very real damage\" to the Paris agreement. The author outlines three key areas where the Trump effect is having an impact.  Under the president, US federal environmental regulations on oil, gas and coal have been rolled back and, as a result, some of the dirtiest fossil fuel projects have become more attractive to investors.  The author says that the US withdrawal from Paris has created the \"moral and political cover for others to follow suit\", citing the examples of Russia and Turkey - which have both declined to ratify the Paris deal.  The US pull-out has also \"severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations\", something that's crucial to progress in these talks here in Poland.  When it comes to fossil fuels, the author cites the example of investments in the coal sector by 36 US banks, which saw a decline of 38% in 2016 after the Paris agreement was signed, but which rose by 6% in 2017 after President Trump was sworn in.  \"This is not a coincidence, there is something underpinning these trends and that's political signals,\" said Joseph Curtin, a senior fellow at the IIEA. \"The Paris agreement sent a shiver down the spine of institutional investors globally and made them question if they were exposed to stranded assets and whether these political leaders were really serious about climate change.\"  \"There's absolutely no doubt that the Trump effect has created a sense of uncertainty in terms of the political commitment to achieve anything close to a two degree C target.\" The switch to coal and oil investments has hurt renewable energy investment in the US and this has had a global knock-on effect, the author says.  On the political front, Russia, Turkey, Australia and Brazil have all cited the example of President Trump to limit their actions on climate change. Russia and Turkey have said they will not ratify the agreement.  The newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has sent mixed messages about climate change. But in recent days, his government has ruled out hosting next year's major climate conference.  The impact of populist governments on the climate change agenda was also highlighted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking recently to the BBC. \"It is clear to me that the world is more polarised, we have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections or having strong election results,\" he said. \"We see the trust between public opinion and institutions and also international organisations being eroded and this has led, in my opinion, to a lack of the necessary political will.\" While the EU, China and India have promised to take more ambitious steps to bolster the Paris agreement, study author Joseph Curtin believes they will be reluctant to take major steps without the participation of the US. \"There's no way that the big player will upgrade their ambition without some sort of quid pro quo from the US,\" he told BBC News.  \"The likelihood that they will take on more ambitious pledges in the short term has certainly been damaged.\" However, some of those involved in the UN climate process argue that to focus on the impacts of Trump is mistaken.  \"It's not just about political leaders in Brazil and the US,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme.  \"The world has seven billion people and over 190 nations, so they are not the entire story - there has been extraordinary leadership on this issue by India and China, countries that 10 years ago were being pilloried for not acting on climate change.\"  The author of the new study says that the Paris deal will survive in the short term. \"But in the longer term, without US support, the Paris agreement won't ultimately be effective and we should be honest about that.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Mark Kinver Environment reporter, BBC News It is increasingly unlikely that global warming will be kept below an increase of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, a study suggests. Data show that global CO2 emissions in 2012 hit 35.6bn tonnes, a 2.6% increase from 2011 and 58% above 1990 levels. The researchers say that emissions are the largest contributor to future climate change and a strong indicator of potential future warming. The findings have been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Meanwhile, the data has been published in the journal Earth System Science Data Discussions. Many low-lying nations have used the UN conference, which is currently under way in Doha, to call for a threshold temperature rise less than 2C, arguing that even a 2C rise will jeopardise their future. \"These latest figures come amidst climate talks in Doha, but with emissions continuing to grow, it's as if no-one is listening to the scientific community,\" said Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia. \"I am worried that the risks of dangerous climate change are too high on our current emissions trajectory,\" Prof Le Quere said. \"We need a radical plan.\" The researchers' paper says the average increases in global CO2 levels were 1.9% in the 1980s, 1.0% in the 1990 but 3.1% since 2000. Recently, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  hit a new record high  in 2011. In its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the organisation said that carbon dioxide levels reached 391 parts per million in 2011. The report estimated that carbon dioxide (CO2) accounted for 85% of the \"radiative forcing\" that led to global temperature rises. Other potent greenhouse gases such as methane also recorded new highs, according to the WMO report.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst We know that climate change harms people but policies to tackle climate change can harm people too. And typically it's the poorest who're most likely to suffer from lost jobs in dirty industries and higher energy bills. In Scotland, for instance, they made thousands of workers jobless when the coal mines closed over the last 30 years. Now they're looking to wean themselves off oil and gas to protect the climate. An expert group known as the Just Transition Commission has been touring the country hearing stories from people whose jobs aren't wanted in a clean tech world. Rab McKenzie is a retired energy worker who lives near Kincardine in what used to be the Scottish coal belt.  His father helped him into the local mine when he left school. He then switched from one pit to another, before ending up at Longannet power station, where he hoped to work until retirement. Some hope. Longannet closed when Rab was 56. \u201cAt my age I was struggling to get a job,\u201d he told me. People didn't want you. You were on the scrapheap. It was not great - I\u2019ve not had a job since.\u201d There\u2019s little employment now for the children growing up in Kincardine. And the village itself \u2013 like Rab - is growing old.  Politicians round the world need to ensure Rab\u2019s experience isn\u2019t replicated thousands of times over as nations shift away from coal, oil and gas.  Tom Connell is an accidental poster boy for the principles of the just transition.  He joined Cockenzie power station near Edinburgh when he was 16, but it was soon shut down and he was laid off. \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d he told me. \u201cA terrible shock.\u201d He shifted to an apparently secure controller job at Longannet, but faced the dole again when that plant closed.  Tom was offered another job in energy - but at Whitelee wind farm near Glasgow, one-and-a-half hours from home. His pay would be cut by \u00a32,000 a year.  He took it. Now Tom\u2019s new office window surveys an array of slender turbines on tussocky moorland. It\u2019s a relief, he says. \u201cWorking in the coal it was always dirty \u2013 coal dust and oil,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd there was no window in the control room so you would never see the daylight. I like it up here \u2013 you\u2019ve actually got a window.\u201d But what about the pay cut or the relocation? \u201cTo me it was worth it for the job security,\u201d he says.  But how do governments ensure that the move away from fossil fuels replicates Tom\u2019s story, not Rab\u2019s? Charlotte Hartley is a member of the Scottish Just Transition Commission, studying how cities like Aberdeen can prise themselves away from dependency on oil and gas.  I met her in Aberdeen Maritime Museum \u2013 a reminder that the city\u2019s economy already made one huge transition away from fishing, a natural resource that has mostly disappeared.    She told me the clean industrial revolution is already underway. \u201cSome oil and gas firms in Aberdeen and globally have re-branded,\u201d she said.  \u201cTheir portfolio is significantly expanded, so I think there\u2019s going to be no such thing as an oil and gas company \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a far broader energy business. \u201cOne company in Aberdeen will be working on a number of different departments \u2013 whether that is hydrogen, carbon capture; oil and gas production, wind - offshore and onshore. It\u2019s going to look a lot more diverse, which is really good for the region.\" Doesn\u2019t she fear a boom-bust effect? \u201cNo. Aberdeen has a strong history of generating its own activity. From granite to fisheries, to oil and gas \u2013 it's a very industrious region and it\u2019s got a lot of talented people who are recognising the change that's taking place \u2013 particularly in the climate conversation.\u201d Aberdeen does indeed enjoy much more economic diversity than the moribund coal fields. But is Charlotte wearing green-tinted spectacles? I checked the view of the rig crews in Spider\u2019s Bar - close to Aberdeen\u2019s North Sea helipad. The patrons don\u2019t want to be named or photographed \u2013 but some are happy to share their views about the future of oil and gas in Aberdeen. I ask one if oil will still be thriving 30 years hence when he plans to retire. \u201cEasy,\u201d he says, \u201ceasy.\u201d Was he worried about the transition away from fossil fuels? \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it. We just turn up and take the money,\u201d he said. A colleague said he expected at least 15 years more oil and gas drilling. \u201cThat\u2019ll see me through (to retirement)\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my third oil slump and I\u2019ve got through OK.\u201d They are an optimistic bunch - but there's no guarantee they'll all find suitable jobs if the oil and gas industry is forced to close sooner than they expect. Meanwhile Pauline Douglas is working to bring life back to the villages near Longannet where Rab and Tom were laid off.  She was born in the area and she's working with colleagues in the Coalfields Regeneration Trust to revive the villages. They have been wooing the Spanish firm Talgo, which is promising to build high-speed trains at Longannet \u2013 if it secures a major order such as HS2. \u201cThere will be new houses, new businesses,\u201d she says. \"And I think most important of all is the children will have hope and aspirations for the future if there\u2019s going to be real jobs in our communities,\" she says. \"They don't really have that hope just now.\u201d  That, of course, is if the factory actually appears. But Pauline says one clear lesson from the coal fields is for the authorities to start looking to replace lost jobs as soon as possible - not waiting for years as they did when the pits were boarded up. The chair of Scotland\u2019s Just Transition Commission is Prof Jim Skea. At the request of the Scottish government, his commission has been touring the country hearing people\u2019s views on the issue. The sober foreword for their interim report notes: \u201cScotland stands at a critical point on its journey to a net-zero economy.  \u201cWhile emissions have fallen by almost 47% since 1990, the next phase of Scotland\u2019s fight against climate change will be harder and will have a much more visible impact on people\u2019s day-today lives.  \u201cThis will bring significant opportunities, but also inevitably challenges which must be managed by the government.  \u201cIt is imperative that we ensure fairness and a just transition for all as we move into this next phase if we are to have any hope of ending our contribution to climate change.\u201d The report will be launched next week. It says urgent action is needed if Scotland is to meet its climate change targets - and that action will have to be fair to the poorest and to people in high-carbon jobs. Poorer people should get help installing low-carbon heating such as heat pumps.  The Scottish government, it says, shouldn't make any policies or plan any infrastructure that will make it harder to cut emissions in the future. And it should press ahead with plans for making buses a priority and for providing better services in rural areas. The report insists that if Scottish farmers have to reduce numbers of cattle and sheep to cut methane emissions. People in the UK must eat less meat overall \u2013 or meat will be imported from areas where emissions are higher. The next phase of the commission\u2019s report will tackle the question of how this great transition can be funded. The full interim report is launched next week. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"A professor who will be the first black person to host a lecture series in 200 years said science \"historically has been racist\" but \"times are changing\". Prof Chris Jackson will deliver a Royal Institution (RI) Christmas lecture this year, which will be shown on BBC Four. The geologist, from Derby, said he feels he is representing the working class, as well as the black community, and wants people to \"be proud\" of him. The RI said that having a black scientist host was \"overdue\". The Christmas science lectures were started by Michael Faraday in 1825, and are now broadcast on television annually. In 2015,  Kevin Fong presented a lecture  but until then they had been hosted by white scientists.  Prof Jackson, who will present alongside Dr Helen Czerski and Dr Tara Shine, told the BBC: \"There have clearly been other qualified black people to give this lecture in the last 200 years. \"I think institutions and people have been very poor at recognising the contributions of black scientists, as they have equally women scientists. \"Times are changing now so there is increasing recognition that there have been significant contributions made by those groups of people.\" Prof Jackson, who works in the faculty of engineering at Imperial College, London, said his lecture will be about how rocks are a \"very rich record\" of how climate has changed over millions of years.  He said it was \"an absolutely huge honour\" to be chosen.  A spokesman from The RI said: \"While we can't change the past, we can learn from it. That's why we are doing as much as we can to bring greater diversity. \"Our Christmas lecturers are always experts in their scientific discipline and always have evidence of their past commitment to public engagement, so it's great when they're also from more diverse backgrounds.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on  Facebook ,   Twitter , or  Instagram .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice Attempts to incorporate a key scientific study into global climate talks in Poland have failed.  The IPCC report on the impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C, had a significant impact when it was launched last October. Scientists and many delegates in Poland were shocked as the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait objected to this meeting \"welcoming\" the report. It was the 2015 climate conference that had commissioned the landmark study. The report said that the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century rather than 1.5C. Keeping to the preferred target would need \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\". If warming was to be kept to 1.5C this century, then emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be reduced by 45% by 2030. The report, launched in Incheon in South Korea, had an immediate impact winning praise from politicians all over the world. But negotiators here ran into serious trouble when Saudi Arabia, the US, Russia and Kuwait objected to the conference \"welcoming\" the document.  Instead they wanted to support a much more lukewarm phrase, that the conference would \"take note\" of the report. Saudi Arabia had fought until the last minute in Korea to limit the conclusions of the document. Eventually they gave in. But it now seems that they have brought their objections to Poland. The dispute dragged on as huddles of negotiators met in corners of the plenary session here, trying to agree a compromise wording. None was forthcoming. With no consensus, under UN rules the passage of text had to be dropped. Many countries expressed frustration and disappointment at the outcome. \"It's not about one word or another, it is us being in a position to welcome a report we commissioned in the first place,\" said Ruenna Haynes from St Kitts and Nevis. \"If there is anything ludicrous about the discussion it's that we can't welcome the report,\" she said to spontaneous applause. Scientists and campaigners were also extremely disappointed by the outcome. \"We are really angry and find it atrocious that some countries dismiss the messages and the consequences that we are facing, by not accepting what is unequivocal and not acting upon it,\" said Yamide Dagnet from the World Resources Institute, and a former climate negotiator for the UK. Others noted that Saudi Arabia and the US had supported the report when it was launched in October. It appears that the Saudis and the US baulked at the political implications of the UN body putting the IPCC report at its heart.  \"Climate science is not a political football,\" said Camilla Born, from climate think tank E3G. \"All the world's governments - Saudi included - agreed the 1.5C report and we deserve the truth. Saudi can't argue with physics, the climate will keep on changing.\" Many delegates are now hoping that ministers, who arrive on Monday, will try and revive efforts to put this key report at the heart of the conference.  \"We hope that the rest of the world will rally and we get a decisive response to the report,\" said Yamide Dagnet.  \"I sincerely hope that all countries will fight that we don't leave COP24 having missed a moment of history.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Next year will continue the global warming trend with temperatures again likely to rise more than one degree above pre-industrial levels.  According to the Met Office, 2020 will likely be 1.11C warmer than the average between 1850-1900,  The year ahead is set to extend the series of the warmest years on record to six in a row. Scientists say the strongest factor causing the rise is greenhouse gas emissions. The world first broke through one degree above pre-industrial temperatures back in 2015.  Each year since then has seen temperatures close to or above this mark.  The warmest year on record is 2016 when a strong El Ni\u00f1o made a significant difference. This weather phenomenon sees sea surface temperatures increase in the central and eastern Pacific and it's associated with a range of impacts around the world, including the overall global level of warming. According to the Met Office, the chances of a strong El Ni\u00f1o in 2020 are low.  They forecast that the global average temperature next year will be in the range of 0.99C to 1.23C with a central estimate of 1.11C. The researchers say that the key factor will be emissions of CO2 and other warming gases.  \"Natural events - such as El Ni\u00f1o-induced warming in the Pacific - influence the climate system, but in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o, this forecast gives a clear picture of the strongest factor causing temperatures to rise - greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Professor Adam Scaife, the Met Office head of long-range prediction. According to researchers, carbon dioxide emissions this year have risen slightly, despite a drop in the use of coal. The Global Carbon Project's  annual analysis of emission trends  suggests that CO2 will go up by 0.6% in 2019. The rise is due to continuing strong growth in the utilisation of oil and gas. The scale of emissions has a direct bearing on temperatures, scientists say. Provisional figures released earlier this month by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggest 2019 is on course to be the second or third warmest year ever. If those numbers hold, 2015-2019 would end up being the warmest five-year period on record. The Met Office say they have confidence in their prediction for 2020 based on what's happened in previous years.  This time last year they estimated that 2019 would be 1.10C above the 1850-1900 mark. The actual temperature recorded this year from January to October shows a global mean 1.11C. The BBC Briefing is a series of downloadable online guides to the big topics in the news.

The recent COP25 summit in Madrid saw several key issues kicked down the road to Glasgow where countries from all over the world will meet next November.  The critical issue of increasing ambition to curb emissions is set to dominate the discussions, which will be presided over by the UK.  The Committee on Climate Change  has warned the government  that Britain needed to do better to meet its own targets if it wanted to have credibility with negotiators in Glasgow.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Human societies will soon start to experience adverse effects from manmade climate change, a prominent economist has warned. Prof Richard Tol predicts the downsides of warming will outweigh the advantages with a global warming of 1.1C - which has nearly been reached already. Prof Tol is regarded by many campaigners as a climate \"sceptic\". He has previously highlighted the positive effects of CO2 in fertilising crops and forests.  His work is widely cited by climate contrarians. \"Most people would argue that slight warming is probably beneficial for human welfare on net, if you measure it in dollars, but more pronounced warming is probably a net negative,\" Prof Tol told the  BBC Radio 4 series Changing Climate . Asked whether societies were at the point where the benefits start to be outweighed by consequences, he replied: \"Yes. In academic circles, this is actually an uncontroversial finding.\" But it is controversial for climate contrarians, who often cite Professor Tol's work to suggest that we shouldn't worry about warming. Matt Ridley, the influential Conservative science writer, said he believed the world would probably benefit from a temperature rise of up to 2C. \"I think we probably will see 1.5 degrees of warming. The point is most people think 2C is when it turns catastrophic. That's not right. The literature is very clear; 2C is when we start to get harm. Up until then we get benefit,\" he said.  \"We've got a greening in all ecosystems as a result of CO2. We've got about 11% more green vegetation on the planet than 30 years ago, much of which is down to the CO2 fertilisation effect.\" On fertilisation Matt Ridley refers to unpublished work by Professor Ranga Myneni from Boston University.  But he told BBC News Lord Ridley had accurately quoted his research on the impacts of current CO2 levels, but was unduly complacent about future warming.  \"I am worried about how this work is being interpreted, by Lord Ridley. In my opinion, [CO2 fertilisation] benefit of greening is not worth the price of all the negative changes,\" he said. Richard Tol from Sussex University believes discussion over the impacts of a 2C temperature rise is largely irrelevant as the world is likely to warm by between 3-5C, because politicians at the forthcoming Paris climate summit won't be willing or able to make the scale of cuts needed to keep temperature rises under 2C. He says a rise of 4C would be undesirable but manageable for Europe and all nations rich enough to cope with the costs of adaptation. The best way of combating climate change, he told BBC News, was to maximise economic growth. Tim Lenton, professor of Earth systems science from Exeter University, told us this was a highly optimistic prognosis under a 4C rise. \"The land surface of central Europe would be quite a lot more than 4C warmer on average, changing potentially the pattern of seasonality over Europe.  \"We would have lost the summer Arctic sea-ice, [and] would have sea-ice cover radically thinned in winters.  \"We're seeing already that appears to have some connection to changes in the pattern of weather and weather extremes and the changes in the distribution of rivers and river flows. \"We might then speculate about how intense Mediterranean drying might drive... movements of people. It would be a very different Europe.\" Johan Rockstrom, director of the Resilience Centre at Stockholm University, warns that the further we go above 2C, the more we risk triggering irreversible effects. \"What takes us to 6C is not carbon emissions, it is biosphere response. Will we be able to maintain the natural carbon sinks in the permafrost, in the rainforests, in the boreal forests, in the wetlands and in the coastal regions? Because that's where the big stores are.  \"We emit nine gigatons of carbon per year from our burning of fossil fuels, but there's a 100 gigatons lying just under the Siberia tundra. You have many-fold larger stores of carbon in the topsoil of tropical soils, or under the ice in the Arctic.  \"If we don't manage the living ecosystems well enough they could start biting us from behind.\" Changing Climate is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday, 16 November Follow Roger  on Twitter .

The impacts of global warming are likely to be \"severe, pervasive and irreversible\", a major report by the UN has warned. Scientists and officials meeting in Japan say the document is the most comprehensive assessment to date of the impacts of climate change on the world. Here is a selection of BBC archive video reports to illustrate what scientists say could be some of the biggest effects of climate change. For a more detailed overview of science behind these changes, read the  Q&A on climate change . Human-induced warming is likely to lead to large-scale and potentially irreversible changes in physical systems such as the cryosphere (regions covered by snow or ice).  Melting ice will contribute to sea level rise, with consequences for coastal communities, ecosystems and cities.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Winter activities on ice are becoming increasingly dangerous as the world warms, scientists say. When researchers  looked at data on drowning accidents in largely frozen lakes or rivers , they saw a \"strong correlation\" to rising temperatures.  They found that deaths from drowning were five times higher when warmer weather made the ice thinner and weaker. Children aged under nine years and younger adults were most at risk. For indigenous peoples in many northern regions of the world, livelihoods often depend on access to frozen lakes in winter for hunting, fishing and travel. In countries like the US, Canada and Russia, winter leisure activities such as skating or tobogganing on ice are also hugely popular. But as the world warms, winter ice is becoming less stable and scientists believe it poses a greater threat of accidental drowning.  Canadian researchers looked at data on 4,000 drowning events in 10 countries over three decades since the 1990s.  They found that higher temperatures were a good predictor of the number of deaths by drowning. \"We can confidently say that there is a quite a strong correlation between warmer winter air temperatures and more winter drownings,\" said study leader Sapna Sharma, from York University in Toronto, Canada. \"Almost half of the winter drownings were associated with warmer temperatures.\" The researchers collated data from official sources including coroner's offices. They were able to compare these figures to longstanding records from lakes showing when ice formed and melted each winter.  Canada and the US had the highest number of drownings related to ice, an issue that was particularly acute among indigenous communities further north.  The use of snowmobiles on lakes was associated with many of the lake fatalities. One of the saddest aspects of the study was the fact that many of the victims were very young. \"We found that almost half of those drowned in Minnesota where there was no vehicle involved were children under nine years old,\" said Sapna Sharma. \"They were playing on the ice, tobogganing or ice skating and they just weren't able to recognise when the ice was unsafe. They may not have recognised that slushy ice or a little open patch of water could be so fatal.\" Even where lake or river accidents weren't deadly, they often had life-changing results.  In cold water accidents where children suffered cardiac arrest, some 90% also experienced significant neurological damage - and only 27% were alive a year later.  However, some countries have managed to limit the number of drownings during winter, including Germany and Italy. Local laws prohibit the use of snowmobiles on lakes and activities like skating are often limited until local authorities deem the ice to be safe.  Education is also seen to be a key element. According to Barbara Byers from the Canadian  Lifesaving Society , people just don't recognise the personal threat that a changing climate can pose. \"People think that ice is ice but appearances can be deceiving,\" she told BBC News. \"People may think it's cold out, the ice must be fine but it really is the quality of the ice or the type of ice that's really important. \"Ice now gets frozen and thawed and when that happens there's water in-between the layers of the ice. So it may look hard and frozen, but it's not.\" Researchers say that despite efforts to educate, they expect that drowning events will likely increase in the future. They are particularly worried about this winter, as people may be spending more time outdoors due to the pandemic, with potentially fatal results. \"Everything's closed right now, and more people are spending time in nature and where they might not have done so before,\" said Sapna Sharma.  \"This year, it's forecast to be a warmer, wetter winter in Canada, so in combination with more people going outside that could be that could be quite dangerous.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Plos One.

{"id":null,"body":"Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent @BBCJustinR on Twitter A surprise announcement at this year's UN General Assembly has transformed the politics of cutting carbon, says the BBC's chief environment correspondent, Justin Rowlatt. As the meeting of the so-called \"global parliament\" comes to an end, he asks whether it might just signal the beginning of a global rush to decarbonise. You probably missed the most important announcement on tackling climate change in years.  It was made at the UN General Assembly. It wasn't the big commitment to protect biodiversity or anything to do with the discussion about how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic - vitally important though these issues are. No, the key moment came on Tuesday last week when the Chinese President, Xi Jinping,  announced that China would cut emissions to net zero by 2060. The commitment is a huge deal on its own, but I believe his promise marks something even more significant: China may have fired the starting gun on what will become a global race to eliminate fossil fuels. I'll get to that later. First off, Xi's pledge. It is fair to say environmentalists were stunned by Xi's surprise pledge.  Let's be clear what it means:  China, the most polluting nation on earth - responsible for around 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - is saying it is going cut that back to virtually zero within 40 years. \"Enormously important\" is how Todd Stern - the man President Obama put in charge of climate negotiations - described it to me. \"A massive move\" and \"a happy, happy surprise\" was Li Yan's take: she's the head of Greenpeace in China. The commitment is so significant because China has never promised anything near as bold as this on climate before. And it comes after the European Union committed billions of euros towards a green stimulus package and - only last week - toughened up its own 2030 climate targets. It therefore raises the prospect of a carbon-cutting coalition of Europe and China covering more than a third of world emissions.  Climatologists just aren't used to such good news. International negotiations to reduce carbon emissions all too often end in ugly squabbles. With good reason, says Todd Stern, who was instrumental in making the most successful climate agreement to date: the Paris Agreement of 2015.  The problem is cutting carbon has always been regarded as an expensive chore. The effort to control climate change impacts virtually every element of a country's economy, says Mr Stern, \"so countries have traditionally been nervous about what they're going to be asked to do.\" Indeed, Paris was the first time the world actually agreed that all nations needed to do their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And then, of course, the deal was promptly dumped by US President Donald Trump after he was elected the following year. But even before the US said it wanted out, nobody involved in the negotiations thought the goals laid down in Paris were anywhere near strong enough to meet the objective of keeping the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels. The idea was that every five years countries would be asked to come up with more ambitious targets, ramping up their efforts. The conference at which those new targets were to be discussed was to be held in Glasgow this November.  Thanks to the pandemic it will now be held in November next year. Many observers had expected China to keep its powder dry and produce any ambitious new targets with a flourish at a crucial moment in those negotiations. President Xi definitely had an eye on global politics. His address was a very deliberate contrast to that of President Trump a couple of days earlier. Where Trump blames China for the world's problems, Xi calls for global cooperation and highlights all the good work China has been doing.  He called on the world to work together, investing in a green recovery to lift the global economy from the post-Covid doldrums. \"We are living in an interconnected global village with a common stake,\" says Xi. \"All countries are closely connected and we share a common future. No country can gain from others' difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others' troubles.\" \"we should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future in which everyone is bound together,\" he continues. Heart-stirring stuff, eh? It is also presumably no coincidence that Xi's announcement came weeks before the US Presidential election, and just as the terrible fires on the west coast and a series of fierce storms in the east made climate an issue in the polls for the first time. And a cynic might think his reassuring words were partly a ploy to reingratiate China with the climate-conscious Europeans, and isolate a climate-sceptic US President. It came straight after a virtual bilateral summit between Beijing and Brussels. But there is a much more important broader context for his announcement: the fact that the collapsing cost of clean energy is completely changing the calculus of decarbonisation. Renewables are already often cheaper than fossil fuel power in many parts of the world and, if China and the EU really ramp up their investments in wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, prices are likely to fall even further. Why?  Because the cost of renewables follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. It's like pushing on an open door - the more you build the cheaper it gets, the cheaper it gets the more you build. The Europeans have been quite open that their strategy is to entice other countries to join them by driving down the cost of renewables globally. Alongside this carrot, they also plan to wield a stick - a tax on the imports of countries that emit too much carbon. Meanwhile, President Xi's 2060 pledge was notably unconditional - China will move ahead whether or not other countries chose to follow. This is a complete turnaround from past negotiations, when everyone's fear was that they might end up incurring the cost of decarbonising their own economy, while others did nothing but still enjoyed the climate change fruits of their labour. How things have changed. Very soon, renewable power is likely to be the cheapest and therefore almost certainly the most profitable choice in large parts of the world. Think what this means:  investors won't need to be bullied by green activists into doing the right thing, they will just follow the money. Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20-30-year life? Why carry carbon risk in their portfolios at all? The change of appetite on financial markets has become ever more obvious over the last decade. This year alone, Tesla's rocketing share price has made it the world's most valuable car company. Meanwhile, the share price of Exxon - once the world's most valuable company of any kind - fell so far that it just got booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major US corporations. And this is where the idea of a race comes in. Countries - and companies - may soon rush to decarbonise as they see opportunities to make profits in what will be an enormous new market. President Xi is well aware of his country's leading position in the market for clean energy - investing in renewables has been a priority for China for many years. It is already the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels and wind, it makes more electric cars and buses than anyone else and has also become the international hub for battery production.  \"It is going to keep on driving down the prices, so that everybody can get onto this parade, as it were, and go along,\" says Rachel Kyte, Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, and a former adviser to the UN Secretary General on sustainable energy.  So, it looks like Xi has judged that the economics of clean energy mean that decarbonising is now the most sensible choice for the Chinese economy as well as for the world's climate. He is not alone. Look at how oil companies like BP and Shell are saying they want to move away from the black stuff and into clean energy. Sadly we cannot.  The idea of a global race to decarbonise is a thrilling new prospect for anyone interested in limiting climate change, but I am sorry to say there are still many hurdles along the way. First off, Mr Xi's did not give any details of how his country would achieve his carbon-neutral target. Remember, China is by far the biggest consumer of coal in the world, hoovering up about half of the global supply.  It is also the world's second biggest user of oil - after the US. Across its economy, some 85% of its power comes from fossil fuels with 15% from low carbon sources.  Those ratios will need to be turned on their head to have any chance of meeting the net zero pledge.  That will take eye-popping investment in wind, solar and nuclear power. But all Xi said at the UN about how it would get to its 2060 goal was that China would peak its emissions of greenhouse gases \"before 2030\" - little change from China's previous promise that the peak would come \"around\" 2030.  Li Yan of Greenpeace says the acid test will be whether a raft of new coal plants proposed by provincial authorities are approved. \"Existing core industries are still fighting their survival in China,\" she says, \"and that's why we're still seeing coal plants proposed everywhere.\" We'll see whether they get the go-head - and how aggressive the investment in clean energy is - in a few months when the details of China's next five-year plan are published. So even as the economics tilts in favour of renewables the task of decarbonisation is still enormous. Meanwhile, the effects of climate change will only accelerate. But there is another reason for optimism. The US is the world's biggest economy and the second biggest producer of greenhouse gases, and is therefore essential to any effort to tackle climate change. Under Donald Trump it has steered clear of carbon-cutting commitments. But his challenger, Joe Biden, has said he will re-join the Paris accord, and has promised a $2 trillion green recovery plan for the US, which would aim to slash emissions and tackle the effects of climate change. That holds out the promise of the world's three largest economies, responsible for nearly half of all emissions, all making a serious effort to cut carbon. Once half the world is on-board with the project it is hard to see how the rest could hold out. So - and this isn't something we often say about climate change - there are powerful new reasons for optimism. Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Concentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017.  In their  annual greenhouse gas bulletin , the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend. Carbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years. Researchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11. Concentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees.  Since 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%. 2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution.  The increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade.  The scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time. \"The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. That's because of the impact of El Ni\u00f1o, the  naturally occurring weather phenomenon  which peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere. Not so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction. \"I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia. \"CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!\" There have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation.  Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming.  Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production.  Instead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches.  Earlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agency  traced CFC-11 production  to a number of factories across China.  Scientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come.  \"It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg,\" said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol.  \"If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades.\"  The news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.  Levels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.  Nitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.  Essentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.  The report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.  \"CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova. \"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.  \"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.\" The scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050.  The WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the  COP24 meeting  in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases.  \"The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,\" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. \"The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are.\"  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

Researchers compared the current high temperatures with historical records from seven weather stations, in different parts of Europe. Their preliminary report found that the \"signal of climate change is unambiguous,\" in this summer's heat. They also say the scale of the heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented. The scale and breadth of the current heat being experienced across Europe has prompted many questions about the influence of global warming on extreme events.  To try and see if there is a connection, researchers looked at data from seven weather stations, in Finland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.  They chose these locations because they all had digitised records dating back to the early 1900s, unlike the UK. The team also used computer models to assess the scale of human-influenced climate change. The researchers found that in the weather stations in the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark, climate change has generally increased the odds of the current heatwave by more than two-fold.  This video can not be played There are several different definitions of what exactly makes a heatwave but the researchers in this study have gone with the hottest consecutive three-day period in a year. This has allowed them to  compare the data from the seven different locations over the past 100 years or so. \"In many parts of Europe three day heat is not very exceptional and you could argue that it would be better to look at longer,\" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, one of the study's authors. \"But we've looked at longer periods and it doesn't change the result very much.\"  The researchers also say the warmest three days in succession this year may not yet have happened but they believe that even if next week is warmer, it won't change the overall impact. Scientists are loath to say a specific event was \"caused\" by climate change - however they believe that this new study joins a growing list of solid links between rising temperatures and extreme events. One thing the researchers can't say right now is whether the high pressure system that has been blocked over Europe for almost two months was caused by climate change. The scientists, from the  World Weather Attribution  group say they will address this question when they formally publish their findings in a scientific journal later this year.  They can't be that definite. However the study does give figures for what are termed \"return periods\" or the chances of something happening again.  They estimate that in southern Scandinavia it's likely there will be a similar heatwave every 10 years, while further south, in the Netherlands, it's likely to be once every five years. This ties in with projections from several scientists that the type of heatwave we've had this summer could occur every second year by the 2040s. \"The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable - the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford. \"What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace - in some cases, it already has,\" she added.  While acknowledging that the current heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented in the historical record, the researchers were not able to clearly resolve the impact of human influence.  That's because summer temperatures there vary a good deal from year to year so the trend was impossible to estimate from the observations, the authors said. Despite their reservations about the Arctic they argue that their initial findings should prompt more action on cutting carbon from governments.  \"We are not taking the right measures,\" said Dr Robert Vautard, from the CNRS in France. \"We are discovering climate change rather than doing something against it.\" It involves some serious number crunching!  This new research is called an attribution study - the researchers work out how often these type of extreme heat events have happened at each of the weather stations they looked at.  They compare those findings to modelled results of the climate without the influence of human emissions of carbon dioxide. This way they can work out how much climate change has tipped the odds of a rare event happening.  The list continues to grow.  The major European heatwave of 2003 was among the first events to be linked though it took scientists several years to do it - eventually they concluded that human induced climate change had made the event 500% more likely!  These days the attributions studies are much faster - just last year scientists concluded that the flooding in Houston, Texas was made 38% more likely by climate change while the so-called \"Lucifer\" heatwave in Eastern Europe was made 10 times more likely.  This new study was completed in less than a week.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Incheon, South Korea It is likely to be the most critical and controversial report on climate change in recent years. Leading scientists are meeting in South Korea this week to see if global temperatures can be kept from rising by more than 1.5C this century. The world has already passed one degree of warming as carbon emissions have ballooned since the 1850s. Many low-lying countries say they may disappear under the sea if the 1.5C limit is breached. After a week of deliberations in the city of Incheon, the researchers' new report is likely to say that keeping below this limit will require urgent and dramatic action from governments and individuals alike. One scientist told BBC News that our lives would never be the same if the world changed course to stay under 1.5C.  \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The new study is being produced by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), a body set up to provide a clear scientific view for governments on the causes, impacts and solutions to rising temperatures.  When the Paris climate agreement was signed in December 2015, there was delight and surprise among many delegates that countries had agreed that the long-term goal of the pact should be to keep global temperatures \"well below two degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C\". To examine the challenges and impacts of keeping temperatures below the 1.5C limit, the UN asked the IPCC to produce a special report, which the scientific body has delivered in record time. This week in Incheon, the scientists and government delegates will go through the final, short, 15-page Summary for Policymakers, the key distillation of the underlying scientific reports.  This will be done word by word, to ensure everyone - scientists and governments alike - are in agreement on the text. The report will be the guiding light for governments as they decide how to develop their economies in the face of rising temperatures over the coming decades. \"The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously,\" Dr Heleen de Coninck, one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the report, told BBC News.  \"But our lives, when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth, will also look differently.\" \"Lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with.\"  Right now, the world has passed one degree of warming above the global temperatures that pertained around 1850, before widespread industrialisation.   Leaked drafts of the new report suggest that global warming is on track to break the 1.5C mark by around 2040.  This is potentially very bad news for low-lying island states and some of the least developed countries in the world who fear that 1.5C will cause sea-level to rise and threaten their survival.  \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         Slowly and quite carefully. The  IPCC has been in existence for 30 years  and produces detailed assessments of the state of the climate every six or seven years. This special report has been almost three years in the making.  The authors are all scientists who have been nominated by governments and international institutions. In this case, there are 86 lead authors from 39 countries, of which 39% are female.  These researchers, who are unpaid, have reviewed the available scientific literature on the feasibility, impacts and costs of staying under 1.5C.  They have then put together draft versions of their report, after having reviewed some 6,000 references all told.  These draft reports were sent out to other experts and governments for review. In total, this report has had over 40,000 review comments.  Because so many people are involved, and all these review comments have been taken on board, the IPCC has a reputation for being rather conservative, producing reports that have a very broad consensus.   Those involved say the wide range of literature and the large number of authors involved is a key strength of the body. \"We don't base our reports on a single article that has an extreme conclusion, that contrasts with the available literature,\" said Dr Carolina Vera, a member of the IPCC bureau. \"The collective view of the available literature is the most robust contribution that we can provide to the governments.\"  If you add up all the promises to cut carbon made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, it would see the world warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.  For some scientists, there is not enough time left to take the actions that would keep the world within the desired limit. \"If you really look seriously at the feasibility, it looks like it will be very hard to reach the 1.5C,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London and a former IPCC member. \"I am relatively sceptical that we can meet 1.5C, even with an overshoot. Scientists can dream up that is feasible, but it's a pipedream.\" As well as the science, there is also the politics.  For some countries, especially those who are major exporters of fossil fuels, limiting carbon emissions more rapidly than at present is a challenge.  \"The overall big question in this report is how we can still get to that 1.5C goal? What does it take?\", said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace.  \"There are those for whom 1.5C is a matter of life or death and they want the message to be clear. Others might want to suggest that there is not scientific certainty and the messages, for example on rapid fossil-fuel phase-out, should not be so straightforward.\" The challenge of keeping temperatures below 1.5 is considerable. But, if it is accepted by the governments, the report is likely to say that it can be done, if the world is willing to take some very tough steps.  These are likely to involve an intensification of cuts to CO2 emissions, a rapid move to renewable energy and quite possibly, the deployment of technologies to suck greenhouse gases from the air.  This last option is seen as highly controversial. The report is also likely state that lifestyle and dietary choices can make a significant difference - but there are no simple or cheap solutions. \"There is no easy answer; it is a much more complicated answer,\" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs one of the IPCC working groups. \"It has physical elements, it has social elements, it has political elements. The report, as it is scoped, allows us to go into these issues, but a crisp answer I don't think is what we were asked for by governments.\"  There has been quite a bit of speculation that the scientists are being forced to soften the contents of the report, or \"pull their punches\", on some of the major conclusions.  What's happened is that there have been notable changes between different draft versions of the short Summary for Policymakers, which will be released officially on Monday 8 October.  This has led some critics to conclude that important aspects are being downplayed to suit the interests of countries with major fossil fuel industries, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia.  But members of the IPCC say that they will not allow their conclusions to be watered down during the next few days when the Summary is gone through, line by line.  \"What is really important for the work of the IPCC is the respect for the integrity and scientific rigour of the authors - that is at the heart of the work of the author teams,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, a co-chair of the body.  \"If one can imagine the governments holding the hands of the scientists, this means you don't know how science works!\" Quite likely, yes! IPCC sessions are closed from the public, to allow governments and scientists to speak freely. Governments often seek to make changes to the text - the scientists are there to ensure that if changes are made, they are consistent with the research. \"I've never been to an approval session that didn't go well after hours; it's kind of IPCC working practice now,\" said Prof Skea. \"Absolutely it will be a robust session and we are well geared up for it.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Monaco Climate change is devastating our seas and frozen regions as never before, a major new United Nations report warns. According to a UN panel of scientists,  waters are rising, the ice is melting, and species are moving habitat due to human activities. And the loss of permanently frozen lands threatens to unleash even more carbon, hastening the decline. There is some guarded hope that the worst impacts can be avoided, with deep and immediate cuts to carbon emissions. This is the third in a series of special reports that have been produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) over the past 12 months.  This video can not be played The scientists previously looked at how the world would cope  if temperatures rose by 1.5C by the end of this century . They also reported on how the  lands of the Earth would be affected by climate change.  However, this new study, looking at the impact of rising temperatures on our oceans and frozen regions, is perhaps the most worrying and depressing of the three.  In a nutshell, the waters are getting warmer, the world's ice is melting rapidly, and these have implications for almost every living thing on the planet. \"The blue planet is in serious danger right now, suffering many insults from many different directions and it's our fault,\" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, a co-ordinating lead author of the report. The scientists are \"virtually certain\" that the global ocean has now warmed without pause since 1970. The waters have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades, and the rate at which it has taken up this heat has doubled since 1993. The seas were once rising mainly due to thermal expansion - which refers to the way the volume of water expands when it is heated. The extra energy makes the water molecules move around more, causing them to take up more space. But the IPCC says rising water levels are now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.  Thanks to warming, the loss of mass (which refers to the amount of ice that melts and is lost as liquid water) from the Antarctic ice sheet in the years between 2007 and 2016 tripled compared to the 10 years previously.  Greenland saw a doubling of mass loss over the same period. The report expects this to continue throughout the 21st Century and beyond.  For glaciers in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe and North Asia, the projections are that they will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under a high carbon emissions scenario. This will have huge consequences for millions of people. All this extra water gushing down to the seas is driving up average ocean water levels around the world. That will continue over the decades to come.  This new report says that global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario. This is a rise of 10cm on previous IPCC projections because of the larger ice loss now happening in Antarctica.  \"What surprised me the most is the fact that the highest projected sea level rise has been revised upwards and it is now 1.1 metres,\" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, from the CNRS, France's national science agency. \"This will have widespread consequences for low lying coasts where almost 700 million people live and it is worrying.\" On the east coast of England, most of the city of Hull lies below the level of a typical high tide. The sea here can be both a source of wealth and a threat to life.  So the conclusions of the IPCC report have real meaning. A storm surge on a winter's night six years ago found a weak link in a sea wall and flooded businesses and homes.  New defences were ordered and the construction teams are now at work along the shore. But the barriers cannot protect everyone. Computer simulations, developed by the University of Hull, show that if the level of the ocean is one metre higher than now the centre of the city ought to be fine but neighbouring areas will go under.  This highlights a painful question, faced in low-lying places the world over: which should be saved and which should be abandoned as the waters rise?     The report says clearly that some island states are likely to become uninhabitable beyond 2100.  The scientists also say that relocating people away from threatened communities is worth considering \"if safe alternative localities are available\". One of the key messages is the way that the warming of the oceans and cryosphere (the icy bits on land) is part of a chain of poor outcomes that will affect millions of people well into the future.  Under higher emissions scenarios, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks from sea level rise. The report says that a world with severely increased levels of warm water will in turn give rise to big increases in nasty and dangerous weather events, such as surges from tropical cyclones.  \"Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050,\" the study says, even if future emissions of carbon are cut significantly. \"What we are seeing now is enduring and unprecedented change,\" said Prof Debra Roberts, a co-chair of an IPCC working group II. This video can not be played \"Even if you live in an inland part of the world, the changes in the climate system, drawn in by the very large changes in the ocean and cryosphere are going to impact the way you live your life and the opportunities for sustainable development.\" The ways in which you may be affected are vast - flood damage could increase by two or three orders of magnitude. The acidification of the oceans thanks to increased levels of CO2 is threatening corals, to such an extent that even at 1.5C of warming, some 90% will disappear.  When CO2 is dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid. So, the more carbon dioxide that dissolves in our oceans, the more acidic the water gets. Species of fish will move as ocean temperatures rise. Seafood safety could even be compromised because humans could be exposed to increased levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutants in marine plants and animals. These pollutants are released from the same fossil fuel burning that release the climate warming gas CO2. Even our ability to generate electricity will be impaired as warming melts the glaciers, altering the availability of water for hydropower.  Huge amounts of carbon are stored in the permanently frozen regions of the world such as in Siberia and Northern Canada. These are likely to change dramatically, with around 70% of the near surface permafrost set to thaw if emissions continue to rise.  The big worry is that this could free up \"tens to hundreds of billions of tonnes\" of CO2 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100. This would be a significant limitation on our ability to limit global warming in the centuries to come. That's a key question and much depends on what we do in the near term to limit emissions.  However, there are some warnings in the report that some changes may not be easily undone. Data from Antarctica suggests the onset of \"irreversible ice sheet instability\" which could see sea level rise by several metres within centuries.  \"We give this sea level rise information to 2300, and the reason for that is that there is a lot of change locked in, to the ice sheets and the contribution that will have to sea level rise,\" said Dr Nerilie Abram from the Australian National University in Canberra, who's a contributing lead author on the report. \"So even in a scenario where we can reduce greenhouse gases, there are still future sea level rise that people will have to plan for.\" There may also be significant and irreversible loses of cultural knowledge through the fact that the fish species that indigenous communities rely on may move to escape warming. Definitely. The report makes a strong play of the fact that the future of our oceans is still in our hands.  The formula is well worn at this stage - deep, rapid cuts in carbon emissions in line with the IPCC report last year that required 45% reductions by 2030.  \"If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,\" said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC. Indeed, some of the scientists involved in the report believe that public pressure on politicians is a crucial part of increasing ambition.  \"After the demonstrations of young people last week, I think they are the best chance for us,,\" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso. \"They are dynamic, they are active I am hopeful they will continue their actions and they will make society change.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Five contenders to be named Scotland's Tree of the Year have been announced. The shortlist includes a hawthorn planted by Mary Queen of Scots and a \"photographers' favourite\" stunted oak tree. The tree that wins the public vote - which has now started - will receive a care package worth \u00a31,000. That prize can be spent on works to benefit its health, interpretation signage or community celebration. The finalists were chosen by a panel of judges who considered 50 trees - about double the usual number - nominated by the public. Last year's winner was a lone elm, named in homage to JRR Tolkein's Lord of the Rings. The 2019 finalists are:  This sycamore is situated at Gartmorn Dam near Alloa within a post-industrial landscape.  This tree flourishes on top of the eroding remains of the fossil fuel industry, surviving the changing climate around it. Sherriffyards Colliery closed in 1921 and the site is now a country park and nature reserve.  The Climate Change Tree has subsided and re-grown from its exposed rootplate to create an extraordinary tangle which triumphs as the colliery spoil diminishes. Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden, (1685-1747) who was Lord President of the Court of Session, would take his wife Mary to sit on a large stone where they both admired the view of the Moray Firth.  That stone was moved to its present position in 1855 to make way for the Highland railway and it is thought this oak was planted at that time.  The oak is on the path to the famous St Mary's Clootie Well that played an important part in pagan celebration into the 20th Century. Its quirky location guarding the way onto a bridge means the oak is known and loved by many who pass underneath as they enjoy Culloden forest near Inverness. This tenacious tree clings to land at Loch Lomond near the village of Balmaha, in Scotland's first National Park and on the route of the famous West Highland Way.  Its contorted appearance and exposed roots, together with its scenic backdrop have made it a subject for countless photographers. Queen Mary's thorn grows inside St Mary's Quad at the University of St Andrews and is almost certainly the oldest tree in the Fife town.  Mary Queen of Scots is thought to have planted the thorn in the 1560s on one of her regular visits to the town - making the tree not far off 500 years old - an exceptional age for a hawthorn.  Despite its grand old age, the tree still flowers and fruits every year, and is growing well. The Quad is traditionally a busy place, with scholars from all over the world, as well as many tourists passing the thorn daily.  Twenty years ago, one lone rowan clinging to a stream bank in Carrifran Valley, inspired the Borders Forest Trust slogan: \"Where one tree survives, a million trees will grow.\"  In 2020, that lone tree is surrounded by a little forest of its children - a product of some of the first natural regeneration the Trust achieved in the Carrifran Valley.   In addition to its offspring, the rowan tree now has over half a million other native Scottish trees for company.   It is a symbol of a journey to revive the wild heart of Southern Scotland - where it once dominated the view, soon it will be hidden from sight.  The competition is run by Woodland Trust and supported by the People's Postcode Lottery. Carol Evans, Woodland Trust Scotland director, believes the coronavirus lockdown has had an effect on the competition - with twice as many nominations being submitted this year. She said: \"There was a common theme to a lot of the trees and their stories - of tenacity and hanging on against the odds.  \"There were a handful of trees just outside the final six, which had been discovered or were provoking particular affection during people's daily walks.  \"Everyone has taken solace from the nature on their doorstep and it has been quite moving to see so many trees that became places to escape, gyms and classrooms.\" All images are copyrighted.

{"id":null,"body":"A polar bear has killed a man in Norway's Arctic Spitsbergen island, local officials say. The attack occurred at a campsite near Longyearbyen, the main town of the island in the Svalbard archipelago. The bear was then shot and found dead at the local airport. Experts say polar bears' hunting grounds have diminished as the Arctic ice sheet melts because of climate change, forcing them into populated areas as they try to find food. The man, identified as 38-year-old Dutch citizen Johan Jacobus Kootte, was attacked in his tent before dawn on Friday and died shortly afterwards of his injuries. Svalbard officials say there were seven people on the site at the time and they are being looked after by health services. Campsite owner Michelle van Dijk said the man who died had been in his second season as manager; \"He had done the right training and knew how everything worked there,\" she told Dutch public broadcaster NOS.  There had been a warning on Thursday of a polar bear roaming around Longyearbyen, she said. \"He said the situation was under control.\" Terje Carlsen, a spokesman for the governor of Svalbard, told the BBC that the bear was a three-year-old male whose mother had been airlifted with her cub away from Longyearbyen on Monday. Their departure was not linked to the attack as polar bears are considered able to fend for themselves once they get to two years old. Two days later the team from the Norwegian Polar Institute that moved the two bears spotted the three-year-old and ushered it away from Longyearbyen with their helicopter. Jon Aars, who took part in the operation, told the BBC the bear had earlier broken into cabins not far from the city.  After the attack on Friday morning, the three-year-old was shot by one of the people on the campsite at the time. \"This is polar bear country, you have to be alert,\" said Mr Carlsen. Until now only five fatal attacks on humans by bears had been recorded on the islands in the last 50 years. The most recent was in 2011, when  a 17-year-old British student was killed and four others were injured  during an expedition. The archipelago is home to almost 3,000 people and almost 1,000 bears, according to the Norwegian authorities. There has been increased human activity in recent years from tourism and scientific research, resulting in more contact with the animals. Polar bears have been a protected species since 1973, and shooting them is only allowed in self-defence. However, people in Svalbard are advised to carry a weapon outside urban areas. Across the Barents Sea, Russia's Novaya Zemlya islands have reported several incidents involving bears in recent years. In 2019, the main settlement,  Belushya Guba, reported an invasion of as many as 52 bears , and in 2016  five Russian scientists were besieged  for several weeks at a remote weather station on the island of Troynoy.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Climate change is driving the scale and impact of recent wildfires that have raged in California, say scientists. Their  analysis  finds an \"unequivocal and pervasive\" role for global heating in boosting the conditions for fire.  California now has greater exposure to fire risks than before humans started altering the climate, the authors say. Land management issues, touted by President Donald Trump as a key cause, can't by themselves explain the recent infernos. The worst wildfires in 18 years have raged across California since August. They have been responsible for more than 30 deaths and driven thousands of people from their homes.  The cause of the fires have become a political football, with California Governor Gavin Newsom  blaming climate change for the conflagrations . President Trump, on the other hand, has dismissed this argument,  instead pointing to land management practices  as the key driver.  Now, a review of scientific research into the reasons for these fires suggests rising temperatures are playing a major role.  Earlier this year, the same research team  published a review of the origins of Australia's dramatic fires  that raged in the 2019-2020 season. That study showed that climate change was behind an increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather - defined as periods of time with a higher risk of fire due to a combination of high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and high winds. The new review covers more than 100 studies published since 2013, and shows that extreme fires occur when natural variability in the climate is superimposed on increasingly warm and dry background conditions resulting from global warming. \"In terms of the trends we're seeing, in terms of the extent of wildfires, and which have increased eight to ten-fold in the past four decades, that trend is driven by climate change,\" said Dr Matthew Jones from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, who led the review.  This video can not be played \"Climate change ultimately means that those forests, whatever state they're in, are becoming warmer and drier more frequently,\" he told BBC News.  \"And that's what's really driving the kind of scale and impact of the fires that we're seeing today.\" In the 40 years from 1979 to 2019, fire weather conditions have increased by a total of eight days on average across the world.  However, in California the number of autumn days with extreme wildfire conditions has doubled in that period. The authors of the review conclude that \"climate change is bringing hotter, drier weather to the western US and the region is fundamentally more exposed to fire risks than it was before humans began to alter the global climate\". The researchers acknowledge that fire management practices in the US have also contributed to the build-up of fuel.  Normally, fire authorities carry out controlled burnings in some areas to reduce the amount of fuel available when a wildfire strikes - but these have also suffered as a result of rising temperatures.  \"When you do prescribed burns, you can only do it when the conditions aren't too hot and dry, because you need to be able to control the fire,\" said Prof Richard Betts from the UK Met Office and the University of Exeter who was part of the review team. \"But once you've passed the point where you've got hot, dry conditions for much of the year, you've lost your opportunity to do lots of prescribed burnings. So that makes matters worse and makes the land management challenge even greater.\" Another factor in California has been the encroachment of human settlements into forested areas. This has put many more homes at risk of these blazes. This video can not be played Between 1940 and 2010, there was around a 100-fold increase in the number of houses built in dangerous fire zones in the western US. \"It's like building on floodplains as well, you know, people are putting themselves in harm's way, based on past statistics, which are no longer true,\" said Prof Betts.  \"The past is no longer a guide to the future, for flooding and for fire and lots of other ways in which climate change is played out.\" The researchers say that the conditions for wildfire are likely to continue to grow into the future, and according to Dr Jones, the resulting fires will likely get worse.  \"It's pointing towards increases in fire weather that become increasingly intense, widespread and dramatic in the future,\" he said. \"And the more that we can do to limit the degree to which temperatures rise, is fundamental to how frequently we see dangerous fire weather in the future.\" Full details of the review can be found  here .

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played A person has been rescued from a river and dozens of people were evacuated from their homes overnight after Wales was hit by Storm Francis. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said  it pulled a person from the River Wye in Monmouth on Wednesday. Bethesda in Gwynedd saw the highest rainfall in the UK with 104mm (4in),  the Met Office said . Four of the top top five were in Wales. In total, there were 80 evacuations and rescues across north Wales overnight. A whisky distillery in Gwynedd, which had only just reopened after lockdown, saw its cellar flooded. The country saw winds of up to 75mph (120km\/h) and severe flooding on Tuesday and into Wednesday. Natural Resources Wales' Beddgelert monitoring station showed the River Glaslyn was at its highest level ever recorded on Tuesday. A number of rivers burst their banks, requiring evacuation of properties in the Bethesda and Beddgelert areas. Police, mountain rescue teams and North Wales Fire and Rescue co-ordinated the evacuations. In Bethesda about 40 people were rescued from chalets and homes and taken to the local leisure centre. About five Beddgelert householders were also rescued by boat, the fire and rescue service said.  An inspection was due to take place on Wednesday to see if it is safe for them to return. The A5 was closed from Bethesda to Betws y Coed due to flooding and a landslide, and the A498 between Beddgelert and Pen y Gwryd was also closed due to flooding. Motorists are advised to avoid the area \"unless absolutely necessary\". Rail services between Llandudno Junction and Bangor have been cancelled due to flooding. Zip World in Penrhyn Quarry  announced it has suspended all activities  at the site until further notice due to flooding. #StormFrancis   #beddgelert   pic.twitter.com\/5cPXChIhCN North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it received 52 calls about flooding incidents, mostly in the Beddgelert, Abergwyngregyn, Bethesda and Llandygai areas, and carried out 80 evacuations and rescues overnight. Firefighters had to help six people to safety after a property became flooded at Abergwyngregyn, between Llanfairfechan and Bangor, in Gwynedd. Water surged down the River Aber, which burst its banks and flooded two homes and the Aber Falls distillery. \"As far as anyone can remember, the river has never burst its banks here,\" said distillery manager James Wright. \"Our visitor centre is full of mud and the water got into the cellar where some of the whisky is maturing ready for a launch next year. \"It's really hard as we were just starting to emerge from the lockdown, and have been working hard to grow the business. \"We'd started running distillery tours again, and they were fully booked, but we've had to cancel them.\" Mam newydd anfon hwn - wrth y ddistyllfa a\u2019r hen dafarn yng ngwaelod Abergwyngregyn.

It will be another few months before reopening,\" he said. \"I had a family from Yorkshire here with four children, staying in Anglesey, and they stayed here overnight. \"Beddgelert looks awful. There's a lot of mess here. Most of the water was not just from the river but down from the mountain. \"I've been here for 40 years. I had to replace carpets back in the 80s after something similar, but I've never seen something like this and I don't think anyone has seen it this bad.  \"The problem is that the River Colwyn can rise fast and then the Glaslyn, and other lakes behind us. It has rained so much, the river was so high, there was almost nowhere for the water to go.\" Meanwhile, police have resumed  a search for two people  spotted in the River Taff near Cardiff on Tuesday. A number of properties and businesses in Cardiff were also damaged as trees fell down in high winds. Nine campers in Carmarthenshire  had to be rescued on Tuesday and roads were closed across the country after a number of fallen trees blocked roads. Electricity has now been restored to the majority of the thousands of homes affected by power cuts after energy suppliers worked \"right the way through the night\" to restore power supplies across Wales. SP Energy Networks, which supplies homes in North Wales, said about 50 of its customers were still without power on Wednesday morning out of about 10,000. Matt Jones, group manager at South Wales Fire and Rescue, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Wind conditions\u2026 were unusual for this time of year and we've seen several trees being uprooted and blocking roadways.  \"Most of the calls we've been dealing with over the past 24 hours have been involving unsafe structures and trees etc which have been uprooted across roads, so we've been working with local authorities and other partners to get these roads open and made safe as quickly as possible.\" Natural Resources Wales warned that such storms could become more commonplace due to the effects of climate change and said people needed to take individual action in terms of preparing for bad weather. \"We've had two named storms in the space of a week and it hasn't happened before,\" said Jeremy Parr, head of flood and incident risk management.

{"id":null,"body":"Musicians have written exhilarating protest songs about everything from civil rights to apartheid. Yet no-one's managed a popular song about what's meant to be the most important issue of our time. Music writer Alex Marshall asks why. For most of the past year, the United Nations has been desperately trying to get you to listen to some songs. There's one called  Love Song to the Earth  featuring everyone from Paul McCartney to the rapper Sean Paul, and about a dozen more - one sung by Native American schoolchildren, another by middle-aged farmers. There have been SoundCloud uploads and YouTube clips, lyrics translated into multiple languages and tweets begging you to give them a go. But chances are you won't have heard any of them, or even known they've existed, for the simple reason that - how can I put this nicely? - they are almost unanimously awful. \"Say goodbye to lethargy, save the world with this melody,\" goes a  number  by Berlin-based Bernadette La Hengs - lyrics that are pretty typical of this group of songs. \"If we come together, try our very best, the sun can power the world, the wind the rest,\"  says another by Luke Wallace , a Canadian folk artist. Most toe-curling of all is Sean Paul's rap from Love Song to the Earth. \"Mama Earth is in a crazy mess, it's time for us to do our best, from deep sea straight up to Everest,\" he sings. Then he explains exactly why climate change is a problem, in a way that is at least more succinct than most politicians manage: \"Six billion people all want plentiness, some people think this is harmless, but if we continue there'll only be emptiness.\" The hearts of all these people are in the right place - they're singing because they deeply care about climate change and are hoping to motivate people about it before governments meet in Paris later this month to look for a way to limit carbon dioxide emissions. But they're all so off-puttingly earnest, it makes you wonder if anyone's capable of writing a popular song about the issue. There have been huge hits about the environment, of course. Just think of  Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi , a drunken sing-along despite being about paving over paradise to \"put up a parking lot\". Or even  Michael Jackson's Earth Song , which rallies against every environmental injustice going even if it's mainly remembered for the bizarre moment when he starts singing, \"What about elephants?\" But climate change - despite having been a high-profile issue for more than 20 years - hasn't managed to inspire anything similar. Is the topic just too complex? Too scientific and political? Toby Gad should have found it easy. The 47-year-old Dane is one of pop's in-demand songwriters, a man who co-wrote Beyonce's If I Were a Boy. But writing Love Song to the Earth was, it turns out, a challenge. \"It was a complete struggle,\" he says by phone from his Los Angeles studio. \"Since I was about 12, I've cared for the planet and always thought one day I was going to write a song about it, but it's hard not to make it a doomsday scenario you know.\" He had his first try while working with Madonna a year-and-a-half ago, but they started song after song, 10 in total, until she lost interest. \"I didn't quite figure out how to make it not sound preachy,\" he says. \"That's probably why.\" The experience did, though, make him realise he couldn't mention anything scientific in it, or even use the words climate change or global warming as \"half of America would turn it straight off\". He only felt able to tackle it again after realising he had to make the message positive. Love Song to the Earth's chorus repeating \"keep it safe\" is the result. Has it been a success? Well, no, if we're being honest. It's only been played 180,000 times on YouTube since appearing in September, but Gad blames that on the lack of promotion rather than the song itself. Diana Lindley, by contrast, didn't find writing about climate change remotely difficult. The 49-year-old Canadian \"bug farmer\" - she breeds insects to be used as alternatives to pesticides - wrote a song called  Love-a-lution , which began being picked up across the US after the UN pushed it in May. Unfortunately for Diana, it was largely by climate sceptics mocking it for its many spoken-word sections (\"This is a government policy issue - the fate of all people is at stake!\") and a rather hippyish verse in which she sings that \"grandmother turtle is gonna lead the way, guide us to a better day\". They overlooked the fact that the song is actually quite fun. Diana seems shocked by the reaction. \"I'm not a musician. I'm an activist!\" she says. \"I was just writing a song for my friends thinking, 'What would I say to the world's leaders if I could?' Then I heard the UN wanted songs, thought, 'Why not?' and four days later it was up on their website with a photo of [UN secretary general] Ban Ki-moon and the headline, 'Come join the Love-a-lution on climate change!'\" She admits she'd have written the song differently if she had known it was going to be heard outside her living room. \"I didn't want to hit the world over the head with a sledgehammer, but that's how I was feeling at the time. Maybe someone will hear it and go, 'Gee, I can do something better than that.' That'd be great. We really need music to mobilise people.\" It would be wrong to say all climate change songs have failed to strike a chord, as you may have heard a few without realising it. Brandon Flowers of The Killers recently got radio play with  Still Want You , which sneaks the topic into a love song (\"Climate change and debt, I still want you\u2026the Earth is heating up, I still want you\"). While in 1989, The Pixies - a huge influence on Nirvana - wrote  Monkey Gone to Heaven , a song that includes the lines, \"There's a hole in the sky and the ground's not cold and if the ground's not cold, we're all gonna burn\". (The depletion of the ozone layer is here bundled together with climate change.) Strangely, the closest anyone's come close to a true classic about it is British dance act Orbital who in 1996 released  Impact , which tried to get the message across through thumping techno and its subtitle, The Earth is Burning. Paul Hartnoll of the band, which broke up in 2014, laughs when I ask if it actually influenced anyone to care about the issue. \"Er\u2026 I'd like to think so!\" he says. But it was certainly the intention. \"I grew up on punk music and loved the way that would make you think about things. But dance music was always banging on about love and getting on the dance floor, and it just made me think, 'Oh get lost. Talk about something more interesting!'\" He's got a few ideas as to why only a handful of songwriters have tried to tackle the subject. \"I think there's a certain element of laziness and just following the path well-trodden. But writing about it's a bit like a science experiment, isn't it? It's interesting, but it's not romantic and great songs need some romance or maybe some anger.\"  We won't actually get a stream of good climate change songs until it starts \"affecting people when they get up in the morning and people's relatives start dying from it,\" Hartnoll suggests. \"The one good thing is songwriters aren't the ones who are meant to be saving the world are they? I know many try, and valiantly, but it's the politicians who've got to do something. Let's hope they get on with it.\" COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.

{"id":null,"body":"Pope Francis has said climate change is a challenge of \"epochal proportions\" and that the world must convert to clean fuel.  \"Civilisation requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilisation,\" he said. He was speaking to a group of oil company executives at the end of a two-day conference in the Vatican. Firms present included ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Norway's Equinor and Pemex of Mexico.  Modern society with its \"massive movement of information, persons and things requires an immense supply of energy\", he told the gathering. \"But that energy should also be clean, by a reduction in the systematic use of fossil fuels,\" he said.  \"Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty.\"  The world needed to come up with an energy mix that combated pollution, eliminated poverty and promoted social justice, he added. As many as one billion people still lack electricity, he said. Under Pope Francis' leadership, the church has moved to confront the business world on a range of subjects from poverty to tax havens and complex financial securities. 2017 \"You can see the effects of climate change with your own eyes and scientists tell us clearly the way forward. \"All of us have a responsibility. All of us. Some small, some big. A moral responsibility, to accept opinions, or make decisions. I think it is not something to joke about.\" Quoting from the Old Testament, he then said: \"Man is stupid, a stubborn, blind man. \"Those who deny it [climate change] should go to the scientists and ask them. They are very clear, very precise.\" 2015  \"We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her [the Earth] at will. \"The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. \"We need only take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling into serious disrepair. \"I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet.\"  The unprecedented conference brought together oil executives, investors and Vatican experts who, like the Pope, back scientific opinion that climate change is caused by human activity and that global warming must be curbed, Reuters reports. It is being held behind closed doors at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, in a secluded 16th-Century villa in the Vatican gardens.  Called Energy Transition and Care for Our Common Home, it has been organised by the Catholic University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Consumption of oil and gas is expected to grow, according to analysts, remaining the world's largest sources of energy for the foreseeable future. ExxonMobil alone has announced plans to increase oil production in the US and start more than two dozen projects worldwide, adding more than one million oil-equivalent barrels per day. The firm says it has taken steps to reduce emissions in its own operations, spending $9bn on the effort since 2000. But it maintains that growing demand for energy cannot be met by alternatives like wind and solar power alone.  Renewable sources provided about 18% of energy consumed in 2015 , with forms like solar, wind and hydropower representing less than 10%, according to the International Energy Agency. That share is expected to grow to just 15% by 2030, it said. The  US Energy Information Administration expects oil and other liquids to continue to account for almost a third of energy until 2040 .

A supporter of the Brazilian president mocked Mr Macron's wife, Brigitte, 66, in a Facebook post. The post contained a photo contrasting the French first lady's appearance with that of Mr Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, 37. \"Now you understand why Macron is persecuting Bolsonaro?\" it reads. In response to the comment, Mr Bolsonaro wrote (in Portuguese): \"Do not humiliate (him)... man, ha ha.\" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks, Mr Macron said it was \"extraordinarily rude\" and \"sad\". \"He said very disrespectful things about my wife. I have great respect for the Brazilian people and can only hope they soon have a president who is up to the job,\" Mr Macron said at a news conference at the G7 summit in Biarritz on Monday. The exchange highlights the acrimony between Mr Macron and Mr Bolsonaro in a diplomatic spat sparked by the Amazon fires. Mr Macron is spearheading efforts to get world leaders to do something about the fires ravaging parts of the Amazon rainforest.  Mr Macron has described the wildfires as an \"international crisis\", which critics have blamed on Mr Bolsonaro's anti-environmental rhetoric and lack of action on deforestation.  But Mr Bolsonaro, whose country is not in the G7, accused Mr Macron of having a \"colonialist mentality\".

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played World leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, after Theresa May urged them to do more on climate change. The prime minister called on the G20 countries to set targets for net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, 19 pledged to meet their targets set in the 2015 Paris agreement. The US did not sign up. The UK is the first country to legally commit to become a net zero emitter of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At the summit, Mrs May was also one of several world leaders to put pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. Leading the session on climate change, Mrs May called on other world leaders to match the UK's net zero target, aiming for the summit's joint statement to have \"the strongest wording we can deliver\" on the issue. But only 19 of the 20 leaders signed up to the statement, which committed them to the \"irreversibility\" of the 2015 Paris agreement and pledged the full implementation of its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  US President Donald Trump declined to sign. Mrs May said: \"In recent months we have heard hundreds of thousands of young people urge us - their leaders - to act on climate change before it's too late.\" The UK's net zero goal was \"world-leading\", she said as she called on other countries to \"raise their ambition and embrace this target\". The UK's target means it will have to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions completely or - in the most difficult cases - offset them by planting trees or absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Under the Paris agreement, reaffirmed by the 19 world leaders, every nation is committed to keeping global temperature rises to less than 2C (3.6F) higher than pre-industrial times. Scientists say that a 1.5C rise is the threshold for dangerous climate change, and if other countries adopted the UK's net zero target, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below this by 2100. Separately, in a 20-minute meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, she raised the case of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a British official said. US intelligence concluded the crown prince directed the killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last year, but Saudi authorities have denied they were acting on his orders. With 11 unidentified people put on trial behind closed doors, Mrs May told Prince Mohammed that the legal process must be \"open and transparent\", the official said. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it was Saudi Arabia's responsibility to \"uncover\" the perpetrators, but added: \"Nothing is done so far.\" He said they should be prosecuted in Turkey. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said he highlighted \"continuing concerns\" about the investigation, and about human rights in Saudi Arabia. But the US president praised Prince Mohammed as a \"terrific ally\" and said \"nobody so far has directly pointed a finger at the future king of Saudi Arabia\". Mrs May also called for other countries to follow the UK's pledge of \u00a31.4bn to the Global Fund, an international organisation which fights three of the world's deadliest diseases. The UK will contribute \u00a3467m a year for three years, providing tuberculosis treatment for more than two million people, 90 million mosquito nets to protect people from malaria, and treatment for more than three million people living with HIV - the virus that causes Aids. Mrs May said the world needed \"urgent international action and a truly collective response\" to halt the spread of these illnesses. The pledge follows an appeal by Sir Elton John and French President Emmanuel Macron for an \u00a311bn cash injection for the Global Fund, which is expected to help save 16 million lives. Sir Elton, whose Aids foundation works with the fund, said the UK's response set an \"extraordinary example for others to follow\". Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who is one of the Global Fund's backers, said the UK pledge was \"really fantastic\" and urged the country to continue supporting overseas aid. The Microsoft founder told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I wish all the UK citizens could go and see how miraculous it is that HIV - that was going to kill so many people and really undermine these societies and destabilise them - because of the generosity, that's been avoided.\" Earlier in the day, Russian president Vladimir Putin was asked about  Mrs May's comments the day before on the Salisbury poisonings  and her assertion that Russia must end its \"irresponsible and destabilising activity\". The UK believes two officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, in March 2018. Russia denies any involvement. The Russian president said: \"She set out her position in a fairly tough way. That's true, it's how it was. I informed her of the position of the Russian Federation on a series of irritants in our relationship.\" He added: \"However people behave to us, we will behave to them. Tit for tat.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A global group of around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency. The  study , based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis. Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing \"untold human suffering\" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world.  So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a \"suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years\". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. \"An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,\" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. \"That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people.\"  The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor.  Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference.  These are: Energy:  Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables.  Short-lived pollutants:  These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature:  Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food:  A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy:  Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population:  The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research  The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research.  All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online.  \"We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a  a problem,\" said Dr Newsome. The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action.  However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope.  \"We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. \"As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress.\" The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option.  \"It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,\" said Dr Newsome.  \"It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent At UN climate talks in Morocco, countries say they are prepared to move ahead without the US. President-elect Trump has said that he will \"cancel\" the Paris Climate Agreement within 100 days of taking office.  Negotiators in Marrakech say that such a move would seriously damage the credibility of the US. But fossil fuel supporters say Mr Trump's plans prioritise the needs of American families. The election of a candidate viewed with horror by many environmental campaigners, has cast a significant shadow over  COP22  - the annual meeting of climate delegates from almost 200 countries.  They have come to Marrakech to work on the nuts and bolts of the  Paris Climate Agreement .   However the election of Mr Trump now poses something of a threat to the deal signed less than a year ago in the French capital.  The treaty commits governments to take action to keep global temperatures from rising by 2C above pre-industrial levels and to do their best to keep that rise to less than 1.5 degrees.  But Mr Trump has promised that within 100 days of taking office he would \"cancel\" the agreement and \"stop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programmes\". Aware of Mr Trump's intentions, countries speedily ratified the Paris deal and it became a binding part of international law on 4 November. If the new president wants to take the US out of the agreement, the process will require four years before he is free of it.   But while that might frustrate Mr Trump, he has also promised within his first 100 days, to rescind the executive actions that President Obama has taken to limit US emissions of carbon.  The key element of the Obama scheme was the  Clean Power Plan , that aimed to severely restrict CO2 from energy production.  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly denounced the costs of the plan and said he would reverse it. \"It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan, which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2bn a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-power electricity plants,\" he told an audience in New York in September. The President-elect's plans to renege on the Paris Agreement and push forward with coal have been condemned by green groups globally.  \"Trump's election is a disaster, but it cannot be the end of the international climate process,\" said May Boeve from 350.org.  \"We're not giving up the fight and neither should the international community. Trump will try and slam the brakes on climate action, which means we need to throw all of our weight on the accelerator.\" In Marrakech, where up to 20,000 participants from all over the world are trying to advance the Paris Climate Agreement, there was a strong sense that the President-elect's promises wouldn't sabotage the deal. \"I'm sure that the rest of the world will continue to work on it,\" Moroccan chief negotiator Aziz Mekouar told wire agencies. Others felt that the practicalities of office may change Mr Trump's tone. \"Now that the election campaign has passed and the realities of leadership settle in, I expect he will realise that climate change is a threat to his people and to whole countries which share seas with the US, including my own,'' said Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine at the meeting.  However, Mr Trump's promise to rapidly get out of the Paris agreement and to push forward with a coal friendly policy have been welcomed by groups representing the fossil fuel industry.  According to the American Energy Alliance (AEA), which has attracted funding from companies and individuals opposed to green energy, the election presented the opportunity to reset the \"harmful\" policies of the last generation. \"We were among the first organisations to endorse President-elect Trump,\" the AEA said in a statement.  \"We're excited to work with his administration to put forth energy policies that will deliver affordable energy to American families, invigorate the economy, and create more opportunities for future generations.\" For delegates in Marrakech, Mr Trump's promises to pull out of Paris and his general climate scepticism are an unwelcome distraction but not as yet a derailment.  Many believe that over time, the realities of a changing climate would bring even the wealthy businessman into line. \"It's clear Donald Trump is about to be one of the most powerful people in the world,\" said Alden Meyer, from the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"But even he does not have the power to amend and change the laws of physics, to stop the impacts of climate change, to stop the rising sea levels.\" Follow Matt on  Twitter  and on  Facebook Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Lucy Rodgers BBC News Concrete is the most widely used man-made material in existence. It is second only to water as the most-consumed resource on the planet. But, while cement - the key ingredient in concrete - has shaped much of our built environment, it also has a massive carbon footprint. Cement is the source of  about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions,  according to think tank Chatham House. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world - behind China and the US. It contributes more CO2 than aviation fuel (2.5%) and is not far behind the global agriculture business (12%).  Cement industry leaders were  in Poland for the UN's climate change conference  - COP24 - to discuss ways of meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change. To do this, annual emissions from cement will need to fall by at least 16% by 2030. So, how did our love of concrete end up endangering the planet? And what can we do about it? As the key building material of most tower blocks, car parks, bridges and dams, concrete has, for the haters, enabled the construction of some of the world's worst architectural eyesores. In the UK, it helped the massive wave of post-World War Two development - much of it still dividing opinion -  with several of the country's major cities, such as Birmingham, Coventry, Hull and Portsmouth, largely defined by the concrete structures from that building push. But concrete is also the reason some of the world's most impressive buildings exist.  Sydney Opera House, the Lotus Temple in Delhi, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as well as the magnificent Pantheon in Rome - boasting the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world - all owe their form to the material. A mix of sand and gravel, a cement binder and water, concrete is so widely embraced by architects, structural engineers, developers and builders because it is a remarkably good construction material.  \"It's affordable, you can produce it almost anywhere and it has all the right structural qualities that you want to build with for a durable building or for infrastructure,\" explains Felix Preston, deputy research director at the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House. Despite known durability problems with using steel reinforcement, which can crack concrete from the inside, it is still the go-to material across the world.  \"Building without concrete, although it is possible, is challenging,\" says Mr Preston.  It is these unrivalled attributes of concrete that have helped boost global cement production since the 1950s, with Asia and China accounting for the bulk of growth from the 1990s onwards. Production has  increased more than thirtyfold since 1950 and almost fourfold since 1990.  China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the entire 20th Century. But with Chinese consumption now appearing to level off, most future growth in construction is expected to happen in the emerging markets of South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - driven by rapid urbanisation and economic development.  The floor area of the world's buildings is projected to double in the next 40 years, say Chatham House researchers, requiring cement production to increase by a quarter by 2030. While many of us assume concrete is a recent addition to our cities, architects, and builders have actually been using cement-like binders for millennia. The earliest use is believed to have been more than 8,000 years ago, with traders in Syria and Jordan using such binders to create floors, buildings and underground cisterns. Later, the Romans were known to be masters of cement and concrete, building the Pantheon in Rome in 113-125AD, with its 43m-diameter free-standing concrete dome the largest in the world. But the concrete used in our modern-built environment owes much of its make-up to a process patented in the early 19th Century by bricklayer Joseph Aspdin of Leeds. His new technique of roasting limestone and clay in an oven and then grinding it to a powder to make \"artificial stone\" is now known as Portland cement - still the key ingredient in almost all modern concrete. But, despite its ubiquitous presence, concrete's environmental credentials have come under increased scrutiny in the last couple of decades. Not only does the production of Portland cement involve quarrying - causing airborne pollution in the form of dust - it also requires the use of massive kilns, which require large amounts of energy. The actual chemical process of making cement also emits staggeringly high levels of CO2.  The sector has made progress - improvements in the energy-efficiency of new plants and burning waste materials instead of fossil fuels has seen the average CO2 emissions per tonne of output fall by 18% over the last few decades, according to Chatham House.  The newly-established Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), currently representing about 35% of the world's cement production capacity and with a focus on sustainable development,  was at COP24. Chief executive Benjamin Sporton says the fact the organisation now exists \"is a demonstration of the commitment of the industry to sustainability, including taking action on climate change\". The GCCA is due to publish a set of sustainability guidelines, which its membership will have to follow. \"By bringing together global players to provide leadership and focus, as well as delivering a detailed work programme, we can help ensure a sustainable future for cement and concrete, and for the needs of future generations,\" Mr Sporton says. But despite the promise, Chatham House argues that the industry is reaching the limits of what it can do with current measures. If the sector has any hope of meeting its commitments to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, it will need to look at overhauling the cement-making process itself, not only reducing the use of fossil fuels. It is the process of making \"clinker\" - the key constituent of cement - that emits the largest amount of CO2 in cement-making. In 2016,  world cement production generated around 2.2 billion tonnes of CO2  -  equivalent to 8% of the global total.  More than half of that came from the calcination process.  Together with thermal combustion, 90% of the sector's emissions could be attributed to the production of clinker. Because of this, Mr Preston and his colleagues argue the sector urgently needs to pursue a number of CO2 reduction strategies.   Further efforts on energy efficiency, a move away from fossil fuels and pursuing carbon capture and storage will help, but can only do so much.   \"We've got a long way to close the gap,\" Mr Preston says. What the industry really needs to do is plough efforts into producing new types of cement, he argues. In fact, low-carbon cements and \"novel cements\" might do away with the need for clinker altogether. One of those trying to drum up greater support for such alternative cements is Ginger Krieg Dosier, co-founder and CEO of  BioMason -  a start-up in North Carolina that uses trillions of bacteria to grow bio-concrete bricks. The technique, which involves placing sand in moulds and injecting it with microorganisms, initiates a process similar to the one that creates coral. \"I have a long fascination with marine cements and structures,\" explains Ms Krieg Dosier, a trained architect who was surprised to find no real green alternatives to bricks and masonry when she began research at an architectural firm more than 10 years ago.  The discovery led her to create her own solution, which, after years of development, now takes only four days. It happens at room temperature, without the need for fossil fuels or calcination - two of the main sources of the cement industry's CO2 emissions. Ms Krieg Dosier believes green cements and technologies such as hers offer a solution to the sector's emissions issue. \"Traditional Portland-based cement production practices will continue to release CO2 due to its fundamental chemistry,\" she says, adding that rather than turning to carbon capture and storage, we should be investing more in techniques that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. \"Alternative cements and binding technologies go beyond evolutionary CO2 capture to revolutionary methods that fundamentally sequester CO2.\" Alongside such alternative cements, other \"disruptive\" forces are also beginning to drive change. Digitalisation, machine learning and an increasing awareness of sustainability are all having an impact on the cement industry's culture. \"It's partly changing because of how people want to live, but also because of our ability to dream up new and innovative structures and test those with computer models,\" says Mr Preston. \"There's also the ability to build things more cheaply with robots - with automation.\" But changing processes quickly enough to meet the cement industry's obligations will be a challenge. The sector is dominated by a small number of major producers who are reluctant to experiment or change business models. Architects, engineers, contractors and clients are also, rather understandably, cautious about using new building materials. \"This quite slow-moving, difficult-to-change sector is starting to bump against these quite profound disruptions that we're starting to see in the built environment,\" says Mr Preston.  But, with very few low-carbon cements reaching commercialisation, and none being applied at scale in an industry where bigger and taller is often the ambition, it looks likely that sustained government support will be needed. Without governments applying pressure on the industry or providing funding, it may not be possible to get the next generation of low-carbon cements out of the laboratory and into the market within the required timescale. And the timescale is ever-shrinking.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the leading international body on global warming - last month argued the global average temperature rise needed to be kept below 1.5C - not 2C as noted in the Paris Agreement. This means CO2 emissions need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030. Like other young companies, Ms Krieg Dosier describes the difficulties of simultaneously developing and marketing her products and scaling up manufacturing processes to compete within the wider construction industry.  But she thinks there are reasons to be optimistic.   \"I do believe the construction industry is approaching a point where alternative materials will be more widely adopted,\" she says. \"This is in part due to market demand, other innovative technologies and wider concern for climate change.\" The cement industry, too, points to more optimistic assessments of the industry's progress on emissions and suggests that, across its lifetime, concrete could make a net climate benefit when all possible action is taken into account.  This includes re-carbonation (or the re-absorption of CO2 by cement), concrete's contribution to the energy efficiency of buildings, and innovation in the way cement is manufactured - including carbon capture and storage.   The GCCA says such innovation is its key priority in the months and years ahead. Projects are already underway and showing promise, it added.  But Mr Preston says it is imperative that governments and industry now act quickly at a time when global development is expected to rise but CO2 emissions need to fall. \"There's a desperate need for quality, affordable homes,\" he says. \"There's a need for new infrastructure. We can only square this circle if we can dramatically improve the way that we build, so that overall these buildings are constructed with, as close as possible, net zero emissions.\" Design by Lilly Huynh.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent. Monaco It will be the clearest declaration yet on how an overheating world is hammering our oceans and frozen regions.  Scientists have been meeting in Monaco to finalise a report on the seas and the cryosphere.  Released on Wednesday, it will show how the oceans have been a friend, helping us cope with rising temperatures.  But it will warn that warming is turning the seas into a huge potential threat to humanity. Researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were encouraged by Prince Albert II and the Monaco government in 2015 to produce a special report on the oceans and cryosphere - the Earth's surface where water is frozen solid. For the past three years, the scientists have been reviewing hundreds of published papers on how climate change affects the seas, the poles and glaciers.  Their report will track the flow of water from the frozen tops of mountains to the bottom of the seas, and how this is changing in a warmer world.  Over the past few days, they have been trying to agree a short summary of their findings with government representatives that will be published on Wednesday.  It will likely detail the growing threat from rising sea levels that could imperil hundreds of millions of people before the end of this century.  It will also warn of the threat posed by the growing acidification of the seas, the threats to coral and fisheries and the possibility that warming might melt permafrost, releasing huge amounts of the CO2 gas that's the key to rising temperatures.  \"At current emissions rates, we are effectively dumping one million tonnes of CO2 into the oceans every hour,\" said Melissa Wang, a scientist with Greenpeace.  \"Unless we accelerate efforts to curb carbon emissions and take greater steps to protect our oceans, there will be devastating human, environmental and economic consequences.\" The oceans are like the big sister that constantly has to bail out her careless younger sibling. Every year, the ocean waters soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions that arise from human activities.  This video can not be played Since 1970, the oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat that's come about through global warming. If they hadn't taken in that warming, the surface of the planet would have been devastated by excess heating.   All this absorption has come at a price, though. Our seas are now warmer, less salty and more acidic as a result. \"The reality is that we have been quietly reliant on the ocean to do these things, but there comes a point where the ocean changes because of the scale of what we are doing,\" Prof Dan Laffoley, from the International Union to Conserve Nature, told BBC News.   The heating of the world is having a profound impact on all things frozen. So the IPCC report will look at the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as well as from glaciers on mountains around the planet.  It will chart the rise of CO2 that is making the waters more acidic and more difficult for sea life. It will also link the warming to the rise of \"superstorms\".  One of the big changes has been in the impact of warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which has grown substantially in recent decades.  These frozen regions are critically important for global sea levels, which impact flooding around the world.  As  documented  by my colleague David Shukman, this year has been one of record melting on the gigantic frozen island of Greenland.  In one day alone it lost 12.5 billion tonnes of ice. Antarctica has also enormous capacity to raise the waters around the world.  According to studies, the amount of ice lost from the vast frozen region increased six-fold per year between 1979-1990 and 2009-2017. It is likely that much of the report will focus on the growing threat posed by rising sea waters. There is an expectation that some of the existing predictions for sea level will be revised upwards, with the threat posed to small island states and large cities increasing substantially by the middle of this century.   \"By the end of this century, and if current adaptation efforts are not substantially scaled up, we must expect high levels of risk on low coasts such as atoll islands like the Maldives, and some Arctic communities even in a low-emission scenario,\" said Alexandre Magnan, a research fellow at the policy research institute IDDRI in Paris, and a co-author of the IPCC Ocean Report.  \"In a higher-emission scenario, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks.\" The estimations for the centuries beyond 2100 will be even more stark, with suggestions that sea level rise could be 100 times higher than today.  \"What happens with sea level rise is not disconnected with what happens with warming,\" said Jane Lubchenco, former administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-chair of the expert group of a  High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy . \"Because the ocean is warming we are getting more intense storms. Because the ocean is rising the impact of storm surge from those storms has much more potential.\" It will also look at the increase in marine heatwaves - these could increase by a factor of 50 by 2100. This will have big implications for ecosystems and will increase coral bleaching.  \"Extreme sea level events, such as surges from tropical cyclones, that are currently historically rare, for example today's 100-year event, will become common by 2100 under all emissions scenarios,\" said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an IPCC author and a CNRS research scientist at Sorbonne University.  \"This will have major consequences for many low-lying megacities and small islands.\" However, the report will also look at ocean acidification and will show how climate change is changing the balance.  There will also be sections on coral reefs and there will also be a focus on fishing and fish stock, which are likely to suffer dramatic declines.  For people living in the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, a warmer future means that at first they will get too much water from glaciers as they melt. Then there will be too little.  A  report last year  stated that two-thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear by the end of the century without rapid emissions cuts. This could have huge implications for the millions of people living in the region. The IPCC report will also document the threat posed by warming to permafrost. Some 30-99% of the Northern Hemisphere's permanently frozen soils could melt by the end of the century, freeing up billions of tonnes of CO2 which could in turn accelerate warming to a new, ever more dangerous level.  Yes - the report will also show that the oceans could hold some important solutions to the threats posed by climate change.  There is great scope for renewable energy systems based on the oceans, while cutting carbon from shipping would be a major step forward. Planting more mangroves and sea grass could remove huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.  Even the potential to switch diets to get more of our protein from the oceans would likely help cut carbon.  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter At the conclusion of UN climate talks in Madrid, our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the key lessons. COP25 in Madrid only happened because the Chilean government, faced with mounting civil disorder, decided to cancel the meeting in Santiago. Spain stepped in and in three weeks organised a well-resourced and well-run event.  However, the fact that it was being run by one government, while hosted by another, gave rise to severe difficulties.  Delegates were highly critical of the fact that when it came to the key text about ambition, the Chileans presented the lowest common denominator language first, resulting in a huge number of objections from countries eager to see more ambition on carbon cuts.  Experienced COP watchers said they should have started with high ambition and negotiated down to a compromise. Insiders say that agreement was only found because of the influence of Spanish minister Teresa Ribera who played a key role in bringing parties together during the long, last night of negotiations. This was the word that was most widely used to describe COP25.  There was a yawning gap between the demands of those outside the process and the actions of those within. This disconnect was the difference between the urgency underlined by the latest science, the demands for more ambitious climate targets from school strikers around the world, and the torturous, convoluted nature of the talks.  During the talks, young activists staged an unauthorised protest that saw hundreds ejected by security.  \"It's clear that civil society is at a boiling point, they are frustrated with the glacial pace and they are livid with the presence of polluters and their trade associations,\" said Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability, a campaign group that monitors the presence of the oil and gas industry at COP. \"If these talks are ever going to deliver, governments have to take a long serious look at why its failed for 25 years, and start by kicking polluters out.\" This will be the most critical climate encounter in 2020.  The next conference of the parties may be in Glasgow, but the chance of any real success there will be determined, to a large extent by what happens in the EU-China summit taking place in the German city of Leipzig next September.  The hope is that by then the EU will have formalised its zero-carbon long term goal and also updated its 2030 pledge to cut emissions by 55% of 1990 levels.  The EU will likely try and secure agreement from the Chinese to improve their nationally determined contribution (NDC). Back in 2014 the climate pact signed by President Obama and President Xi Jinping became the lynchpin of the Paris Agreement.  The BBC Briefing is a series of downloadable online guides to the big topics in the news. Click here if you want more context and facts about UK energy policy and the road to our net zero goals. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB)  (PDF, 10.4MB) Many observers hope that if the EU and China can do the same, it will be a massive boost for Glasgow.  \"The good news is that the Chinese president is coming to the summit,\" said Li Shuo, a senior policy adviser with Greenpeace China. \"From the Chinese perspective the NDC enhancement decision is one that has to be made at the very top level so the fact the president is going would provide one potential condition for a political level decision.\" At Paris in 2015, countries submitted their first climate plans, which was relatively easy for many of the larger developing countries.  But in 2020, they are supposed to do much more and as Madrid proved, many are fighting this hard.  The actions of the US in pulling out of Paris and adopting an antagonistic attitude to the COP have chimed with the desire among some of the larger emitters to put off difficult decisions.  That was clearly evident in Madrid.  So Australia fought hard to keep old carbon credits in the system because it wants to use them to reduce its own carbon rather than taking actions that might impact consumers.  India became much more vocal about the need for an examination of whether richer countries have done enough in the years running up to 2020.  If countries can't be persuaded to move away from these self-protective positions, Glasgow will suffer the same fate as the ill-fated Copenhagen COP in 2009. The key takeaway from Madrid is that making progress in climate talks requires huge preparation, strong diplomacy and very committed leadership. Because Madrid failed to clarify so many key issues the onus now falls on the UK to resolve many of the most challenging questions.  In Glasgow, the question of loss and damage, of carbon markets, transparency and many other technical issues will need to solved.  Most importantly the countries will have to agree a major boost in their carbon cutting if the world is to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. At a time when the UK will be negotiating trade deals with the EU and with the US, it is going to require enormous diplomatic clout to deal with the climate question as well. \"The diplomacy to build the confidence of the Chinas and the Indias that they can do more and they will be supported, through economic co-operation and that everyone else is moving in that direction, is incredibly important for changing the politics heading into next year,\" said Jennifer Tollman, a climate expert with the E3G think tank. \"The UK can't do it on its own. They will have to outsource this to people they know and trust.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

Activists oppose Federer's sponsorship deal with Credit Suisse over its links to the fossil fuel industry. Some appeared in court this week after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis inside Credit Suisse offices in 2018 to highlight Federer's deal. Federer did not address the deal directly in his statement. The activists - most of them students - appeared in court in Renens, Lausanne, on 7 January to appeal against the fine. Some supporters gathered outside holding banners which read: \"Credit Suisse is destroying the planet. Roger, do you support them?\" Greta Thunberg - the Swedish teenager who has become the public face of worldwide protests against government policies on climate change - joined the criticism against Federer and Credit Suisse when she retweeted a post from activists 350.org Europe.

{"id":null,"body":"By Phoebe Keane BBC News As climate change becomes a focus of the US election, energy companies stand accused of trying to downplay their contribution to global warming. In June, Minnesota's Attorney General sued ExxonMobil, among others, for launching a \"campaign of deception\" which deliberately tried to undermine the science supporting global warming. So what's behind these claims? And what links them to how the tobacco industry tried to dismiss the harms of smoking decades earlier? To understand what's happening today, we need to go back nearly 40 years. Marty Hoffert leaned closer to his computer screen. He couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. It was 1981, and he was working in an area of science considered niche.  \"We were just a group of geeks with some great computers,\" he says now, recalling that moment. But his findings were alarming.  \"I created a model that showed the Earth would be warming very significantly. And the warming would introduce climatic changes that would be unprecedented in human history. That blew my mind.\" Marty Hoffert was one of the first scientists to create a model which predicted the effects of man-made climate change. And he did so while working for Exxon, one of the world's largest oil companies, which would later merge with another, Mobil. At the time Exxon was spending millions of dollars on ground-breaking research. It wanted to lead the charge as scientists grappled with the emerging understanding that the warming planet could cause the climate to change in ways that could make life pretty difficult for humans.  Hoffert shared his predictions with his managers, showing them what might happen if we continued burning fossil fuels in our cars, trucks and planes.  But he noticed a clash between Exxon's own findings, and public statements made by company bosses, such as the then chief executive Lee Raymond, who said that \"currently, the scientific evidence is inconclusive as to whether human activities are having a significant effect on the global climate\".  \"They were saying things that were contradicting their own world-class research groups,\" said Hoffert. Angry, he left Exxon, and went on to become a leading academic in the field.  \"What they did was immoral. They spread doubt about the dangers of climate change when their own researchers were confirming how serious a threat it was.\" So what changed? The record-breaking hot summer of 1988 was key. Big news in America, it gave extra weight to warnings from Nasa scientist Dr Jim Hansen that \"the greenhouse effect has been detected, and is changing our climate now\".  Political leaders took notice. Then UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher acknowledged the great new global threat: \"The environmental challenge which confronts the whole world demands an equivalent response from the whole world.\"   In 1989, Exxon's strategy chief Duane Levine drew up a confidential presentation for the company's board, one of thousands of documents in the company's archive which were later donated to The University of Texas at Austin.  Levine's presentation is an important document, often cited by researchers investigating Exxon's record on climate change science.  \"We're starting to hear the inevitable call for action,\" it said, which risked what it called \"irreversible and costly draconian steps\".  \"More rational responses will require efforts to extend the science and increase emphasis on costs and political realities.\" How they made us doubt everything  investigates how some of the world's most powerful interests made us doubt the connection between smoking and cancer, and how the same tactics were used to make us doubt climate change. Listen to the podcast from BBC Radio 4  here Kert Davies has scoured through Exxon's archive. He used to work as a research director at the environmental pressure group Greenpeace, where he looked into corporate opposition to climate change. This inspired him to set up The Climate Investigations Centre. He explains why this Exxon presentation mattered:  \"They are worried the public will take this on, and enact radical changes in the way we use energy and affect their business, that's the bottom line.\"  He says this fear can also be seen in another document from the archive that sets out the so-called \"Exxon position\", which was to \"emphasise the uncertainty\" regarding climate change.   Researchers argue this was just the start of a decades-long campaign to shape public opinion and to spread doubt about climate change.  In June 2020, the General Attorney of Minnesota Keith Ellison sued ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Koch Industries for misleading the public over climate change. The lawsuit claims that \"previously unknown internal documents confirm that the defendant well understood the devastating effects that their products would cause to the climate\".  It says that despite this knowledge, the industry \"engaged in a public-relations campaign that was not only false, but also highly effective,\" which served to \"deliberately [undermine] the science\" of climate change.  The accusations against Exxon and others - which the company has called \"baseless and without merit\" - build on years of painstaking research by people like Kert Davies and Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University and co-author of Merchants of Doubt.  \"Rather than accept the scientific evidence, they made the decision to fight the facts,\" she said. But this isn't just about Exxon's past actions. In the same year as the Levine presentation, 1989, many energy companies and fossil fuel dependent industries came together to form the Global Climate Coalition, which aggressively lobbied US politicians and media. Then in 1991, the trade body that represents electrical companies in the US, the Edison Electric Institute, created a campaign called the Information Council for the Environment (ICE) which aimed to \"Reposition global warming as theory (not fact)\". Some details of the campaign were leaked to the New York Times.  \"They ran advertising campaigns designed to undermine public support, cherry picking the data to say, 'Well if the world is warming up, why is Kentucky getting colder?' They asked rhetorical questions designed to create confusion, to create doubt,\" argued Naomi Oreskes.  The ICE campaign identified two groups which would be most susceptible to its messaging. The first was \"older, lesser educated males from larger households who are not typically information seekers\". The second group was \"younger, low-income women,\" who could be targeted with bespoke adverts which would liken those who talked about climate change to a hysterical doom-saying cartoon chicken.  The Edison Electric Institute didn't respond to questions about ICE, but told the BBC that its members are \"leading a clean energy transformation, and are united in their commitment to get the energy they provide as clean as they can, as fast as they can\".  But back in the 1990 there were many campaigns like this. \"Unless 'climate change' becomes a non-issue,\" says another, leaked to the New York Times in 1997, \"there may be no moment when we can declare victory\".  To achieve victory, the industry planned to \"identify, recruit and train a team of five independent scientists to participate in media outreach\".  This important tactic assumed the public would be suspicious if oil industry executives dismissed climate change, but might trust the views of seemingly independent scientists.  These would be put forward to take part in debates on TV, potentially confusing a general audience who would see opposing scientists in white coats arguing about complex technical details without knowing who to believe.  The problem was, sometimes these \"white coats\" weren't truly independent. Some climate sceptic researchers were taking money from the oil industry.  Drexel University emeritus professor Bob Brulle studied the funding for the climate change \"counter movement\". He identified 91 institutions which he says either denied or downplayed the risks of climate change, including the Cato Institute and the now-defunct George C Marshall Institute.  He found that between 2003 and 2007, ExxonMobil gave $7.2m (\u00a35.6m) to such bodies, while between 2008 and 2010, the American Petroleum Institute trade body (API) donated just under $4m (\u00a33m).  In its 2007 Corporate Citizenship Report, ExxonMobil said it would stop funding such groups in 2008.  Of course many researchers would argue such money didn't influence their climate contrarian work. It seems some may have been motivated by something else.  Most of the organisations opposing or denying climate change science were right-wing think tanks, who tended to be passionately anti-regulation.  These groups made convenient allies for the oil industry, as they would argue against action on climate change on ideological grounds.  Jerry Taylor spent 23 years with the Cato Institute - one of those right wing think tanks - latterly as vice president. Before he left in 2014, he would regularly appear on TV and radio, insisting that the science of climate change was uncertain and there was no need to act. Now, he realises his arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the science, and he regrets the impact he's had on the debate.  \"For 25 years, climate sceptics like me made it a core matter of ideological identity that if you believe in climate change, then you are by definition a socialist. That is what climate sceptics have done.\" The BBC asked the Cato Institute about its work on climate change, but it did not respond. This ideological divide has had far-reaching consequences. Polls conducted in May 2020 showed that just 22% of Americans who vote Republican believed climate change is man-made, compared with 72% of Democrats. Unfortunately many of the \"expert scientists\" quoted by journalists to try to offer balance in their coverage of climate change were - like Jerry Taylor - making arguments based on their beliefs rather than relevant research. \"Usually these people have some scientific credentials, but they're not actually experts in climate science,\" says Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes.  She began digging into the background of leading climate sceptics, including Fred Seitz, a nuclear physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences. She found he was deeply anti-communist, believing any government intervention in the marketplace \"would put us on the slippery slope to socialism\".   She also discovered that he had been active in the debates around smoking in the 1980s.  \"That was a Eureka moment. We realised this was not a scientific debate. A person with expertise about climate change would in no way be an expert about oncology or public health or cardiovascular disease, or any of the key issues associated with tobacco.  \"The fact that the same people were arguing in both cases was a clue that something fishy was going on. That's what led us to discover this pattern of disinformation that gets systemically used again and again.\" Naomi Oreskes spent years going through the tobacco archive at the University of California at San Francisco. It contains more than 14 million documents that were made available thanks to litigation against US tobacco firms.  A strikingly familiar story emerged. Decades before the energy industry tried to undermine the case for climate change, tobacco companies had used the same techniques to challenge the emerging links between smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s. The story began at Christmas 1953. In New York's luxurious Plaza Hotel, the heads of the tobacco companies met to discuss a new threat to their business model.  Details of the night's anxious conversations were recorded in a document written by public relations guru John Hill from Hill and Knowlton. Widely read mass-market magazines like Readers Digest and Time Life had begun publishing articles about the association between smoking and lung cancer. And researchers like those who had found that lab mice painted with cigarette tar got cancer were attracting increasing attention. As John Hill wrote in the 1953 document, \"salesmen in the industry are frantically alarmed, and the decline in tobacco stocks on the stock exchange market has caused grave concern\".  Hill recommended fighting science with science. \"We do not believe the industry should indulge in any flashy or spectacular ballyhoo. There is no public relations [medicine] known to us at least, which will cure the ills of the industry.\" As a later document by tobacco company Brown and Williamson summarised the approach: \"Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public.\" Naomi Oreskes says this understanding of the power of doubt is vital. \"They realise they can't win this battle by making a false claim that sooner or later would be exposed. But if they can create doubt, that would be sufficient - because if people are confused about the issue, there's a good chance they'll just keep smoking.\" Hill advised setting up the \"Tobacco Industry Research Committee\" to promote \"the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer\". As in the climate change debate decades later, \"Project Whitecoat\" would pit scientist against scientist. According to Oreskes, the project targeted those who were already doing research into other causes of cancer or lung conditions - such as asbestos - which the tobacco industry could fund. \"The purpose of these programmes was not to advance scientific understanding, it was to create enough confusion that the American people would doubt the existing scientific evidence.\" Journalists were one of the tobacco industry's main targets. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee held meetings in its offices in the Empire State Building for major newspaper editors. It even persuaded one of the most famous broadcast journalists of the time, Edward R Murrow, to interview its experts.  The eventual edition of Murrow's celebrated television programme \"See It Now\" - broadcast in 1955 -shows Project Whitecoat in action, with tobacco industry funded scientists set against independent researchers.  But as would happen later with climate change, it was difficult for the audience at home to form an opinion when opposing scientists contradicted each other. Even Murrow ended up on the fence. \"We have no credentials for reaching conclusions on this subject,\" he said.  If doubt was the industry's true product, then it appeared to be a roaring success. For decades, none of the legal challenges launched against the tobacco companies themselves succeeded.  This was partly due to the effectiveness of Project Whitecoat, as an internal memo from tobacco firm RJ Reynolds in May 1979 concludes: \"Due to favourable scientific testimony, no plaintiff has ever collected a penny from any tobacco company in lawsuits claiming that smoking causes lung cancer or cardiovascular illness - even though 117 such cases have been brought since 1954.\"   But pressure on the tobacco companies continued to mount. In 1997, the industry paid $350m (\u00a3272m) to settle a class action brought by flight attendants who had developed lung cancer and other illnesses which they argued were caused by second-hand cigarette smoke from passengers.  This settlement paved the way to a landmark ruling in 2006, when Judge Gladys Kessler found US tobacco companies guilty of fraudulently misrepresenting the health risks associated with smoking.  Judge Kessler detailed how the industry \"marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs\". The tobacco companies may have eventually lost their battle to hide the harms of smoking, but the blueprint drawn up by John Hill and his colleagues proved to be very effective.  \"What he wrote is the same memo we have seen in multiple industries subsequently,\" says David Michaels, professor of public health at George Washington University, and author of The Triumph of Doubt, which details how the pesticides, plastics and sugar industries have also used these tactics. \"We called it 'the tobacco playbook', because the tobacco industry was so successful. \"They made a product that killed millions of people across the world, and the science has been very strong [about that] for many years, but through this campaign to manufacture uncertainty, they were able to delay first, formal recognition of the terrible impact of tobacco, and then delay regulation and defeat litigation for decades, with obviously terrible consequences.\" We asked Hill and Knowlton about its work for the tobacco companies, but it did not respond.  In a statement, ExxonMobil told the BBC that \"allegations about the company's climate research are inaccurate and deliberately misleading\". \"For more than 40 years, we have supported development of climate science in partnership with governments and academic institutions. That work continues today in an open and transparent way. \"Deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to a small number of employees wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached decades ago.\" ExxonMobil added that it recently won the court case brought by the New York Attorney General which had accused the company of fraudulently accounting for the costs of climate change regulation. But academics like David Michaels fear the use of uncertainty in the past to confuse the public and undermine science has contributed to a dangerous erosion of trust in facts and experts across the globe today, far beyond climate science or the dangers of tobacco. He cites public attitudes to modern issues like the safety of 5G, vaccinations - and coronavirus.  \"By cynically manipulating and distorting scientific evidence, the manufacturers of doubt have seeded in much of the public a cynicism about science, making it far more difficult to convince people that science provides useful - in some cases, vitally important - information.  \"There is no question that this distrust of science and scientists is making it more difficult to stem the coronavirus pandemic.\" It seems the legacy of \"the tobacco playbook\" lives on.

{"id":null,"body":"The Kingdom of Denmark has, despite its relatively small size, punched above its weight internationally. Vikings raiding from Denmark and the other Nordic nations changed the course of 9th- and 10th-century European history; in the Middle Ages, the Union of Kalmar united all of Scandinavia under Danish leadership. In more recent times, Denmark has developed a highly-competitive service-based economy with high employment levels and a generous social security system. The Social Democrats led coalition governments for most of the post-war period until the 1980s, consolidating the country's liberal reputation, although concerns at high taxation levels and tension over immigration have put the centre-right in office for several long periods since then.

{"id":null,"body":"A ruling by the Irish Supreme Court on climate change policy could have \"huge ramifications\" across Europe, the group which took the case has said. On Friday the Supreme Court quashed the government's 2017 National Mitigation Plan. Judges ruled that it did not give enough detail on the reduction of greenhouse gases. The case was brought by the environmental group Friends of the Irish Environment. The Irish government welcomed the ruling and said it would \"carefully examine the decision\". Friends of the Irish Environment spokeswoman Clodagh Daly told BBC News NI the verdict was \"crystal clear\" and would have implications across Europe.  She said: \"It shows governments have to do more to protect their citizens from the worst impact of the climate crisis. \"We know that the transition to the low-carbon economy is technologically feasible - there is no legal basis for a lack of political will. \"Governments around the EU have no excuse now.\"  She said she hoped it would put pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive to follow a similar approach. Ms Daly added that while \"climate change knows no borders\" and emissions were counted on an all-island basis, she noted \"how we respond to the climate crisis is separate\".  She said it meant the Republic of Ireland's government could \"no longer make promises it will not fulfil\" and had a legal obligation to protect citizens from the worst impact of climate change. James Orr, the Northern Ireland director of Friends of the Earth, said the decision was a \"wake-up call for politicians to take effective climate action both here and across the world\".  \"Not only do we have a moral duty to stop the climate crisis but we now have a legal duty as well,\" he said. \"The argument for decisive climate action has become a lot stronger as a result of this epic court case.\" Bringing the case, Friends of the Irish Environment argued the Irish government had a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the next couple of years or face the serious impacts of climate change. It contended the increase in greenhouse gas emissions allowed in the 2017 National Mitigation Plan was contrary to the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  These pieces of legislation make it a requirement to have a published plan for transitioning to a low carbon climate resilient and environmentally stable economy by 2050.  The unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court ruled that more specificity was needed about how objectives laid out in the 2015 legislation were going to be met by 2050.  This was decided on the grounds that a reasonable and interested person could make a judgement both as to whether the plan in question was realistic and as to whether they agree with the policy options. It was ruled that this standard for specificity was currently not met. Climate Action Minister and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said in a statement: \"I welcome the judgement of the court and congratulate Friends of the Irish Environment for taking this important case. \"We must use this judgement to raise ambition, empower action and ensure that our shared future delivers a better quality of life for all.\" The statement said the new government was \"now committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050\". The department will now \"carefully examine the decision and consider its implications\".

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Storm Francis has been lashing the UK with \"unseasonably\" strong gusts of nearly 80mph (129kph) and heavy rain. Homes have been flooded, campers rescued, and road and rail travel disrupted amid the severe weather. A major police search  took place north of Cardiff in the River Taff  after reports that two people went into the water and will resume on Wednesday. Warnings are in place for rain and wind across the UK, with more than 80mm of rainfall in the Lake District.  Emergency services have urged the public to take extra care in the stormy conditions across the UK, particularly along the coast. As of 13:00 BST, wind gusts of 78mph had been recorded at the Needles, on the Isle of Wight, and 63mph at Mumbles, on the Gower Peninsula, according to BBC Weather.  Several places in England and Wales have provisionally recorded their highest ever gusts of wind in August - including 68mph at Pembrey Sands, 52mph at Shobdon in Herefordshire, and 49mph at Pershore in Worcestershire. The Met Office said the Environment Agency had so far recorded 86mm of rain in the Lake District and 74mm of rain in Mid Glamorgan. South Wales Police said it was involved in two separate water searches of the River Taff on Tuesday, including reports of a canoeist having capsized and of a person having entered the water near the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. A woman was also rescued at the River Ely in Leckwith following reports of a person in difficulty. Meanwhile, fire crews  rescued nine people and two dogs  from a flooded campsite in St Clears, Carmarthenshire, after river levels rose. And a tractor dragged a motorhome from the mud at Llwyngwair Manor Holiday Park, Pembrokeshire, as waters rushed past. A number of homes in Neath, Whitland, Tonyrefail and Llanelli were hit by flooding, while flash floods submerged roads across the country. This video can not be played One fire crew in Carmarthenshire spent six hours pumping water from a 92-year-old man's home, local councillor Rob James told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. He added: \"This weather in August doesn't reassure us when our area is prone to flooding in winter, so the fact that we're dealing with this now shows that climate change should be taken seriously.\" Heavy downpours have also caused disruption across Northern Ireland, where motorists were urged to seek alternative routes after  the Shimna River burst its banks  in County Down. There were also road closures elsewhere in the UK and some trains were cancelled or delayed due to flooding. Network Rail said  speed restrictions were in place  on several rail routes across the UK.  Avanti West Coast, Northern, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales are currently disrupted due to weather related issues, it said.  On Tuesday, Network Rail acknowledged that it needs to better understand the risks of extreme weather following the train that derailed in Aberdeenshire earlier this month, killing three people. The public company, which manages the UK's railways, has asked world-renowned meteorologist Dame Julia Slingo to lead a task force which will aim to improve the company's forecasting of extreme weather and its impact on rail infrastructure. The company has also tasked Lord Robert Mair, a leading engineer, to spearhead a separate task force which will look at how Network Rail can improve its management of earthworks - for example embankments or when part of the land is excavated to make space for the railway. Meanwhile, the M48 Severn Bridge is closed in both directions between junctions one and two due to strong winds in the area, Highways England said. Three Met Office yellow weather warnings for rain and wind cover most of the UK on Tuesday, with stormy conditions expected to last until 06:00 BST on Wednesday. Rain warnings cover Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, northern England and parts of north Wales until Wednesday morning. Flood alerts, telling people to be prepared, have been issued for parts of the west Midlands and north west of England. Storm Francis comes on the back of Ellen which struck last week and caused power outages. It marks the first time the Met Office has had two named storms in August since it started the process in 2015.  Forecasters said the winds were \"unusual\" for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of 87mph recorded at The Needles in August 1996. Likewise, the wettest August on record in the UK was in 1912 when 167.3mm was recorded across the country as a whole. Between 1 and 22 August, the UK as a whole had seen some 72.7mm of rainfall - around four-fifths of the average rainfall for the month. No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next storm will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on 1 September. Have you been affected by Storm Francis?

{"id":null,"body":"Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud before his father became king in 2015. But now, the 35-year-old crown prince is considered the de facto ruler of the world's leading oil exporter.  He has won plaudits from Western leaders for some of the reforms he has overseen in the conservative Gulf kingdom, including lifting the ban on women driving and seeking to diversify the economy. But he has also been heavily criticised for pursuing a war in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe; starting a diplomatic dispute with Qatar that has divided the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC); and cracking down on dissenting voices. There were even calls for him to be replaced as crown prince after the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the government, was killed by Saudi agents at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. He denied any involvement, but the murder badly damaged his international reputation.  Mohammed bin Salman was born on 31 August 1985, the eldest son of then-Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud's third wife, Fahdah bint Falah bin Sultan.  He worked for several state bodies before being appointed special adviser to his father, who was serving as governor of Riyadh, in 2009. Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power began in 2013, when he was named head of the Crown Prince's Court, with the rank of minister. His father had been appointed crown prince the previous year. In January 2015, King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz died and Salman acceded to the throne, appointing his son as minister of defence.  One of Mohammed bin Salman's first acts in the post was to launch a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 along with other Arab states. They intervened after the Houthi rebel movement, which they saw as an Iranian proxy, seized control of the capital Sanaa and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. The campaign has made limited progress over the past five years. The fighting has also reportedly left more than 110,000 people dead; seen Saudi Arabia and its allies being accused of possible war crimes; and triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine.  Mohammed bin Salman's power increased with his appointment in April 2015 as deputy crown prince, second deputy prime minister and president of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs. Now in charge of the war in Yemen and Saudi Arabia's economy, his importance as a policymaker became clear the following year when  he unveiled an ambitious and wide-ranging plan to bring economic and social change to the kingdom  and end its \"addiction\" to oil.  The plan, called Vision 2030, envisages increasing non-oil revenue to 600bn riyals ($160bn; \u00a3124bn) by 2020 and 1trn riyals by 2030, up from 163.5bn riyals in 2015.  The plan also involved changing the education curriculum, increasing the participation of women in the country's male-dominated workforce, and investing in the entertainment sector to help create jobs for young people. The prince was also seen as having spearheaded  a boycott of fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member Qatar  in 2017 over its alleged support for terrorism and meddling in its neighbours' affairs - charges Qatar denies.  This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman's ascent continued when in June that year King Salman  replaced the crown prince - his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef - with his son .  The new crown prince subsequently sought to consolidate his power, launching a crackdown against perceived opponents. More than 20 influential clerics and intellectuals were detained  as the authorities targeted a group allegedly acting on behalf of \"foreign parties against the security of the kingdom\". This video can not be played When  King Salman announced (despite objections from conservatives) that a bar on women drivers would end in June 2018  in Saudi Arabia - the last country in the world where such a prohibition existed - Mohammed bin Salman was given much of the credit.  This was followed by the crown prince's declaration that  the return of \"moderate Islam\" was key to his plans to modernise the kingdom , and his  launch of a sweeping anti-corruption drive .  Ostensibly aimed at recovering a fortune in ill-gotten gains, many analysts said the purge of powerful princes and business figures removed the final obstacles to Mohammed bin Salman gaining total control of the kingdom.  The mass arrests however unsettled the foreign investors he was counting on to help modernise Saudi Arabia's economy, and new foreign direct investment plunged to a 14-year low in 2017. Women's rights activists were also rounded up shortly before the ban on women driving was lifted.  Several were accused of serious crimes, including \"suspicious contact with foreign parties\" - a sign of the Saudi leadership's intolerance of criticism despite the appearance of social reforms.  Mohammed bin Salman defended the detention of the activists,  saying they had \"misused\" their right to free speech . \"Here we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without civil war, without stopping the country from growing,\" he said. \"So if there is a small price in that area, it's better than paying a big debt to do that move.\" This video can not be played But it was the murder in October 2018 of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi which was to tarnish Mohammed bin Salman's image abroad the most. Khashoggi had fled Saudi Arabia the previous year and written columns critical of the crown prince. UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said Khashoggi was \"brutally slain\"  inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a team of Saudi agents, who dismembered his body and then disposed of it.  She concluded that Khashoggi was \"the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution\" for which the Saudi state was responsible. She also said there was credible evidence that high-level Saudi officials, including Mohammed bin Salman, were individually liable. However, the Saudi government insisted the journalist's death was the result of a \"rogue operation\" and that the crown prince was not involved in any way. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman denied he had ordered the murder , but said he took \"full responsibility... especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government\".  Saudi prosecutors put 11 unnamed individuals on trial over the killing (five were found guilty and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment; three others received jail terms). Ms Callamard called the Saudi trial a \"parody of justice\" and said the crown prince \"remained well protected against any kind of meaningful scrutiny\".

{"id":null,"body":"Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent @BBCJustinR on Twitter Greta Thunberg is angry, and not just about climate change.   \"The haters are as active as ever\", the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist posted on social media on Thursday, \"going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences\".  Anything, she says, rather than talk about the climate crisis. It hasn't stopped her from campaigning. On Friday, she led another of her climate strikes, heading up a huge demonstration in Montreal, demanding international aviation does more to cut its carbon footprint. But she is clearly very annoyed, accusing critics of \"crossing every line to avert the focus\" with, what she calls, lies and conspiracy theories. Of course, the attention isn't surprising. Over the past year, Greta Thunberg has arguably done more to galvanise global action on climate than any other single individual.   And there is no question the unnerving power of her rhetoric comes in part from the fact that she is so young.   A key reason her \"How dare you!\" message hit home so hard in the UN this week was because she seemed so jarringly out of place in the air-conditioned formality of the UN's New York HQ. It is unusual for young people to hold the adult world to account so forcefully and so publicly and some people clearly don't like it. Donald Trump is one. The US president appeared to mock Thunberg this week when he tweeted that she \"seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\".  She brushed off his sarcasm on Swedish television with a laugh, saying she \"knew he was going to say something about me\". Others have been more offensive, claiming she's being manipulated by sinister forces.   The UK newspaper  The Sun has suggested these include \"energy giants and pushy celebrity parents  - including a fame-hungry mum who once appeared on Eurovision\". Or how about this: Thunberg is \"the deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement\", according to one Australian newspaper.   \"I have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru,\"  wrote the columnist Andrew Bolt  in the Herald Sun.  So, is Greta Thunberg the dour, vulnerable child with mental health issues that her critics present her as? She was certainly not dour when I met her in Plymouth Sound aboard the racing yacht on which she was about to sail to America.  She'd just got back from a trip out in the high winds beyond the breakwater and was clearly thrilled by the experience. And, having met her, the idea that she was somehow persuaded by someone to take up the climate issue is fanciful.   This video can not be played She explained she first heard the world's climate was changing when she was eight, and couldn't understand why so little was being done about it. By the time she was 11, she was very unhappy indeed. She stopped eating. She stopped growing, and she stopped speaking to almost everyone.   \"It felt like I was the only one who cared about the climate and the ecological crisis,\" Thunberg told me. \"My parents didn't care about it, my classmates didn't care about it, my relatives didn't care about this. I mean nobody I knew cared about this and I felt like I was the only one.\" She was determined to change that and, starting with her family, she began her campaign to get the world to take action on climate change.   First, she persuaded her parents to stop eating meat and even got her mother, Malena Ernman, a famous opera singer whose career depends on travelling, to agree to stop flying. Next came the climate strikes. One Friday just over a year ago (20 August 2018) Thunberg walked alone on to the steps of the Swedish parliament building holding her now-famous \"Skolstrejk F\u00f6r Klimatet\" - school strike for climate - sign.  The rest is history.  She rapidly became one of the most celebrated - and reviled - people in the world.  She has developed a network of contacts who advise her - including climate scientists and campaigners - but she's the one who calls the shots.   Those close to her confirm that she writes all her speeches.  She told me she planned to use the two-week trip across the Atlantic to figure out what she was going to say at the UN Climate Summit.   \"I will try and communicate the urgency and say that they are the ones in charge now. Show leadership!\" she said. She certainly did that on Monday when she accused world leaders of \"stealing my dreams and my childhood\", and warned them that \"the eyes of all future generations are upon you. And, if you choose to fail us, I say: 'We will never forgive you'\". So, how about her mental health? And, while we're about it, does anyone have the right to comment on it? What's so impressive about Thunberg is how clear-headed she is on the urgent need for action in the light of the science. Understandably, Thunberg particularly resents her mental capacity being called into question. \"Being different is not an illness and the current, best available science is not opinions - it's facts\", she said this week.  She acknowledges that she was very unhappy in the past, but says that championing the climate issue has helped lift her out of despair.   \"It makes me feel good that I'm not alone in this fight,\" she told me, \"and it feels like my life has some kind of meaning lately and I feel that what I am doing is meaningful.\" She's famously described her Asperger's as a \"superpower\", allowing her to cut through the noise and see to the heart of the issue.    This video can not be played Dr James Cusack, director of science at the autism charity, Autistica, says she's been a really important role model for others with the condition. \"Her brave, clear-minded and science-led approach to activism is inspiring for many people,\" he says. And, while Thunberg is sometimes emotional about her cause she says that's because she's appalled and frustrated that the world isn't doing enough to tackle climate change.  She has the full support of her family. Her father, Svante Thunberg, is travelling in America with her - and shared the privations on her transatlantic voyage.  Her mother and younger sister, Beata, stayed in Sweden. She's no plans to stop campaigning any time soon.   These coming months are crucial, she told me, if the world is going to manage to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Emissions have to start reducing before the end of next year, she warns, or we are likely to pass tipping points leading to uncontrolled climate change.     Yet, last year global carbon emissions increased by 2.7%, hitting  a record high of 37.1bn tonnes .  Thunberg was upset by the response of the world leaders in the UN HQ this week.  They politely applauded her speech but had no new initiatives that would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and most also failed to acknowledge either her message or the fact that millions of people had taken to the streets to demand action just days before. So, climate action remains very much a work in progress for Thunberg, despite her critics.   \"I guess they must feel threatened by us,\" she wrote this week. \"But the world is waking up.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent After a three-year delay, the US has become the first nation in the world to formally withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. President Trump announced the move in June 2017, but UN regulations meant that his decision only takes effect today, the day after the US election. The US could re-join it in future, should a president choose to do so. The Paris deal was drafted in 2015 to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.  It aims to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C. The delay is down to the complex rules that were built into the Paris agreement to cope with the possibility that a future US president might decide to withdraw the country from the deal.  Previous attempts to put together a global pact on climate change had foundered because of internal US politics.  The Clinton administration was unable to secure Senate backing for the  Kyoto Protocol , agreed in 1997.  So in the run up to the Paris climate talks, President Obama's negotiators wanted to ensure that it would take time for the US to get out if there was a change in leadership. Even though the agreement was signed in December 2015, the  treaty only came into force on 4 November 2016 , 30 days after at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it.  No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification.  Even then, a member state still had to serve a 12-month notice period on the UN.  This video can not be played So, despite President Trump's  White House announcement in June 2017 , the US was only able to formally give notice to the UN in November last year. The time has elapsed and the US is now out.  While the US now represents around 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it remains the world's biggest and most powerful economy.  So when it becomes the only country to withdraw from a global solution to a global problem it raises questions of trust.  For the past three years, US negotiators have attended UN climate talks while the administration has tried  to use these events to promote fossil fuels .  \"Being out formally obviously hurts the US reputation,\" said Andrew Light, a former senior climate change official in the Obama administration. \"This will be the second time that the United States has been the primary force behind negotiating a new climate deal - with the Kyoto Protocol we never ratified it, in the case of the Paris Agreement, we left it.\" \"So, I think it's obviously a problem.\" Although this has been a long time coming, there is still a palpable sense of disappointment for many Americans who believe that climate change is the biggest global challenge and the US should be leading the fight against it.  \"The decision to leave the Paris agreement was wrong when it was announced and it is still wrong today,\" said Helen Mountford from the  World Resources Institute .  \"Simply put the US should stay with the other 189 parties to the agreement, not go out alone.\" The formal withdrawal has also re-opened old wounds for climate diplomats.  \"It's definitely a big blow to the Paris agreement,\" said Carlos Fuller, from Belize, the lead negotiator for the  Alliance of Small Island States  in the UN talks.  \"We actually worked very hard to ensure that every country in the world could accede to this new agreement. And so, by losing one, we feel that basically we have failed.\" Others say that the US pull-out is partly due to the failure of the Obama administration to have the Paris agreement ratified by the US Senate.  \"What Obama did at the end of his second term was fundamentally undemocratic, to sign up to a Paris agreement without going to the Senate and the Congress and instead doing it via executive order,\" said former UN climate chief, Yvo De Boer.  \"And then, in a way, you're setting yourself up for what has happened now.\" Yes, it could.  In fact, while on the campaign trail, Joe Biden said he would seek to re-join as soon as possible - if he was elected President. Under the rules, all that is required is a month's notice and the US should be back in the fold. However, even if the US chose to re-enter the agreement, there would be consequences for being out - even for a few months.  \"We know that the UK and the EU and the UN Secretary General are planning an event on 12 December, on the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of negotiations for the Paris agreement, where they're going to try to drive more ambition,\" said Andrew Light.  \"Under the Paris rules, the US will not be able to participate in that.\" President Trump made leaving Paris a key part of his election platform in 2016, tying it into his vision of a revitalised US with booming energy production, especially coal and oil. His perspective on the Paris agreement was that it was unfair to the US, leaving countries like India and China free to use fossil fuels while the US had to curb their carbon. \"I'm not sure what Paris actually accomplishes,\" said Katie Tubb, a senior policy analyst at the  Heritage Foundation , a conservative US think tank. \"In terms of getting to the end of the century, if the goal is to reduce global temperatures, it just can't be done on the backs of the industrialised world.\" \"No matter what you think about global warming, and the nature of it, the pace of it, you have to take these growing economies seriously, and help them and I just didn't see Paris getting to that end, in any efficient or constructive manner.\" In the wake of the President's announcement back in 2017, a number of states and businesses have pledged to continue cutting carbon and to try and make up for the Federal government's decision to walk away from the US commitment under Paris.  Among them are  America's Pledge , put together by former California governor Jerry Brown and the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg.  They say that states and cities will help cut US emissions by 19% compared to 2025 from what they were in 2005 - that's not enough to make up for the US promise under Paris but it keeps those targets \"within reach\". \"The public understands that fighting climate change goes hand in hand with protecting our health and growing our economy,\" said Michael Bloomberg in a statement. \"So despite the White House's best efforts to drag our country backward, it hasn't stopped our climate progress over the past four years.\" On the business front, there has been growing pressure from shareholders of large fossil fuel-based industries to face up to the climate challenge.  A proposal filed by BNP Paribas Asset Management won a 53% majority vote at Chevron - it called on the oil giant to ensure that its climate lobbying was in line with the goals of the Paris agreement.  \"I don't think anyone will follow Mr Trump out of Paris,\" said Peter Betts, a former lead negotiator for the UK and the EU in the global climate negotiations, and now an associate fellow at  Chatham House .  \"Nobody has in the last four years and I don't think they will in the future.\" Some are worried that the US withdrawal will see other countries adopt a go-slow attitude, at a time when scientists are saying that efforts should be speeded up.  A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia  have already shown a willingness to side with US efforts  to push back on the science around global warming.  \"They are biding their time, they are saying that if the US is not in then we don't need to rush to do anything at this time',\" said Carlos Fuller, lead negotiator from the Alliance of Small Island States.  \"I think they are hedging their bets to see what kind of a better deal they can get out of it, and not actually withdraw.\" Others are hopeful that the US withdrawal will drive a sense of unity among others, and see new leadership emerge.  \"The EU green deal and  carbon neutrality commitments from China , Japan and South Korea point to the inevitability of our collective transition off fossil fuels,\" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris agreement and now chief executive of the  European Climate Foundation . \"There were always going to be speed bumps as the global economy shifted off oil, gas and coal - but the overall direction of travel is clear. As governments prepare stimulus packages to rescue their economies from covid-19 it's vital they invest in technologies of the future, not the past.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg chose to sail to a UN climate conference in New York in a zero-emissions yacht rather than fly - to highlight the impact of aviation on the environment. The 16-year-old Swede has previously travelled to London and other European cities by train. Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have faced criticism over opting to fly to Sir Elton John's villa in Nice in a private jet.  So what is the environmental impact of flying and how do trips by train, car or boat compare?  Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming when released into the atmosphere. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  That's equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK or about the same as those caused by someone living in Ghana over a year. Aviation contributes about 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). It predicts  passenger numbers will double to 8.2 billion in 2037. . And as other sectors of the economy become greener - with more wind turbines, for example - aviation's proportion of total emissions is set to rise. It depends where passengers sit and whether they are taking a long-haul flight or a shorter one. The flight figures in the table are for economy class. For long haul flights, carbon emissions per passenger per kilometre travelled are about three times higher for business class and four times higher for first class, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). This is because there's more space per seat, so each person accounts for a larger amount of the whole plane's pollution. Taking off uses more fuel than cruising. For shorter flights, this accounts for a larger proportion of the journey. And it means lower emissions for direct flights than multi-leg trips. Also, newer planes can be more efficient and some airlines and routes are better at filling seats than others. One analysis found  wide variation between per passenger emissions for different airlines . For private jets, although the planes are smaller, the emissions are split between a much smaller number of people. For example,  Prince Harry and Meghan's recent return flight to Nice  would have emitted about four times as much CO2 per person as an equivalent economy flight. The increased warming effect other, non-CO2, emissions, such as nitrogen oxides, have when they are released at high altitudes can also make a significant difference to emissions calculations. \"The climate effect of non-CO2 emissions from aviation is much greater than the equivalent from other modes of transport, as these non-CO2 greenhouse gases formed at higher altitudes persist for longer than at the surface and also have a stronger warming potential,\" Eloise Marais, from the Atmospheric Composition Group, at the University of Leicester, told BBC News. But there is scientific uncertainty about how this effect should be represented in calculators.  The ICAO excludes it, while the BEIS includes it as an option - using a 90% increase to reflect it. The EcoPassenger calculator - launched by the International Railways Union in cooperation with the European Environment Agency - says it depends on the height the plane reaches.  Longer flights are at higher altitude, so the calculator multiplies by numbers ranging from 1.27 for flights of 500km (300 miles) to 2.5 for those of more than 1,000km.  In the chart above, the high-altitude, non-CO2 emissions are in a different colour.  Train virtually always comes out better than plane, often by a lot. A journey from London to Madrid would emit 43kg (95lb) of CO2 per passenger by train, but 118kg by plane (or 265kg if the non-CO2 emissions are included), according to EcoPassenger. However, the margin between train and plane emissions varies, depending on several factors, including the type of train. For electric trains, the way the electricity they use is generated is used to calculate carbon emissions. Diesel trains' carbon emissions can be twice those of electric ones. Figures from the UK Rail Safety and Standards board show some diesel locomotives emit more than 90g of C02 per passenger per kilometre, compared with about 45g for an electric Intercity 225, for example. The source of the electricity can make a big difference if you compare a country such as France, where about 75% of electricity comes from nuclear power, with Poland, where about 80% of grid power is generated from coal. According to EcoPassenger, for example, a train trip from Paris to Bordeaux (about 500km) emits just 4.4kg of carbon dioxide per passenger, while a journey between the Polish cities of Gdansk and Katowice (about 465km) emits 61.8kg. As with plane journeys, another factor is how full the train is - a peak-time commuter train will have much lower emissions per person than a late-night rural one, for example. Yes, if the car's electric - but diesel and petrol cars are also in many cases better options than flying, though it depends on various factors, particularly how many people they're carrying. According to EcoPassenger, a journey from London to Madrid can be done with lower emissions per passenger by plane, even accounting for the effect of high altitude non-CO2 emissions, if the car is carrying just one person and the plane is full. If you add just one more person into the vehicle, the car wins out. Coaches also score well.  BEIS says travelling by coach emits 27g of CO2 per person per kilometre , compared with 41g on UK rail (but only 6g on Eurostar) - though again this will vary depending on how full they are and the engine type. The BEIS has also put a figure on ferry transport - 18g of CO2 per passenger kilometre for a foot passenger, which is less than a coach, or 128g for a driver and car, which is more like a long-haul flight. But ferries' ages and efficiency will vary around the world - and a ferry won't get you to America, although a cruise ship or ocean liner would. The cruise industry has long been under pressure to reduce environmental impacts ranging from waste disposal to air pollution, as well as high emissions - not only from travel but also from powering all the on-board facilities. Carnival Corporation and plc, which owns nine cruise lines,  says its 104 ships emit an average of 251g of carbon dioxide equivalent per \"available lower berth\" per kilometre . And, while the figures are not directly comparable, they suggest cruising falls in similar territory to flying in terms of emissions. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News, Washington DC Snowy mountain winters are being \"squeezed\" by climate change, according to scientists in California.  Researchers who studied the winter snowfall in the mountains there revealed that rising temperatures are reducing the period during which snow is on the ground in the mountains - snow that millions rely on for their fresh water.  They presented their findings at the American Geophysical Union meeting - the world's largest gathering of Earth and space scientists.  \"Our winters are getting sick and we know why,\" said Prof Amato Evan, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, who carried out the investigation. \"It's climate change; it's rising temperatures.\" Prof Evan studied the annual cycle of snow and melt in the western US from the early 1980s to 2018.  He found that the length of time snow is on the ground there is continually \"being squeezed\" into a shorter period. And the early arrival of summer, he explained, is a driving force behind sometimes devastating wildfires.     \"Particularly in a place like California where we get all of our precipitation during the winter time, that means that our summers are growing longer,\" he told BBC News. \"And really what that means is our fire seasons are growing longer. \"We've got less snow, we've got a longer fire season, we've got infestations [of pests that thrive in warmer temperatures] - these ecological issues; it's a kind of perfect storm of really bad outcomes, which then result in - in some cases - these massively dramatic fires.\" Donal O'Leary from the University of Maryland, who presented his research on what he called the \"significant relationship\" between snow and wildfire, agreed.  Earlier snowmelt, he said, \"is leading to more wildfires, particularly in places like the Sierra Nevada in California\". Mountain snow is also what millions of people rely on for fresh water supplies - in California, particularly, the reservoirs are refilled by annual snowmelt. Other scientists who have looked at global climate models have seen similar results across much of the Northern Hemisphere. And researchers say this signal from the snowpack is clear evidence that the impacts of climate change are now playing out in the mountains.

{"id":null,"body":"The impoverished African nation of Burundi comes top of a list of the world's most food-insecure countries says Christian Aid.  The charity argues that Burundi and others are now keenly feeling the impacts of climate change on their food production systems. But Burundi's contribution to rising temperatures is marginal, say experts.  In fact, the annual carbon emissions of one Briton is equal to the CO2 produced by over 200 Burundians. Scientists and government officials from all over the world  are meeting  in Geneva this week to consider how climate change impacts the land and how the lands and forests impact the climate.  Their detailed report will be released on Thursday.  However, researchers at development charity Christian Aid have put together  a study  showing how that climate change is now having a disproportionate impact on the food systems of the countries that have done least to produce the carbon emissions that are driving up temperatures.  Their study says that the top 10 most food insecure countries all generate less than half a tonne of CO2 per person, and in total just 0.08% of global emissions.  Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the world As well as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Yemen and Sierra Leone make up the top five countries. The rest of the top 10 includes Chad, Malawi, Haiti, Niger and Zambia.  Burundians produce 0.027 tonnes of CO2 per person per year. Someone living in Saudi Arabia produces the same as 718 people in Burundi. The equivalent number for the US would be 581 and for Russia 454. The report's authors draw a clear link between rising global temperatures and increasing food security issues.  \"Our research shows that rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are reducing the nutritional quality of the food we eat and that the most vulnerable people to these impacts are those least responsible for rising global CO2 concentrations,\" said Dr Samuel Myers, principal research scientist at Harvard University's department of environmental health. \"From this, and other research, what is quite clear is that climate change is not only a global health crisis, it is a moral crisis.\" Other researchers say that the report on food insecurity is a warning for rich and poor alike, that climate change is having profound effects on our ability to feed the planet.  \"These are warning signals that all of us ignore at our peril, for agriculture ultimately is one of the most threatened of our economic sectors and most fundamental for the healthy functioning of our societies and our communities,\" said Dr Doreen Stabinsky, professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic in Maine, US, who was not involved with the study. \"Both the Christian Aid report and the upcoming IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land begin to make clear how serious a threat this is, and how urgently we need to act.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Clara Guibourg and Helen Briggs BBC News  The popularity of vegan foods continues to grow, with January seen as a traditional time to consider giving them a try. Milk alternatives, such as oat, soy, almond or coconut, are one area of interest, with sales rising in the UK. A scientific study suggests the greenhouse gas emissions used in the production of plant-based milks are lower than for dairy milk. But which milk has the smallest impact on the planet?  Looking at the global averages illustrated in the chart below, producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times the greenhouse gas emissions of any non-dairy milks,  according to a University of Oxford study. Looking at land use, the difference is starker still.  Producing a glass of dairy milk every day for a year requires 650 sq m (7,000 sq ft) of land, the equivalent of two tennis courts and more than 10 times as much as the same amount of oat milk, according to this study.  Almond milk requires more water to produce than soy or oat milk. A single glass requires 74 litres (130 pints of water) - more than a typical shower. Rice milk is also comparatively thirsty, requiring 54 litres of water per glass.  However, it's worth noting that both almond and rice milk still require less water to produce than the typical glass of dairy milk.  Where something is produced can mean there is a variation in its impact on the climate, see the chart below on dairy milk. On a more local level, sourcing products made close to home may result in a smaller carbon footprint than products that have had to be transported a long way. The graphic below takes into account emissions from farming and in addition it includes transportation, packing and processing. Where livestock feed has had an impact on deforestation, this figure has also been included.

You can read more about how it was made at the foot of this page. Read more about it  here . If you cannot view the food calculator,  click to launch the interactive content . Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all human-produced greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming,  according to the study  on which the calculator is based, by Joseph Poore, of the University of Oxford. The research found meat and other animal products were responsible for most food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories consumed. People tend to underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions from food, and dairy milk is no exception, according to research by Dr Adrian Camilleri, a psychologist at the University of Technology Sydney.  \"The greenhouse gas emissions from milk are about 30 times higher than what people estimate,\" he told BBC News.   \"I suspect that most consumers underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions saved by switching from dairy milk to plant-based milk such as soy milk.\" Sales of so-called alternative milks are growing faster in the UK than sales of traditional milk, according to market researchers Mintel.  Searches for milk alternatives spike in January in the UK - especially soy milk and almond milk. Oat milk companies have recently entered the UK market, giving the drink a boost in search interest. No other country in the world has had higher search interest in oat milk than the UK in the past 12 months.  Last year, a record 50,000 people signed up to the Veganuary campaign to live without animal products for a month. But the growing popularity of veganism extends beyond January. Searches for veganism have doubled in the past year.  So to what extent do plant-based diets' trendiness translate to actual numbers? There are about 540,000 vegans in the UK, according to a  2016 survey by the Vegan Society , estimated to be up from 150,000 in 2006.  Yet, some farming bodies are critical of the idea of Veganuary. The campaign ignores the fact sheep farming in the UK \"works very much in harmony with our environment, our landscapes, and our human ecology\", according to the National Sheep Association.  Red meat from livestock raised on grass was different from intensive animal farming, said chief executive Phil Stocker. \"Some people seem hell bent on portraying sheep as a global enemy - but in fact they are the ultimate in renewable technology and are an efficient form of productive land management that is planet-friendly,\" he added. University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the  Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland , looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on  serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA)  and  healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA . The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often  lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants  and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. Dairy, soy and almond milks were set to 3.3% protein, while rice and oat were standardised based on their lower protein content. The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The  European Environment Agency  estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq\/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile. Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the  Committee on Climate Change , and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the  Carbon Neutral calculator . The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on  figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes  and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data. Update 22nd February 2019: This article has been updated to include more detail about the methodology used. A chart has also been added showing the environmental impact of cow's milk, broken down by region. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Is going vegan for January worth it?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UK businesses will have to show that their products and supply lines are free from illegal deforestation, under government plans. A proposed law would require larger companies operating in the UK to show where commodities such as cocoa, soy, rubber and palm oil originated from. It would be illegal to use products that fail to comply with laws to protect nature in those origin nations.  Critics though say the plan is flawed and lacks detail on penalties.  There has been growing dissatisfaction among consumers about products that are connected to illegal deforestation, especially in the Amazon. According to a new survey from environmental group, WWF, 67% of British consumers want the government to do more to tackle the issue.  Some 81% of respondents in the survey said there should be greater transparency about the origins of products that are imported into the UK. Fuelling these concerns are reports showing that  deforestation in the Amazon has increased sharply this year . The felling of trees and the clearing of land, usually for agriculture, is responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  The vast majority of it is illegal. The UK government now says it wants to address this issue by introducing a law to ensure that the supply chains of larger companies and the products they sell are free from illegal deforestation. Companies would have to ensure that commodities such as palm and soy were produced in line with local laws protecting forests and other natural ecosystems.  Businesses would have to publish information showing the origins of products or face fines.  \"There is a hugely important connection between the products we buy and their wider environmental footprint, which is why the government is consulting today on new measures that would make it illegal for businesses in the UK to use commodities that are not grown in accordance with local laws,\" said international environment minister Lord Goldsmith.   \"Ahead of hosting the UN climate change conference next year, the UK has a duty to lead the way in combating the biodiversity and nature crisis now upon us.\" The plans for a new law were given a cautious welcome by some environmental campaigners. \"This consultation is a welcome first step in the fight to tackle the loss of our planet's irreplaceable natural wonders such as the Amazon and in the pursuit of supply chains free from products that contribute to deforestation,\" said Ruth Chambers, from the Greener UK coalition. \"The evidence linking deforestation with climate change, biodiversity loss and the spread of zoonotic diseases is compelling. A new law is an important part of the solution and is urgently needed. But others argued that the proposal was flawed and did nothing tackle demand.  \"Companies including supermarkets and fast food retailers must make full transparency of supply chains a condition of trade,\" said Greenpeace UK. \"That will mean reducing the amount of high risk commodities like meat, dairy, animal feed soya and palm oil they're buying.\" \"Proactively, the UK government and industry needs to support a just transition at home and in forest regions to food systems that work with nature, including the restoration of natural ecosystems.\" As the host of the delayed climate conference, COP26, the UK is under pressure to show international leadership on climate issues. Deforestation is one of the key issues where the government hopes to see progress made on the international stage. In June, ministers committed an \u00a316m in funding to help scale up environmentally friendly farming and forest conservation in the Amazon. Details of the consultation on the proposed new law can be found  here.  It will run for six weeks. Follow Matt  on Twitter. .

{"id":null,"body":"Protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) is carrying out a week of demonstrations to highlight government inaction on climate change.  On Wednesday, some protesters glued themselves to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over the government's commitment to keep drilling for North Sea oil and gas. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the group via social media: \"You cannot - and we won't - switch off domestic oil and gas production.\" Extinction Rebellion protests this week have focused on tackling the UK's reliance on oil and other fossil fuels.  XR Scientists - the sub-group protesting at BEIS - has accused the government of \"irresponsible and dangerous pursuit\" of fossil fuels, which is incompatible with climate change.  The UK currently  gets 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. In April, the government published the new UK Energy Security Strategy, which included new licensing for North Sea oil and gas, and a new investigation into fracking. The group describes itself as an international \"non-violent civil disobedience\" movement. It says life on Earth is in crisis and facing a mass extinction. It wants governments to declare a \"climate and ecological emergency\" and take immediate action. The group uses an hourglass inside a circle as its logo, to represent time running out for many species.  2025 the year the group wants greenhouse emmissions to reach net zero 408,000 followers on Facebook 3,672 XR demonstrators arrested across the three London protests 2018 year the group was founded In the UK, Extinction Rebellion  has three main demands: Reducing CO2 emissions to almost zero in such a short period would be extremely ambitious.  Severe restrictions on flying would be needed. Diets would have to change by drastically cutting back on meat and dairy.  And there would have to be a  massive increase in renewable energy, along with many other radical changes. This video can not be played However, the group itself doesn't say exactly what the solutions to tackle climate change should be. Instead, it wants the government to create a \"citizens' assembly\", made up of ordinary people. They would decide how to solve the climate crisis, with advice from experts.  The group often uses disruptive tactics to highlight its demands.  Police  made 480 arrests during protests in London last year. Across a two-week period in August and September, activists blocked Oxford Circus and erected a giant table in Covent Garden. More than 130 people locked or glued themselves to roads and buildings.  This followed previous campaigns across London, Manchester and Cardiff in 2019 and 2020.  There have also been protests in other countries: Insulate Britain launched last autumn and called for a national programme to ensure homes are insulated to be low energy by 2030. It is supported by some members of Extinction Rebellion and its allied networks - although the groups are not officially integrated.  Insulate Britain is a much smaller UK-specific campaigning organisation. Many of those directly affected by protests have objected to the tactics used by both Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accused both groups of being \"crusties\" who block the streets and cause disruption. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said  while there was a place for direct action , Insulate Britain was \"not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way\". But District Judge Stephen Leake who fined some Insulate Britain protesters for blocking the M25 motorway, said he was \"inspired\" by their climate concerns.  Younger people are most likely to agree with its aims,  according to a survey of more than 3,000 people carried out after the London 2019 protests. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, 41% either \"strongly supported\" or \"somewhat supported\" the disruption of traffic and public transport in London to highlight Extinction Rebellion's aims. That compared with 33% of those aged 50-65, and 26% of over-65s.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent You're probably reading this on your phone. If not, take it out your pocket and look at it. It's a smartphone, isn't it? Think how often you use it and all the useful things it helps you do. Now, think back. How long since you bought your first smartphone? It will be about 10 years, most likely a bit less. Not long. Yet they are now ubiquitous: virtually everyone, everywhere has one and uses it for hours every day. It shows how quickly new technology can take off. The original iPhone was only introduced in 2007 and - bizarre as it now seems - it wasn't regarded as revolutionary back then. Check out this Forbes magazine cover published nine months after the iPhone was released. Forbes cover 10 years ago.  pic.twitter.com\/EBlHpdRDsl And Forbes wasn't alone. The iPhone was just \"one more entrant into an already very busy space,\" according to the boss of the company that made Blackberrys. Remember them? Not only have smartphones crushed all other phone technologies, they have upended dozens of other industries too. They've killed the camera and powered the rise of social media and dating apps. They've decimated the traditional taxi industry. So what has this got to do with energy? It proves an important point about all successful new technologies: it is easy to see why they were so transformative in hindsight, much harder to predict how they will reshape our world in advance. Which brings me to green technology - wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, that kind of thing. If you still think adopting these new technologies will be an expensive chore, think again. Green tech is at a tipping point where it could take off explosively - just like the smartphone did. And, just like the smartphone, it could bring a revolution in how we do much more than just create energy. So why did the smartphone do so well?  Its success was down to a unique convergence of technologies. For the first time, touchscreens, batteries, data networks, compact computer chips, micro-sensors and more were cheap, reliable and small enough to make a $600 (\u00a3460) smartphone possible. And as demand for smartphones picked up, manufacturers learned how to make those technologies even cheaper and better too. Something similar is now happening with green tech. After years of development, it is becoming much cheaper and more effective. The world's best solar power schemes are now the \"cheapest source of electricity in history\", the International Energy Agency (IEA), which analyses energy markets, said this month. \"Renewable energy is likely to penetrate the energy system more quickly than any fuel ever seen in history,\" predicts Spencer Dale, the chief economist at the oil giant BP. And BP is putting its money where Mr Dale's mouth is. It's pledged to cut its oil and gas production by 40% in the next 10 years, and to plough money into developing its low-carbon business instead. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, announced a \u00a3160m investment that he said would see offshore wind producing more than half of current UK electricity demand by 2030. That's right. An investment of just \u00a3160m in offshore wind when the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, is costing at least \u00a322.5 billion. How is it so cheap? Because the UK government won't be paying for the new wind turbines, the private sector will.  In the UK, offshore wind will soon be profitable without subsidy. Indeed, developers may soon have to pay for access to our continental shelf. Think what that means. You don't need governments offering inducements for companies to build new renewable power, they'll be paying us for the privilege of doing so. But that is just the beginning. What happens when the world doubles down on cutting carbon? The European Union  has already signed up to a \u20ac1tn-plus green stimulus plan . China says it is on board too.  At the United Nations' General Assembly meeting in New York this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an unconditional commitment that China  would cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060 .  Japan and South Korea both announced a 2050 net zero pledge this week, and if Joe Biden wins the American presidential election,  he has similarly ambitious carbon cutting plans . Both Biden and the EU have warned they will introduce carbon tariffs to penalise countries that haven't abated emissions selling high-carbon products in their markets. That'll be a powerful encouragement for the rest of the world to follow suit. But even if they don't, we'd have America, China and Europe - half of world emissions and more than half of world GDP - doubling down on cutting carbon. That means even more investment in wind, solar, batteries, electric cars, electrolysis, carbon capture and storage, and any other green technology you can think of. Just like with the smartphone, it becomes a virtuous cycle. \"What we've seen up to now is called a learning curve,\" explains Spencer Dale. \"The more you produce something, the better you get at producing it.\" As the amount of solar and wind capacity in the world has doubled and doubled again, the costs have steadily fallen -  something documented by the clean tech advocate Ramez Naam .  \"And at the moment there doesn't seem to be any sign that those learning curves are flattening out,\" says Mr Dale. If he's right, then costs will continue to fall, making renewables increasingly competitive, which in turn will lead to more investment and more renewable power. You get the idea. Let's now do a thought experiment. The big challenge with renewables is what they call in the trade \"intermittency\" - the fact that you don't get any power when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. It is a big problem. Nobody wants the power to go off.  RethinkX, an American think tank specialising in blue-skies thinking on the future of industries,  says we need to change our whole mindset about how we generate power .  We are used to worrying about the costs of overcapacity - producing more power than is needed. That's because the fuel used to generate power is expensive.   Not so with renewables. Once you've built them, the power they generate from the wind and sun comes virtually free of charge. RethinkX says this will do to energy what the internet and smartphones have done to data. Thirty years ago there was an inherent physical cost to every newspaper printed or photo taken. Now that everything is digital, the only limit on how much we read or post on Instagram is the number of hours in our day. RethinkX argues that instead of simply replacing existing fossil fuel plants with wind and solar - and then worrying about the cost of plugging those big intermittency gaps - we should just build more and more and more wind and solar, perhaps several times the capacity of the existing electricity grid. Remember, the more we build, the cheaper it gets. So long as we spread them over a wide enough area we'll always get some power. And we can plug the few small gaps remaining with batteries or other power plants.   And here's the thing. On sunny and windy days we'll have a huge surplus of electricity at pretty much no extra cost. What could you do with huge amounts of cheap power?  You'll certainly want to use it to make more wind turbines and solar panels. But what about electrolysing water to produce hydrogen that can heat homes, power trucks and ships, or make steel? You could power machines to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Or how about a plant to make carbon-neutral aviation fuel from that hydrogen and carbon dioxide? Or a desalination plant to irrigate a desert? RethinkX even suggests the power could be used to mine for cryptocurrencies. The point is this: the cost of energy is a key constraint in virtually everything we do. So new industries are likely rise up to make use of this plentiful power. Obviously they'll have to pay something for this bounty and that'll mean the power that boils your kettle and charges your electric car will be cheaper too. Of course, we are a long way from this utopia. The chances are this vision of unlimited, virtually cost-free energy, may not come to pass - or at least not in the 10-year timeframe they predict. The sheer physical challenge of building so much new infrastructure means it will take time to build up the supply chains and raw materials needed, and there may be limits to how much solar and wind some countries can harness. But the central point remains: there are powerful forces driving down the cost of renewable technologies that upend the traditional narrative of decarbonisation. Contrary to what we are normally told, switching to low-carbon energy doesn't have to be an onerous obligation that will impoverish us and make life less exciting. Instead, it could open up a world of new opportunities, new businesses and livelihoods. And what's more, this could all happen quite soon.  Spencer Dale quotes the eminent German economist, Rudi Dornbusch who said: \"In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.\" And if you don't believe that, just think about all the changes your smartphone has helped bring about in the world.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Madrid Climate change and nutrient pollution are driving the oxygen from our oceans, and threatening many species of fish. That's the conclusion of the biggest study of its kind, undertaken by conservation group IUCN. While nutrient run-off has been known for decades, researchers say that climate change is making the lack of oxygen worse.  Around 700 ocean sites are now suffering from low oxygen, compared with 45 in the 1960s.  Researchers say the depletion is threatening species including tuna, marlin and sharks. The threat to oceans from nutrient run-off of chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus from farms and industry has long been known to impact the levels of oxygen in the sea waters and still remains the primary factor, especially closer to coasts. However, in recent years the threat from climate change has increased.  As more carbon dioxide is released enhancing the greenhouse effect, much of the heat is absorbed by the oceans. In turn, this warmer water can hold less oxygen. The scientists estimate that between 1960 and 2010, the amount of the gas dissolved in the oceans declined by 2%.  This video can not be played That may not seem like much as it is a global average, but in some tropical locations the loss can range up to 40%. Even small changes can impact marine life in a significant way.  So waters with less oxygen favour species such as jellyfish, but not so good for bigger, fast-swimming species like tuna.  \"We have known about de-oxygenation but we haven't known the linkages to climate change and this is really worrying,\" said Minna Epps from IUCN. \"Not only has the decline of oxygen quadrupled in the past 50 years but even in the best case emissions scenario, oxygen is still going to decline in the oceans.\" For species like tuna, marlin and some sharks that are particularly sensitive to lack of oxygen - this is bad news.  Bigger fish like these have greater energy needs. According to the authors, these animals are starting to move to the shallow surface layers of the seas where there is more of the gas dissolved.  However, this make the species much more vulnerable to over-fishing.  If countries continue with a business-as-usual approach to emissions, the world's oceans are expected to lose 3-4% of their oxygen by the year 2100.  This is likely to be worse in the tropical regions of the world. Much of the loss is expected in the top 1,000m of the water column, which is richest in biodiversity. Low levels of oxygen are also bad for basic processes like the cycling of elements crucial for life on Earth, including nitrogen and phosphorous. \"If we run out of oxygen it will mean habitat loss and biodiversity loss and a slippery slope down to slime and more jellyfish,\" said Minna Epps. \"It will also change the energy and the biochemical cycling in the oceans and we don't know what these biological and chemical shifts in the oceans can actually do.\" This video can not be played Changing the outcomes for the oceans is down to the world's political leaders which is why the report has been launched here at COP25. \"Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification,\" said Dan Laffoley, also from IUCN and the report's co-editor. \"To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas, we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A drought, equal to the worst to have hit the western US in recorded history, is already under way, say scientists. Researchers say the megadrought is a naturally occurring event that started in the year 2000 and is still ongoing. Climate change, though, is having a major impact with rising temperatures making the drought more severe. Some researchers are more cautious, saying that it is too early to say if the region really is seeing a true megadrought.  According to the authors of this new paper, a megadrought in North America refers to a multi-decade event, that contains periods of very high severity that last longer than anything observed during the 19th or 20th centuries.  The authors say there have been around 40 drought events over the period from 800-2018 in the western US.  Of these, only four meet the criteria for a megadrought.  These were in the late 800s, the mid-1100s, the 1200s and the late 1500s. The key to this new study is the use of tree ring records to reconstruct soil moisture data for the past 1200 years.  The team were also able to use supporting evidence such as medieval tree stumps growing in normally wet river beds, the abandonment of settlements by indigenous civilisations at the peak of the 13th century drought, plus evidence from lake deposits indicating wildfire activity was enhanced during these drought periods.  The researchers discovered that when they compared the worst 19-year drought events in the past to soil moisture records from 2000-2018, the current period is already worse than three of the four megadroughts recorded. The fourth one, which ran from 1575 to 1603 was likely the worst one of all, but the difference with the present event is slight.  \"The first two decades of this drought look just like the first two decades of all of the mega droughts,\" said lead author Dr Park Williams, from Columbia University in New York. \"In fact, it is essentially tied with the worst two decades of the worst of the mega droughts.\" The authors say that undoubtedly the current drought situation is a natural event but is being made much worse by climate change.  The key event seems to have been the El Ni\u00f1o\/La Ni\u00f1a weather phenomenon. \"We know from, from many lines of evidence that when you have La Ni\u00f1a type conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, then the southwestern US and northern Mexico get dry. And that's what we've seen over the last two decades,\" said Dr Williams. But climate change has super-charged the current drought. The authors say that in the western US, temperatures have gone up by 1.2C since 2000. Hotter air holds more moisture and that moisture is being pulled out of the ground. They believe that climate change is responsible for about half of of the pace and severity of the current event.  \"It doesn't matter if this is exactly the worst drought ever,\" said co-author Benjamin Cook, who is affiliated with Columbia University and Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \"What matters is that it has been made much worse than it would have been because of climate change.\" The authors say the two most important water reservoirs in the region, Lake Powell and Lake Mead have both shrunk dramatically during the drought. Wildfires across the region are growing in area.  \"At any given year, there's over ten times more forest area burns than we would have expected in a given year, 40 years ago,\" said Dr Williams.  What has helped to mitigate the impact of the drought has been groundwater - the water held underground in aquifers. This has increasingly been used to bolster supplies for agriculture.  The longer the drought goes on, the deeper into these reserves that people are digging, and they take a long time to replenish. No. This new study is contentious, especially as the definition of what exactly a megadrought means is still being argued over.  Some say that it is also way too early to declare that a megadrought is ongoing. But even those who disagree with the idea, acknowledge there is water stress in the region and this is likely to get worse in the future.  \"Whether or not the western US has crossed a threshold into an event that goes by any specific label, what's been clear this century is that water is an essential resource in the western US, and it's a precarious one, because the region can have long spells with little precipitation,\" said Dr Angeline Pendergrass, a scientist with the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). \"And it looks like climate change won't make it better - indeed, it will likely make it worse.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Science.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Rising temperatures will change the colour of the world's oceans, making them more blue in the coming decades say scientists. They found that increased heat will change the mixture of phytoplankton or tiny marine organisms in the seas, which absorb and reflect light.  Scientists say there will be less of them in the waters in the decades to come. This will drive a colour change in more than 50% of the world's seas by 2100. Phytoplankton play a hugely important role in the oceans.  As well as turning sunlight into chemical energy, and consuming carbon dioxide, they are the bottom rung on the marine food chain. They also play an important role in how we see the oceans with our eyes.  The more phytoplankton in the water, the less blue the seas will appear, and the more likely they will be to have a greenish colour. Previous research has shown that with warming, the oceans will see a reduction in phytoplankton in many places.  This new study models the likely impact these changes will have on the colour of the ocean and the planet as the world warms up.  \"What we find is that the colour will change, probably not so much that you will see by eye, but certainly sensors will be able to pick up that there's a change,\" lead author Dr Stephanie Dutkiewicz from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.  \"And it will likely be one of the earliest warning signals that we have changed the ecology of the ocean.\" The researchers point out that the changes are an indirect impact of climate change, as warming is affecting the circulation of the seas, this is changing the amount of food available for phytoplankton.  Another difference from previous studies is that this time, the researchers are looking solely at satellite measurements of reflected light from the phytoplankton.  In the past, scientists have used satellite measurements of chlorophyll, a light harvesting pigment found in phytoplankton, to try and understand the impact of climate change. However they've had problems working out the difference between natural variability and human induced warming on this green pigment.  They believe it will be 30-40 years before they can say for definite that climate change is having an impact on chlorophyll.  \"What we've shown is that the colour in the blue green range is going to show that signal of change sooner, in some places in maybe the next decade,\" said Dr Dutkiewicz. \"More of the ocean is going to show a change in colour over the next few decades than we would see in chlorophyll, the changing colour is going to be more of a warning signal.\" The researchers believe that the North Atlantic will be one of the first places to reflect the change - followed by locations in the Southern Ocean. The team modelled what would happen to the oceans by the end of this century if the world warmed by 3C, which is close to where temperatures are likely to be, if every country sticks to the promises they have made in the Paris climate agreement.  \"There will be a noticeable difference in the colour of 50% of the ocean by the end of the 21st century,\" Dr Dutkiewicz said.  \"It could be potentially quite serious. Different types of phytoplankton absorb light differently, and if climate change shifts one community of phytoplankton to another, that will also change the types of food webs they can support. \" The team also believe that the world will see changes in some of the green shades seen in the oceans as well.  This will happen because some species of phytoplankton will respond well to a warmer environment and will create larger blooms of more diverse marine organisms.  This is likely to show up with more green regions near the equator and the poles, the researchers say. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.

{"id":null,"body":"World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life. Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.  We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions. The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.  When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and  the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50% . Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be  kept to 1.5C by 2100 .  However, unless further action is taken,  the planet could still warm by more than 2C  by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for  2.4C of warming by the end of the century. If nothing is done,  scientists think global warming could exceed 4C  in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species.  Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods.  With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as  farmland turns into desert . In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse. Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already  lost half of its corals since 1995  due to warmer seas driven by climate change. Wildfires are becoming more frequent  as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather.  And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change. In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need. Scientists believe  at least 550 species could be lost this century  if action is not taken.  Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts.  If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C: Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.  The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders,  called COP26,  in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030.  Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Experts agree that  this is achievable , but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes. Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives  can limit our impact on the climate : The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Top image from Getty Images.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Breakthrough technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen cannot be relied on to help the UK meet its climate change targets, a report says. The government had hoped that both technologies would contribute to emissions reductions required by 2050. But the report\u2019s authors say  ministers should assume that neither carbon capture and storage (CCS) nor hydrogen will be running \"at scale\" by 2050. They say the government must start a debate on other, controversial steps. These actions, which they say would need to be implemented in the near-term, include cutting down on flying and eating red meat. UK law dictates that, by 2050, carbon emissions will be virtually halted, and any remaining emissions will have to be compensated for by activities such as tree planting. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has regularly expressed the belief that technology would mostly solve the problem. But the authors say that if new tech does emerge at scale by 2050, the government should treat it as a bonus, not an expectation. Both of the new technologies in question have their supporters in politics and in industry. Hydrogen technology  entails generating hydrogen from natural gas, or from water .  CCS entails capturing CO2 emissions from power stations or industry, and burying them in rock formations or  finding uses for the CO2 .  Both are expensive . A few years ago, government economists predicted that gas plants equipped with CCS would be producing 30% of the UK\u2019s clean electricity in the future. Nuclear and renewables would produce another 30% each. Tom Burke, an expert on climate change, forecast at that time that only CCS could save the climate. When I reminded him yesterday, he admitted: \u201cI was wrong\u201d. The equation radically changed because the nuclear renaissance didn\u2019t happen; the government pulled funding from CCS projects; and the cost of renewables plummeted.  The government has now offered new CCS funds - but for tackling carbon emissions from industrial clusters, rather than from power generation.  The new technology report comes from a government-funded consortium of academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London. It\u2019s being debated in the Lords on Thursday. The debate\u2019s sponsor, Baron Browne of Ladyton, said it carries important messages that should be heard.  The report says: \u201cBusinesses and the public want to act to eliminate emissions, but exaggerated claims about the speed at which new technologies can be introduced  are holding back progress .\" It continued: \u201cRelying on breakthrough technologies to achieve zero emissions by 2050 is risky and delays action.  \u201cInstead, with today\u2019s technologies we can meet the target for almost all activities, but we have no substitutes for cement, shipping, flying, lamb or beef.\u201d  The report says the UK can anticipate having four times as much emissions-free electricity in 2050 as today if current rates of renewables expansion continue.  This, it says, is enough to supply 60% of today\u2019s energy-using activities, if they are electrified.  It says to close the remaining energy gap, we could make incremental changes to the way we use technologies - such as buying smaller cars rather than SUVs. Another option is to take the train instead of the car, or put more passengers in fewer cars (ride sharing). Yet another possibility is to only heat rooms where people are sitting, and swap gas boilers for heat pumps when they need to be changed.  The government, the report says, should start a debate on these issues. It says the two outstandingly difficult areas to de-carbonise are shipping and cement manufacture. Julian Allwood, lead author and professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, told BBC News: \"The problem with delivering climate mitigation is the tension between the government wanting to deliver solutions based on technology and protestors and scientists asking for fast action that bites much more rapidly than we can bring new technologies into place.  \"So although new technologies may become relevant by 2100, the number operating at scale in 2050 will be very few. Probably we\u2019ve got to deliver on climate change with today\u2019s technologies.\" The message contradicts several comments from the Prime Minister putting faith in technology to deliver 2050 targets. Recently, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no one needed to fly less, and that technology would solve the problem. The government has committed to having CCS in industrial clusters from the second half of the 2020s and CCS at scale by 2030. The net zero scenario from the Committee on Climate Change includes 75-175 Megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 being captured and stored per year by 2050. The report's authors say it typically takes 30 years for a major new technology such as carbon capture to solve all its complexities, including legal and safety implications; and public concerns, before it begins to be widely adopted.  But this will be too late to hit the government's 2050 targets. A government spokesperson said: \"Achieving net zero by 2050 requires decisive action across the economy, including developing a range of approaches and technologies.  \"Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), for example, can play an essential role as part of a balanced approach. Our ambition is to be a world leader in this technology.\" Follow Roger on Twitter  @RHarrabin Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News A significant shift in the system of ocean currents that helps keep parts of Europe warm could send temperatures in the UK lower, scientists have found. They say the Atlantic Ocean circulation system is weaker now than it has been for more than 1,000 years - and has changed significantly in the past 150.  The study, in the journal Nature, says it may be a response to increased melting ice and is likely to continue. Researchers say that could have an impact on Atlantic ecosystems. Scientists involved in the Atlas project - the largest study of deep Atlantic ecosystems ever undertaken - say the impact will not be of the order played out in the 2004 Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow. But they say changes to the conveyor-belt-like system - also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) - could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems. That could also affect temperature-sensitive species like coral, and even Atlantic cod.  Scientists believe the pattern is a response to fresh water from melting ice sheets being added to surface ocean water, meaning those surface waters \"can't get very dense and sink\".  \"That puts a spanner in this whole system,\" lead researcher Dr David Thornalley, from University College London, explained.   The concept of this system \"shutting down\" was featured in The Day After Tomorrow.  \"Obviously that was a sensationalised version,\" said Dr Thornally. \"But much of the underlying science was correct, and there would be significant changes to climate it if did undergo a catastrophic collapse - although the film made those effects much more catastrophic, and happening much more quickly - than would actually be the case.\"  Nonetheless, a change to the system could cool the North Atlantic and north-west Europe and transform some deep-ocean ecosystems.  That is why its measurement has been a key part of the Atlas project. Scientists say understanding what is happening to Amoc will help them make much more accurate forecasts of our future climate.  Prof Murray Roberts, who co-ordinates the Atlas project at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC News: \"The changes we're seeing now in deep Atlantic currents could have massive effects on ocean ecosystems. \"The deep Atlantic contains some of the world's oldest and most spectacular cold-water coral reef and deep-sea sponge grounds.  \"These delicate ecosystems rely on ocean currents to supply their food and disperse their offspring. Ocean currents are like highways spreading larvae throughout the ocean and we know these ecosystems have been really sensitive to past changes in the Earth's climate.\" This video can not be played To measure how the system has shifted over long timescales, researchers collected long cores of sediment from the sea floor.  The sediment was laid down by past ocean currents, so the size of the sediment grains in different layers provided a measure of the current's strength over time.  The results were also backed up by another study published in the same issue of Nature, led by researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.  This work looked at climate model data to confirm that sea-surface temperature patterns can be used as an indicator of Amoc's strength and revealing that it has been weakening even more rapidly since 1950 in response to recent global warming.  The scientists want to continue to study patterns in this crucial temperature-regulating system, to understand whether as ice sheets continue to melt, this could drive further slowdown - or even a shutdown of a system that regulates our climate.

{"id":null,"body":"Click or tap on an underlined word for a short definition or explanation The US president has a huge influence on people's lives both at home and abroad, so when the next election is held on 3 November, the outcome will matter to everyone. The US political system is dominated by just two parties, so the president always belongs to one of them.  The  Republicans  are the conservative political party in the US and their candidate in this year\u2019s election is President Donald Trump, who is hoping to secure another four years in power. The Republican Party is also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party. In recent years, it has stood for lower taxes, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration. Support for the party tends to be stronger in more rural parts of America. Former Republican presidents include George W Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. The  Democrats  are the liberal political party in the US and their candidate is Joe Biden, an experienced politician best-known for serving as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years.  The Democratic Party is best defined by its liberal stances on issues like civil rights, immigration, and climate change. It believes government should play a bigger role in people\u2019s lives, like providing health insurance. Support for the party tends to be stronger in urban parts of America. Former Democratic presidents include John F Kennedy and Barack Obama.  Both men are in their 70s - Mr Trump would be 74 years old at the start of his second term, while at 78, Mr Biden would be the oldest first-term president in history.  Both candidates compete to win  electoral college  votes.  Like most voting systems, the electoral college has a number of pros and cons but it is widely respected because of its historical roots in the founding of the US. It usually reflects the popular vote, but it has failed to in two of the last five elections, including when Donald Trump won in 2016.  Each state gets a certain number of electoral college votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.  This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it\u2019s possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like  Hillary Clinton  did in 2016 - but still be defeated by the electoral college. Hillary Clinton was Donald Trump\u2019s opponent in 2016. She ended up winning nearly three million more votes than Mr Trump, mainly because she picked up a high number of votes in strong Democrat states like New York and California. However, her rival comfortably beat her in the electoral college race 304 to 227 because he won several tight contests in key states.  All but two states have a winner-takes-all rule, so whichever candidate wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state\u2019s electoral college votes.  Most states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so the focus is usually on a dozen or so states where either of them could win. These are known as the  battleground states .  These states, which are often referred to as swing states as well, are where voters are split relatively evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Traditional battleground states include Florida and Ohio. Other states that have been strongly Republican in the past, like Arizona and Texas, are considered battlegrounds in 2020 due to increasing support for the Democratic Party. If you\u2019re a US citizen and you\u2019re 18 or over, you should be  eligible to vote  in the presidential election, which takes place every four years.  In 2016, about 245 million people were eligible to vote, but fewer than 140 million people actually did. According to the US Census Bureau, the majority of people who didn\u2019t register to vote said they just weren\u2019t interested in politics. Those who registered but didn\u2019t actually vote said they didn\u2019t like the candidates. However, lots of states have passed laws requiring voters to show identification documents to prove who they are before they can vote.  These laws are often put into place by Republicans who say they\u2019re needed to guard against voter fraud. But Democrats accuse them of using this as a form of voter suppression as it is often poorer, minority voters who are unable to provide ID like a driving licence. How people vote is a contentious issue this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some politicians are calling for wider use of postal ballots, but President Trump has said - with very little evidence - that this could result in more  voter fraud . Critics say postal ballots are susceptible to fraud - and there have been isolated incidents involving Republicans and Democrats - but numerous nationwide and state-level studies have found no evidence of any widespread fraud. No. All of the attention will be on Trump v Biden, but voters will also be choosing new members of  Congress  when they fill in their ballots.  Congress is the part of the US government that writes and passes laws. It's made up of two chambers - the House of Representatives and the Senate. Members of the House serve two-year terms while senators serve six-year terms and are split into three groups, meaning a third of them are up for election every two years. Democrats already have control of the House so they will be looking to keep hold of that while also gaining control of the Senate.  If they had a majority in both chambers they would be able to block or delay President Trump\u2019s plans if he were to be re-elected.  All 435 seats in the House are up for election this year, while 33 Senate seats are also up for grabs.  It can take several days for every vote to be counted, but it\u2019s usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning.  In 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 3am to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters.  But don\u2019t set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in  postal ballots . There are two ways to vote in the US - by going to a polling station on election day or by using a postal ballot - but the rules vary depending on which state you are in. All states offer some form of voting by post, but many require you to provide a reason for not being able to vote in person on election day. Some states are accepting the coronavirus as a valid reason to use a postal ballot, but not all of them are at the moment.  The last time the result wasn\u2019t clear within a few hours was in 2000, when the winner wasn\u2019t confirmed until  a Supreme Court  ruling was made a month later.  In 2000, the race between Republican candidate George W Bush and Democratic candidate Al Gore was so close that it came down to the result in Florida, where just a few hundred votes separated them. There were weeks of legal battles, which triggered a recount, but eventually the Supreme Court stepped in. Mr Bush was declared the winner, giving him all 25 of Florida\u2019s electoral college votes and leaving him with a winning total of 271 overall. Mr Gore, who won more votes nationally than Mr Bush, conceded defeat. If Joe Biden wins the election, he wouldn\u2019t immediately replace President Trump as there is a set transition period to give the new leader time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January in a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.  After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Climate change could have a domino effect on key infrastructure in the UK, government advisers have warned. In a 2,000-page report,  the Climate Change Committee  says flooding will destroy bridges - wrecking electricity, gas and IT connections carried on them. The committee also warns that poor farming means the most fertile soils will be badly degraded by mid-century. And heat-related deaths among the elderly will triple to 7,000 a year by the 2050s as summer temperatures rise. The UK is not prepared, the committee says, for the risks posed by climate change from flooding and changing coasts, heatwaves, water shortages, ecosystem damage and shocks to the global food system. The projections are based on the supposition that governments keep promises made at the Paris climate conference to cut emissions - a pledge that is in doubt. The committee says if emissions are allowed to spiral, London summer temperatures could hit 48C (118F) in an extreme scenario, although the advisers say they don't expect that to happen.    The report from 80 authors is the most comprehensive yet on the potential impact of climate change on the UK.  It identifies 60 risks and opportunities - many of them happening already as the climate has warmed. Its conclusions on the inter-linking nature of threats to infrastructure is based on recent research. The chairman of the committee's adaptation sub-committee, Prof Sir John Krebs, told BBC News: \"Infrastructure could be affected in a way that interacts. \"So, if you take electricity supply, the delivery of fuel to power stations might be affected by flooding which would then affect electricity. \"Then look at flooding\u2026 if bridges are affected then they carry electricity cables and communications infrastructure, so we have to look not just at how each piece of infrastructure works but how they interact together. \"There could be a cascade of risks.\" On food and farming, the committee warns that UK shoppers could face higher food bills as imported crops like soya are harmed by heat or drought. It says farming in the UK might benefit from more warmth but warns that soils are likely to dry out quicker, and that rain is more likely to arrive in unhelpful downpours.  The committee also says some of the UK's most fertile land - the peat fields of the East Anglia fens - are suffering badly from decades of intensive farming.  Prof Krebs said 85% of the peat had been washed or blown away, and the rest would follow in coming decades unless farmers were more careful. On over-heating, the committee forecasts a risk to the health of elderly people in homes, hospitals and care homes.  Prof Krebs said he had tried to insert rules in recent housing legislation to oblige builders to ensure adequate ventilation, but the government deemed these onerous to business. Dr Sari Kovats, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"We are far from prepared to deal with these changes.  \"More heatwaves in the UK are also likely, yet there are no comprehensive policies in place aimed at reducing the risk of overheating in new and existing homes.\" Among the other risks needing more action the committee mentions:  \u2022        Coastal change risks to communities, businesses and infrastructure \u2022         Risk of shortages in public water supply with impacts on freshwater ecology, water for agriculture, energy generation and industry Opportunities for the UK from climate change include: \u2022         Economic opportunities for UK businesses from an increase in global demand for adaptation-related goods and services, such as engineering and insurance \u2022         Milder winters should reduce the costs of heating, helping to cut winter cold deaths. Prof Piers Forster, from the University of Leeds, said: \"The UK gets off lighter than many countries but this important report confirms that we are already seeing damage to homes, businesses and livelihoods.  \"There are a few opportunities hidden in the mix but the future is clearly one of increased risk that we need to prepare for now.\" The report will inform the government's climate change adaptation strategy, due in 2018. Ministers are about to publish their National Flood Resilience Review. A government spokesman said: \"We are committed to making sure the UK is prepared for the challenges of climate change.  \"That is why we are investing record amounts in flood defences, developing a long-term plan for the environment and reviewing planning legislation so new construction projects are sustainable and resilient.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin  Warming unlikely to limit wet summers Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent New research suggests that power companies are dragging their feet when it comes to embracing green energy sources such as wind and solar.  Only one in 10 energy suppliers globally has prioritised renewables over fossil fuels, the study finds.  Even those that are spending on greener energy are continuing to invest in carbon heavy coal and natural gas. The lead researcher says the slow uptake undermines global efforts to tackle climate change. In countries like the UK and across Europe, renewable energy has taken a significant share of the market, with 40% of Britain's electricity coming from wind and solar last year.  But while green energy has boomed around the world in recent years, many of the new wind and solar power installations have been built by independent producers. Large scale utility companies, including many state and city owned enterprises, have been much slower to go green,  according to this new study . The research looked at more than 3,000 electricity companies worldwide and used machine learning techniques to analyse their activities over the past two decades. The study found that only 10% of the companies had expanded their renewable-based power generation more quickly than their gas or coal fired capacity.  Of this small proportion that spent more on renewables, many continued to invest in fossil fuels, although at a lower rate.  The vast majority of companies, according to the author, have just sat on the fence. \"If you look at all utilities, and what's the dominant behaviour, it is that they're not doing much in fossil fuels and renewables,\" said Galina Alova, from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford.  \"So they might be doing something with other fuels like hydro power or nuclear, but they're not transitioning to renewables nor growing the fossil fuel capacity.\" The author says that many of these types of utilities are government-owned and may have invested in their power portfolios many years ago. The overall conclusion from the analysis, though, is that utility companies are \"hindering\" the global transition to renewables. \"Companies are still growing their fossil-fuel based capacity,\" Galina Alova told BBC News.  \"So utilities are still dominating the global fossil fuel business. And I'm also finding that quite a significant share of the fossil-fuel based capacity owned by utilities has been added in the last decade, meaning that these are quite new assets. \"But in order for us to achieve the Paris climate agreement goals, they either need to be retired early, or will need carbon capture and storage because otherwise they're still here to stay for decades.\" She says that inertia within the electricity industry is one key cause of the slow transition.  But the news reporting about energy companies doesn't always capture the complexity of their investments.  \"Renewables and natural gas often go hand in hand,\" said Galina Alova. \"Companies often choose both in parallel. So it might be just in media reports we are getting this image of investing in renewables, but less coverage on continued investment in gas. \"So it's not greenwashing. It is just that this parallel investment in gas dilutes the shift to renewables. That's the key issue.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Energy. Follow Matt  on Twitter. .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Temperature data for 2016 shows it is likely to have edged ahead of 2015 as the world's warmest year. Data from Nasa and the UK Met Office shows temperatures were about 0.07 degrees Celsius above the 2015 mark. Although the Met Office increase was within the margin of error, Nasa says that 2016 was the third year in a row to break the record. The El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon played a role, say scientists, but the main factor was human emissions of CO2. The latest conclusions won't come as a much of a shock to observers, as the likely outcome was  trailed heavily towards the end of last year .  Animation: Climate change explained in six graphics What is climate change? So warm was the early part of 2016 - influenced by a powerful El Ni\u00f1o - that some leading climate scientists were predicting  as early as May that a new record was probable . During an El Ni\u00f1o, a band of unusually warm ocean water develops in parts of the Pacific. The phenomenon affects the climate globally, disrupting weather patterns. This video can not be played According to Nasa figures, 2016 is now the warmest year in a record that dates back to 1880.  \"2015 has been the warmest year on record up until now, so 2016 has just beaten that and and it's beaten that by about 0.1-0.12 of a degree Celsius, which doesn't seem like a lot, but in terms of the year-to-year variations it's actually huge,\" Dr Gavin Schmidt from Nasa told BBC News.  \"This is a very clear record that we're seeing. It is driven mainly by changes in the tropical Pacific where we had an El Ni\u00f1o event that produced a lot of warmth. But we've also seen long-term trends in warming mostly due to the increasing greenhouse gases.\" Another factor that has affected temperatures in 2016 is the unusual warmth in the Arctic.  The sea-ice covering the Arctic  reached its second lowest level  (in terms of extent) in September 2016. The sea-ice grows in autumn and winter and shrinks each spring and summer. While the sea-ice extent last year didn't break the record, the mercury stayed high and the smaller amount of ice now present in the region is at unprecedented levels for the time of year.  A number of meteorological agencies from around the world all released their figures on Wednesday. They all suggest that warming in 2016 was a record that had an important contribution from El Ni\u00f1o.  The Met Office says it contributed about 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. However, researchers believe that while this is substantial, it is not the whole story. \"We understand the contribution El Ni\u00f1o makes fairly well and we've seen it many times,\" said Prof Ellie Highwood from the University of Reading. \"But even if you take that contribution away, we would expect 2015 and 2016 to still be the warmest years we've seen, so a majority of it is coming from global warming and the greenhouse effect.\" The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which pulls together temperature data from a number of sources, agrees that 2016 broke the record by 0.07C.  Not all of the reports on temperature data in 2016 are clear that the warmest-year record has been broken.  The Met Office says that 2016 was 0.77 above the long-term rate, but with a plus or minus error margin of 0.1C, meaning that last year was at the very least, one of the two warmest years on record.  \"The final figures confirm that 2016 was yet another extremely warm year,\" said Peter Stott from the Met Office.  \"The temperature for last year was very close to the year before, temperatures for 2016 exceeding those for 2015 by a small margin.\" Regardless of the small margins, when the new data on 2016 is included, 15 of the warmest 16 years on record have now occurred since 2001.  According to Noaa (the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the only year from the 20th Century to break into the top 16 is 1998, and which ranks seventh warmest.  This prolonged period of warming was having significant impacts around the world.  \"We have also broken sea-ice minimum records in the Arctic and Antarctic,\" said Petteri Taalas from the WMO. \"The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. The persistent loss of sea-ice is driving weather, climate and ocean circulation patterns in other parts of the world. We also have to pay attention to the potential release of methane from melting permafrost,\" he said. Of great concern to scientists and politicians is the fact that the newly published temperature data shows the Earth is once again more than one degree warmer than pre-industrial times, and edging closer to the threshold of 1.5C set under the Paris climate pact.  With the Trump administration about to take office in the US, there are concerns that political support for climate action might fade. This would be a big mistake according to scientists.  \"Climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st Century and shows no signs of slowing down,\" said Prof Mark Maslin, from University College London. \"The decarbonisation of the global economy is the ultimate goal to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The hottest year on record is such a clear warning siren that even President-elect Trump cannot ignore it.\" Researchers say that 2017 is unlikely to break the warming record but will be in the top five hottest years.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns. \"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,\" the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report says  climate change is \"presenting growing challenges  to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth\". The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week,  Donald Trump tweeted, \"whatever happened to global warming?\" Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the US, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic. This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida. And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was \"largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population\". The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. \"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,\" the report says. \"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.\" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \"to adapt to the changes that will occur\". Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not \"some problem in the distant future\". \"It's happening right now in every part of the country,\" she said. That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice. \"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,\" she said. Former US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season. \"Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,\" Mr Gore said. \"The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.\" In October,  President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a \"political agenda\" , telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was \"a hoax\". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: \"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.\" A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

{"id":null,"body":"By Robbie Meredith BBC News NI Education Correspondent Pupils entering Year 12 who are taking a GCSE in English literature will not have to study any novels as part of their course. It is among changes proposed by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). Pupils taking GCSE, AS and A-level courses will have their grades decided by exams again in 2021. However, pupils taking GCSEs are to sit fewer exams and what they have to study on many courses will be cut. Exams were cancelled in 2020 and pupils received GCSE, AS and A-level grades  calculated by their schools instead . That came after controversy over the original method of awarding pupils their grades  partly based on standardisation by CCEA . CCEA has published proposals to reduce what has to be taught in many GCSE subjects in the 2020\/21 school year but has said public exams should take place again next summer. \"It would mean all students, regardless of their GCSE subject choices, can benefit from a reduction in the number of examinations they are required to take in summer 2021,\" CCEA said. In some GCSEs, units that represent up to 40% of a course will be cut. In GCSE English literature, for example, a unit on the study of prose will be dropped. Pupils would previously have chosen one novel to study from a range of seven, including Lord of the Flies, To Kill a Mockingbird, Animal Farm and Of Mice and Men. However, their GCSE will now consist only of the study of poetry, drama and Shakespeare instead. In history, a unit on international relations between 1945 and 2003 will be dropped. CCEA has published details of elements of courses to be cut in 28 GCSEs in all. However, GCSE courses in English language and maths - which are regarded as core qualifications - are among those that will not be changed. The proposed changes will only apply for pupils who are entering the second year of their GCSE course and due to sit exams in summer 2021. Pupils taking AS and A-level courses will also be assessed using exams but what they are expected to study in their subjects will not be affected by cuts. Pupils entering Year 14 and taking A-levels through CCEA will have their entire result based on exams in 2021. \"We are not proposing further reductions in either AS or A2 content at this time,\" CCEA said. \"The reason for this is that these young people have not, to date, missed teaching time in these courses. \"We would like to provide the opportunity for them to engage with the full course content and to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to facilitate progression to higher education.\" Speaking on Tuesday morning, Alliance leader Naomi Long said it was not something she had an opinion on as justice minister, but that she believed that \"the love of reading is what drives education\". \"In this year when we've all been restricted in terms of where we can travel and where we can go, you can open a travel book and read about places that this year we can never go,\" she said. \"Books open a window on the world and I just think the more we get young people engaged in reading the easier it will be for young people to be engaged in education throughout their lives.\" Belfast author Glenn Patterson said he had sympathy with the both the exam board and schools.  \"I can't help but think that however temporary this is, it is a significant loss for the pupils who are affected,\" he said.   \"It is in the name, novel, they give you a new way, a new angle of coming at the world.  CCEA said any further reduction to AS and A level content would be kept under review in case there was further disruption to schools due to coronavirus. CCEA said that they were proposing \"practical and common sense changes that are a necessity in the current public health climate\". They also said they wanted to \"reduce the burden of assessment on students in summer 2021 and support student wellbeing\". However, the exams board added it was preparing for other contingencies in case there was further disruption to schools. \"There is further work being taken forward to consider contingency arrangements to deal with a range of potential public health scenarios, including local lockdowns,\" CCEA said. \"Above all, we realise there will be a need to be flexible and that arrangements may need to evolve and change as the academic year continues.\" As a result, the exams period in summer 2021 may be shorter but would still end on 30 June. CCEA is consulting on its proposed changes and has asked for feedback by Monday, 7 September 2020. \"We fully recognise the urgent need for clarity for both teachers and students, and to support this the consultation will be open for two weeks,\" CCEA said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The rich are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, a study by the University of Leeds of 86 countries claims. The wealthiest tenth of people consume about 20 times more energy overall than the bottom ten, wherever they live. The gulf is greatest in transport, where the top tenth gobble 187 times more fuel than the poorest tenth, the research says. That\u2019s because people on the lowest incomes can rarely afford to drive. The researchers found that the richer people became, the more energy they typically use. And it was replicated across all countries.  And they warn that, unless there's a significant policy change, household energy consumption could double from 2011 levels by 2050. That's even if energy efficiency improves. Transport gulf The researchers combined European Union and World Bank data to calculate how different income groups spend their money. They say it\u2019s the first study of its kind. It found that  in transport the richest tenth of consumers use more than half the energy. This reflects previous research showing that 15% of UK travellers take 70% of all flights. The ultra-rich fly by far furthest, while 57% of the UK population does not fly abroad at all. The study, published in Nature Energy, showed that energy for cooking and heating is more equitably consumed.  But even then, the top 10% of consumers used roughly one third of the total, presumably reflecting the size of their homes. Solutions? Co-author Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the  project at Leeds, asked: \u201cHow can we change the vastly unequal distribution of energy to provide a decent life for everyone while protecting the climate and ecosystems?\u201d The authors say governments could reduce transport demand through better public transport, higher taxes on bigger vehicles and frequent flyer levies for people who take most holidays. They say another alternative is to electrify vehicles more quickly, although previous studies suggest even then demand for driving must be reduced in order to reduce the strain on resource use and electricity production and distribution. Rich Brits The research also examined the relative energy consumption of one nation against another. It shows that a fifth of UK citizens are in the top 5% of global energy consumers, along with 40% of German citizens, and Luxembourg\u2019s entire population. Only 2% of Chinese people are in the top global 5% of users, and just 0.02% of people in India. Even the poorest fifth of Britons consumes over five times as much energy per person as the bottom billion in India. The study is likely to ignite future UN climate negotiations, where the issue of equity is always bitterly contentious.  In the USA, libertarian politicians have typically portrayed climate change as a harbinger of global socialism. Normal lives? But Professor Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News: \u201cThis study tells relatively wealthy people like us what we don\u2019t want to hear. \u201cThe climate issue is framed by us high emitters \u2013 the politicians, business people, journalists, academics. When we say there\u2019s no appetite for higher taxes on flying, we mean WE don\u2019t want to fly less \u201cThe same is true about our cars and the size our homes. We have convinced ourselves that our lives are normal, yet the numbers tell a very different story,\u201d he said. The study says transport energy alone could increase 31% by 2050. \u201cIf transport continues to rely on fossil fuels, this increase would be disastrous for the climate,\u201d the report says. It suggests different remedies for different types of energy use. So, flying and driving big cars could face higher taxes, while energy from homes could be reduced by a housing retrofit. The authors note that the recent Budget declined to increase fuel duty and promised 4,000 miles of new roads. It did not mention home insulation. The Treasury was contacted to discuss the taxation issues raised in the research, but declined to comment.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Technologies that can remove carbon dioxide from the air could have huge implications for future food prices, according to new research. Scientists say that machines that remove CO2 from the air will be needed to keep the rise in global temperatures in check. But these devices will have major impacts on energy, water and land use. By 2050,  according to this new report , food crop prices could rise more than five-fold in some parts of the world.  In the wake of the Paris climate agreement signed in 2015, researchers have tried to understand what keeping the world under a 1.5C temperature threshold would mean in practice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  reported on this question in 2018 , and found that keeping below this temperature rise would require the world to reach net zero emissions by 2050 but would also need the removal and storage of large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. One of the ideas on how to achieve this is called BECCS - bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. It means growing crops that soak up CO2, then burning them for electricity while capturing and burying the carbon that's produced.  Critics say this idea would need the deployment of huge amounts of land which would reduce the amount of land for agriculture at a time of increasing global population. Another technology that has raised much interest is called Direct Air Capture (DAC), where machines pull CO2 directly from the atmosphere. A number of experimental installations of this idea have been successfully implemented, notably in  Switzerland  and  Canada . But there has been little research to date on how the deployment of DAC would impact crop and food prices.  This new study looks at the large-scale deployment of a range of negative emissions technologies including DAC. The report says that the energy and water resources needed to drive these machines will be on a very large scale. DAC will need large amounts of heat to make the process work, say the authors. This would require energy equal to 115% of current global natural gas consumption. Water for DAC is also a significant cost by 2050, with the machines using 35% of the water currently used in global electricity production. And while DAC reduces the amount of land required, there will still be a need for significant amounts of energy crops and new forests. \"I want to make clear that we're not in any way trying to throw cold water on efforts to try and develop DAC,\" says Dr Andres Clarens from the University of Virginia, who led the study. \"I think DAC is really very important technology that needs to be developed.\" \"But in our simulations, what we find is that the world doesn't just go 100% all in on DAC, right?  \"Even under optimistic pricing scenarios for the technology, the world is still deploying a decent amount of BECCs, if you want to get to 1.5C.  \"DAC is not going to be the only thing.\" According to the report, with widespread use of DAC, many parts of the world will see substantial price increases in maize, wheat and rice.  The worst affected areas would be in sub-Saharan Africa which could see prices rise by 5-600% by 2050. India, Pakistan and many other countries in Asia could see three to five-fold increases, while Europe and South America could see prices double or treble. But some people involved in DAC reject the report's findings, saying that the authors wrongly assumed that all air capture systems are the same.  \"We would like to point out that the paper only analysed liquid sorbent direct air capture technology whilst Climeworks has developed a solid sorbent technology that does not rely on the burning of natural gas or has a need for fresh water to deliver carbon dioxide removal from the air,\" said Christoph Beuttler from Climeworks. \"We are confident that if the paper would have made that distinction the reported direct air capture potentials could be significantly higher and the risks lower.\" Despite the questions over methods, all involved in negative emissions agree that the longer it takes to implement these technologies, the bigger the impact on food, energy and water.  Short-term efforts to decarbonise, particularly in transport and energy production will alleviate some of the difficulties with negative emissions. \"I think that negative emissions are going to be important. I think that DAC in particular is going to be important. But I think that it can't be our first order of business. We have to get off fossil fuels as soon as possible,\" said Andres Clarens. \"Anybody that thinks we can continue to burn fossil fuels for another decade, because we'll just do DAC, you know, down the road. That's not a viable approach.\" The  study has been published  in Nature Climate Change.  Follow Matt  on Twitter. .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice Negotiators in Poland have finally secured agreement on a range of measures that will make the Paris climate pact operational in 2020. Last-minute rows over carbon markets threatened to derail the two-week summit - and delayed it by a day. Delegates believe the new rules will ensure that countries keep their promises to cut carbon. The Katowice agreement aims to deliver the Paris goals of limiting global temperature rises to well below 2C.   \"Putting together the Paris agreement work programme is a big responsibility,\" said the chairman of the talks, known as COP24, Michal Kurtyka. \"It has been a long road. We did our best to leave no-one behind.\" This video can not be played The summit accord, reached by 196 states, outlines  plans for a common rulebook for all countries  - regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. Sorting out the rulebook  sounds easy but is very technical. Countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. Poorer countries want some \"flexibility\" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice.  \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. A deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the rules for the monitoring of carbon credits threatened to derail the talks. Brazil had been pushing for a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, despite strong opposition from many other countries. These discussions have now been deferred until next year.  Further tensions emerged last weekend, scientists and delegates were shocked when the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait  objected to the meeting \"welcoming\" a recent UN report  on keeping global temperature rise to within the 1.5C limit. The report said the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century. In a compromise, the final statement from the summit welcomed the \"completion\" of the report and invited countries to make use of it. Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement, and now with the European Climate Foundation, said the agreement was a big boost for the Paris pact.  \"The key piece was having a good transparency system because it builds trust between countries and because we can measure what is being done and it is precise enough,\" she told BBC News on the sidelines of this meeting. This video can not be played \"I am happy with that. Nobody can say that's not clear, we don't know what to do, or that it's not true anymore. It's very clear,\" She said that countries like Russia- which had refused to ratify the Paris agreement because it wasn't sure about the rules - could no longer use that excuse.  However some observers say the deal is not sufficiently strong to deal with the urgency of the climate problem. In the words of one delegate, \"it's what's possible, but not what's necessary\". There has been a big push for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency.  Many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as \"grossly insufficient\" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. Business is also looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. \"Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,\" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. \"So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster.\" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What's your diet's carbon footprint?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Rising temperatures may be having a profound physical impact on one of the world's favourite songbirds.  Researchers in Spain  found  that over a 20-year period, nightingales had evolved smaller wingspans.  The scientists say this is linked to a changing climate in the region which has seen the early onset of spring and increased drought.  They are concerned that this could affect the bird's ability to migrate in winter.  Famed for its ability to sing, the nightingale has a very rich repertoire as it is able to produce over 1,000 different sounds, compared to just 340 by skylarks.  Although common in many parts of Europe and Asia, the bird is mainly seen and heard in southern England. Numbers here have declined markedly over the last half century, down 90%, with multiple factors to blame including deer eating their preferred nesting sites, but also because of a changing climate. The nightingale spends the winter in sub-Saharan Africa, with the small, brown creature clocking up huge distances during migration. Wing size is critical to this endeavour. Now,, researchers say that ability to migrate may be impeded by climate change.  Scientists in Spain have studied 20 years of data on wing shape in two populations of the birds. They found that the average wing length of the nightingales relative to their body size has decreased.  They believe this is related to changes in temperatures seen in the Mediterranean region. \"Our results show that spring is delayed and the intensity of the summer drought is higher, which means a shorter optimal breeding period for the birds,\" said Dr Carolina Remacha, from Madrid's Complutense University, who led the study. \"We find the unique possibility that shorter wings are being favoured.\" The researchers believe that birds like the nightingale normally adapt to the demands of migration by having longer wings, having a larger clutch size but a shorter lifespan.  However, the changing temperatures are interfering with this and provoking a response from the birds.  Faced with a shorter breeding season, the researchers believe the most successful birds are having smaller families with smaller wings.  They argue that these adaptations are likely to come at a price. \"If these changes are the response to the new environment, then obviously the ones that have been selected, the ones with shorter wings, are the optimal nightingales for the new situation,\" said co-author Prof Javier Perez-Tris also from Complutense University. \"These are not the best wings for migration, but the shorter wings come in the same package.\" The researchers say that the birds are continuing with the same migration patterns and destinations and therefore their survival is likely to be reduced.  While the scientists say this \"maladaptation\" is evident in the birds they have studied in Spain where there have been droughts in the summer, it may also be impacting other members of the species in different regions. \"If the climate is changing in a similar way, and the pressures are similar than you'd expect similar responses,\" said Dr Perez-Tris.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent While the rest of the world has cut coal-based electricity over the past 18 months, China has added enough to power 31 million homes. That's according to a  study  that says China is now in the process of building or reviving coal equivalent to the EU's entire generating capacity.  China is also financing around a quarter of all proposed coal plants outside its borders.  Researchers say the surge is a major threat to the Paris climate targets. China's reliance on coal as a key step in developing the economy led to the fabled \"one coal plant a week\" building programme between 2006 and 2015. But the push had many negative consequences, choking the air with pollution in many Chinese cities and leading to huge overcapacity. Many of these plants were only able to run 50% of the time. In 2015, in an attempt to curb the growth, the national government tried to clamp down on new-build coal. However, it continued to allow provincial governments the freedom to issue permits for new coal plants. That move misfired badly.  Local authorities subsequently permitted up to five times more plants than in any comparable period. According to Ted Nace, from coal researchers Global Energy Monitor, it was like a \"snake swallowing a goat\". \"This goat that the snake swallowed is still moving through the snake, and it's coming out in the form of another 20% in the Chinese coal fleet on top of a fleet that was already over-built,\" Mr Nace added.  The researchers say that through 2018 and up to June 2019, countries outside of China cut their coal power capacity by 8.1 gigawatts (GW). In the same period, China added 43GW, enough to power around 31 million homes.  The authors say that right now the amount of coal power under construction or under suspension and likely to be revived is about 147.7GW, an amount that is almost the same as the entire coal generating capacity of the European Union (150GW).   Compared to the rest of the world, China is building about 50% more coal plants than are under construction in all other countries combined. The country is on track to top 1,100GW of coal by 2020.  The Chinese government has signalled that it wants to rely less on coal for the country's energy production and is making some headway cutting coal's share of total energy from 68% in 2012 to 59% in 2018. However, despite the share going down, absolute coal consumption has gone up in line with overall energy demand.  What concerns the researchers is that within China, coal and electricity industry groups are pushing for an even bigger increase in the country's overall coal power capacity. \"The thing we are super worried about is that industry has actually organised to keep the whole thing going,\" said Ted Nace. \"There are three different powerful trade groups, proposing to increase the coal fleet by 40%. This is sheer madness at this point.\"  China is also busy financing coal development outside the country, funding over a quarter of all the coal plants outside its borders in countries like South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Observers outside of China say they are concerned that by building or permitting these plants, the authorities are locking in a form of power generation that just doesn't make sense economically.  \"The economics will not be borne out,\" said Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \"I would argue that almost all this new capacity that's being added will never make the economic return on which they have been premised. Those assets that are coming online now will have to be written down; they will be stranded assets essentially.\"  The bigger question is how this new coal will affect the ability of the world to meet the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement.  The researchers say that by 2030, China needs to reduce its coal power capacity by over 40% from current levels in order to meet the reductions required to hold global warming well below 2C. \"China's proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris Agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach, even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet,\" said co-author Christine Shearer of Global Energy Monitor.  \"Instead of expanding further, China needs to make significant reductions to its coal fleet over the coming decade.\" Global Energy Monitor was originally known as Coal Swarm and has received funding from environmental groups, including the ClimateWorks Foundation, the Rockefeller Family fund, the US National Resources Defence Council, the European Climate Foundation, among others.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Road planners in England have been accused of rigging accounting rules to disguise the climate impact of new roads. Environmentalists say the Department for Transport has under-counted CO2 from its road improvement programme.  That's because the DfT measures emissions against national CO2 targets, whilst measuring benefits of a new road against the local economy. A Treasury spokesperson said this was a reasonable approach.  But critics say the resulting calculation exaggerates the benefits of new roads, whilst downgrading the negatives in terms of carbon emissions.  Chris Todd, director of pressure group Transport Action Network, told the BBC it proved the government has one rule for its \u00a327bn  road-building programme , and another rule for everything else. He said: \u201cThis is like someone who's morbidly obese insisting they can gorge on another cream cake, because no single cake will have a 'material impact' on their well-being.\u201d The Treasury strongly rejects the allegation.  A spokesperson said it made sense to measure the carbon emissions from new roads against the UK\u2019s entire carbon budget, because climate change is a global problem, whereas smaller road schemes offer local benefits.  But the objectors are motivated by a recent analysis from transport academic Phil Goodwin, an emeritus professor at University College London.  He says the DfT should employ the same standard for measuring the negatives of the roads programme as it uses to measure the positives.  \u201cConsider,\u201d he says, \u201cif one calculated the total number of jobs generated by a specific scheme as a proportion of the total jobs in the economy.\" \u201cAny such calculation will always be open to words like \u2018immaterial\u2019 or \u2018insignificant' - but this does not in the slightest prove that the aggregate effect really is unimportant.\u201d Prof Goodwin said the appraisal system made CO2 \u201cuniquely unimportant\u201d.  A  recent consultants\u2019 report  projected that the government\u2019s roads programme will increase carbon emissions from the strategic road network by about 20 MtCO2, when they need to go down by about 167 MtCO2 to meet carbon targets. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe reject this. The report is based on old project appraisals, and takes no account of our ambitious plans to decarbonise transport.  \u201cWe have assessed carbon impacts throughout the design of the roads programme using much more accurate methods, and expect the impact of new improvements to be around 0.27 million tonnes through to the end of 2032.\u201d But Prof Goodwin said the roads programme was still predicated on increased traffic, even though Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says we  should be driving less . The government argues that the advent of electric cars will solve the CO2 problem on the roads.  But its critics predict that the switch to 100% electric cars will come too late to meet CO2 targets. They also warn that battery cars take a huge toll on resources.

{"id":null,"body":"By Catherine Byaruhanga and Louise Adamou BBC News, Seychelles On board Darryl Green's small fishing boat, just off the island of Praslin in the Seychelles, the water is so clear we can see the seabed. Brightly coloured fish swim around the hull.  \"You know at my age I've seen the fish size decrease dramatically,\" the fisherman reminisces. He's on board his boat with his young grandson in tow.  \"If as fishermen, we do not take responsibility for our fish stocks, who's going to do it? If we don't start somewhere then in the future we're going to be very hard pushed to find fish to feed our children.\" Mr Green has been fishing his local bay for decades - but not any more. He's set up a project with his fellow fishermen to voluntarily stop fishing here for six months of the year, hoping that this will allow fish stocks to replenish.  \"This is our office,\" he says. \"You go to the office to work. We come here to work. This is where we earn our livelihood. So we've got to protect it.\"  During the six months off, they have to fish further out to sea, while some of them do other things like carpentry too.  Mr Green's project is one of many which have been funded by a pioneering marine conservation plan.  In the first deal of its kind, the East African nation swapped 5% of its national debt for a cash injection to fight the effects of climate change on the ocean.   In return, it promised to protect 30% of its national waters, which is an area twice the size of the UK - by the end of next year. It's a huge undertaking for this tiny nation.  The Seychelles government agreed the debt swap with the Nature Conservancy, a US charity, and a number of investors in 2016. Under the terms of the $21m (\u00a316m) deal, the charity and the investors - who include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation - bought a portion of the Seychelles' national debt from European nations, such as the UK and France.   The debt is now held by a trust, the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT), which offers the country lower interest rates on its repayments.  The savings - over $8 million - are ring-fenced for projects designed to protect marine life and handle the effects of climate change.  Small island nations are among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels. Conservationists say dying coral reefs, extreme weather and land erosion threaten the very existence of the Seychelles archipelago.  The country is trying to defend its greatest resource - the sea - but it's no easy task. All human activity in the protected areas will have to be severely restricted - not just fishing but tourism too. Policing this huge swathe of the Indian Ocean will fall to the country's coastguard. Lt Col Connie Anthony says it will take her team two days to get to some of the waters they are charged with protecting. \"We don't have a big coastguard. What we are doing now in order for us to get ready is mostly on our outer islands, that are further away. We've put soldiers on those islands and they have vessels with them to conduct inner harbour patrols.\" she says. Thankfully they will have assistance from the skies. The country's air force is on board with the plans and will be using their unique vantage point to support their colleagues below. Captain Donn Du Preez explains how they will spot rogue vessels. \"From the aircraft, we can see what we call trip wires, which are things that give us clues whether they are legal or not. For example, are they flying a flag? Not flying a flag? What type equipment could they have on board a vessel? Have they got buoys in the water? That sort of thing.\" He says they are more than ready for the challenge.  \"Our aircraft are quite capable. We have quite sophisticated equipment on board and we can detect vessels from quite long distances away. And when we fly, we cover tens of thousands of square kilometres. And we do that quite effectively, so we can do the job.\"  Other countries are also negotiating similar deals with the The Nature Conservancy to protect their oceans.  Wallace Cosgrow, the Seychelles' environment minister, says his country can hold up its end of the deal. \"We want to lead by example and show the world that it can be done. The resources in small island countries are not always available for conservation for example. So we're looking at innovative ways to raise financing to support the environment. \"I get a lot of questions, especially from small island states where they also want to replicate the debt swap but also looking at marine spatial planning.\" While most people on the islands are positive, there is no denying that in a country which relies on its oceans for income, it won't be easy balancing the demands of people's livelihoods and what's best for the environment. On the main island of Mahe, Beatty Hoarau, another fisherman has concerns. He operates bigger commercial operations and his boats can be out at sea for days at a time.  \"I think having a protected area is good, but what has happened now is simply to me a publicity stunt. We have, like you say, to make sacrifices - but sacrifices should not come only from the fishermen,\" he says.  Back on Praslin Island, fisherman Mr Green tells us about another challenge he's facing - this one from his little grandson.  \"He tells me: 'When I grow up, I'm going to be a fisherman. I don't want to go to school,'\" Mr Green says. \"I tell him: 'No, no, no! I think you should go to school first to learn, because there are lots of instruments you have to know how to use.  And then you will go fishing!'\" \"He seems to have a real passion for it and he's very good - but then he's had a good teacher,\" laughs Mr Green.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is \"Build Back Better\", but can they succeed?  I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change. That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly. Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown. The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally. Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living.  Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience.  Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix. But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown. In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said  they would work more from home in future.  This has implications for the UK government's \u00a328bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely. The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away. This video can not be played The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its \u00a328bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadband Another likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to  turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists.  This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of \"corona cycle-ways\", and Milan, which has a  programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists. The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector. The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is \"Build Back Better\". But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus.  They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels. For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband. This video can not be played Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries.  All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists. But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have \"far-reaching\" economic and social consequences. They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions.  That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions. In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet. MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the \"greenest\" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry.  They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost. But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees. Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: \"Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself. \"It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.\" That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up? Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by  drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world. The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price.  But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis? Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state. \"The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,\" he said. \"But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon.  \"So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.\" At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change.  In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future. The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a \"Green New Deal\" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way. He tweeted:   Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement.  Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants. The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was  more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW). That doesn't take into account China's estimated  $1 trillion investment in its \"Belt and Road\" initiative  to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries. Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery. And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects. He tells me: \"If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.\" Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales Environment Correspondent Some of Wales' biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have been urged to join together to help tackle climate change. More than 300 businesses, public sector bodies and community leaders are meeting at a conference in Cardiff. Extinction Rebellion campaigners have also been invited by the Welsh Government to share their ideas. Environment minister Lesley Griffiths said she hoped for a \"collective response\" to cut emissions. Wales is set to put a new target into law next year for a  95% reduction in greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by 2050. It follows advice by experts at the Committee on Climate Change, who said it would be an appropriate contribution to the UK hitting a so-called net zero target by the same year. Net zero means effectively eliminating greenhouse gases from our economy and way of life - not pumping out any more than we can absorb back from the atmosphere through trees or new technologies. But Ms Griffiths cast doubt on the feasibility of calls from within her own party for swifter action. Speaking to reporters ahead of the conference she was asked about a motion passed at the UK Labour party conference, backing a net zero target by 2030. \"I personally at the moment don't think it is (doable),\" she said. \"The UK Committee on Climate Change are telling me that Wales can't even do it by 2050, at the current time - and that's why were set a target of 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.\" \"However we've said that we have the ambition to be net zero.\" This video can not be played The inaugural Climate Change Conference is being hosted by the Welsh Government' after it declared a climate emergency in April. It is set to become an annual event. Ministers say it will help inform Wales' response to future UN summits on global warming and \"an ambitious All Wales Delivery Plan in 2021\". Great  @fmwales  opening the  #lowcarbonwales  event. Key message: we need to 'begin somewhere' have to 'start somewhere', 'small makes a difference'.  However, I feel this is wrong message. The scale\/pace of change we face is huge! This truth needs to be told  #ClimateEmergency   pic.twitter.com\/3wni0mDfTw But business leaders said companies needed more support and advice on the issue. Ben Francis, policy chairman of the Federation of Small Business in Wales, said small firms were taking really innovative steps to reduce their carbon impact - from donating off-cut fabrics to colleges to giving staff reusable drinks bottles to cut down on single-use plastics.  But he said businesses also needed advice and guidance on where to go when making big decisions on environmental issues, such as buying a vehicle or looking for premises. \"Having declared a 'climate crisis' governments now need to engage business to explain what will be done differently as a result of that in a conversation which not just about obligation but also opportunity for businesses and the wider Welsh economy,\" he added. Deeside-based supermarket chain Iceland agreed there could be more advice, with carrots as well as sticks - including tax breaks for innovation around food waste. It said as well as eliminating palm oil from the shelves it had a pledge to eliminate plastic from its own label packaging by 2023 - and wants other retailers to follows its lead. \"Ultimately our customers are telling us they want us to do these things,\" said managing director Richard Walker. \"Eighty per cent of them said we should lead on these activities but we're also looking at reducing our carbon and food waste.\" As well as attending the conference, Extinction Rebellion activists intend to stage a demonstration outside it. During the day extreme endurance athlete and former Welsh rugby player Richard Parks will be announced as a climate change ambassador. He said he was excited to be working with the Welsh Government in the run up to the UN COP 26 summit on climate change in Glasgow next year. \"From Antarctica to here in Wales, I have undertaken expeditions across the globe,\" he said. \"Having experienced first-hand the impact climate change is having on our world, now is a critical time to protect our planet for our children.\" When asked on BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast with Claire Summers what changes he had made to help the environment, he said: \"It's a number of things. The decision that we make about where we shop, around the clothes that I purchase, the choices I make around recyclable containers.  \"These all might seem obvious and trivial but they're a way we can all become part of the solution and we can all become accountable.  \"One of the things my family and I have done over the last few years is make a conscious decision not to use the car on weekends. Sometimes we have to, we all lead normal lives\u2026 I've made a conscious decision in the last five to 10 years to use public transport.\"  Si\u00e2n Stephen, of Extinction Rebellion said: \"We're delighted that the government has taken the move to hold this conference, bringing together the business sector and third sector to discuss ways of decarbonising.\" What is climate change doing to Wales?

{"id":null,"body":"Idris Elba and his wife, Sabrina Dhowre Elba, have said individuals can make a difference in tackling climate change.  The couple were speaking to Liz Bonnin for BBC Radio 5 Live's new podcast  'What Planet Are We On? ' Actor, producer and DJ, Idris said: \"There is definitely something that we can all do. You are doing it now listening to this. There is hope.\" Sabrina, who is a model and actress, added: \"There is a method, there are steps.  \"It isn't just throw your hands in the air and go 'the world is on fire'. \"There are solutions and it's figuring out what those solutions are and how we can each play a part because we do know that every person can make a difference.   \"It is so easy to feel hopeless when you do hear all of that scaremongering but people can make a change. Each individual person.\" Climate change is often seen as a problem that's so big, it needs to be tackled at the level of world governments. But the couple say every person can play a role. The 10-part podcast explores issues and solutions around climate change. The couple feature in an episode which looks at the impact of climate change on our global food systems.  This video can not be played Idris said he wanted to use his platform to \"shine a light\" on those most affected by global warming. \"There's no shortage of voices talking about climate change and the green debate,\" he said, \"but there's not much visibility on the people that haven't much at all and still suffer climate change. \"We look at small farmers as slightly unrelated to us, somewhere in the Sahara, but that food chain links to all of us. \"The effect is not apparent now, but it will be massively.\" Sabrina and Idris are ambassadors for the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).  Some of IFAD's projects aim to make food production more resilient to the impacts of climate change. They are piloting climate adaption technologies such as rainwater harvesting and supplementary irrigation. Sabrina said she and Idris had a strong passion for taking care of the planet for the coming generations.  \"We've just got married. I want to have children one day and bring them into a world which I don't think will be destroyed in the coming years,\" she said. That sense of responsibility has led them to look for programmes which help people in Africa who are affected by climate change. Last year, they went to Sierra Leone to meet farmers affected by the Ebola epidemic. \"These farmers are probably the least contributors to the climate change problem but are yet being affected the most,\" said Sabrina.  \"This demand, which we saw go up with the pandemic, has always been an almost unreal demand. Food waste is no secret issue in the West and in the North\". Speaking of how he would like to see the world change, Idris said: \"My son is six years old and I want him to know Daddy went to Sierra Leone to look at agriculture. 'What's agriculture, Daddy?' Well it's a way of growing food. It's a way of looking after our world. And if we look after our world, it will supply us back.  \"And that is something we should leave with the next generation. Even if it's just not that everyone is going to be a great farmer but it's the understanding of the food chain and food supply. That is really important.\" Exactly how climate change will affect our food security depends on where in the world we are trying to produce food. And it is a problem intertwined with other threats, including an ongoing decline in crop-pollinating insects and the  loss of the fertile soil we need to grow plants and graze livestock .

{"id":null,"body":"Since there is a consensus amongst the majority of the world's scientists that temperatures are rising - most likely driven by human behaviour - why does climate change coverage seem to be drying up?  Have the media lost interest? Is it a question of chronic political fatigue? Are our brains simply not wired to think long-term?  The BBC World Service's  The Inquiry  hears from four expert witnesses.  Max Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago. \"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month. \"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively. \"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the  UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen ]. \"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK. \"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter.  \"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\" Jennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute. \"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years. \"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'. \"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan: \"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\" China's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up.  \"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it.  \"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained.  \"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this.   \"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\" Environmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act.  \"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away.  \"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is. \"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\" We also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:   \"'What can I do about this global problem? I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.' \"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives.  \"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'.  \"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests.  Joe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve. \"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media.  \"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions.   \"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science.   \"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable. \"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission.  \"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that if the world doesn't change course by 2020, we run the risk of runaway climate change.  Mr Guterres said he was alarmed by the paralysis of world leaders on what he called the \"defining issue\" of our time. He wants heads of government to come to New York for a special climate conference next September.  The call comes amid growing concerns over the slow pace of UN negotiations. Mr Guterres painted a grim picture of the impacts of climate change that he says have been felt all over the world this year, with heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods leaving a trail of destruction.  Corals are dying, he said, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and there are growing conflicts over dwindling resources. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are at their highest level in three million years. Despite the fact that the world agreed on a plan to tackle climate change in Paris in 2015, Mr Guterres said the world is way off track to achieve the modest goals of the pact.  Despite the dire situation, the world could still tackle climate change effectively, he said. Saying it was too expensive to do so was \"hogwash\".  \"For every dollar spent restoring degraded forests, as much as $30 can be recouped in economic benefits and poverty reduction,\" Mr Guterres said.  The world has the tools, and the ability. Renewables are cost-competitive with coal and oil, he said. By 2030, wind and solar could power more than a third of Europe.  But the lack of decisive political leadership was hampering everything, he said.  Calling for global leaders to meet with him at a special summit in New York in September next year, Mr Guterres argued this would give the world the push it needs at a critical moment.  It comes just before the countries that have signed the Paris agreement will review and increase their commitments to cut carbon.  Progress on that road is currently stalled. UN negotiators met in Bangkok last week to try and push the process forward. But arguments between rich and poor nations over money have seen tempers rise and ambition decline.  Delegates will meet again in Katowice in Poland in December to try to finalise the rule book for the Paris pact, but the omens are not good.  In his speech Mr Guterres warned that \"we cannot allow Katowice to remind us of Copenhagen,\" referencing the infamous failed meeting in the Danish capital in 2009. Many observers believe that the influence of US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement and his general scepticism towards climate change and multilateralism has soured the atmosphere in the UN talks.  \"The US attempts to slow down this process should come as no surprise,\" said Jesse Bragg from the non-governmental organisation, Corporate Accountability.  \"It has a long history of watering down and undermining multilateral agreements. But, in leading the charge to block practically every discussion on finance for the Paris guidelines, the US administration is threatening the future of the agreement and multilateralism itself.\" Mr Guterres says he is committing himself and the UN to the effort of transforming the political landscape to tame the threat of climate change. He pointed to the forthcoming report from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  on how to keep the world from warming by more that 1.5 degrees C, which he says will be a sobering assessment.  \"We are careering towards the edge of the abyss,\" Mr Guterres said. \"Our fate is in our own hands.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Laura Foster Science and Environment Reporter Scientists from the  University of Manchester  are creating a blueprint to help bands and pop stars to perform live and tour the world without contributing to climate change. It's after the  Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research  were approached by the group Massive Attack who say they want to help find solutions to the climate crisis. The findings will be shared with musicians from across the industry and, it's hoped, will inspire millions of fans to live more sustainably. Massive Attack have spent a lot of 2019 with the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, even playing a set at one of their protests in London in April. Robert del Naja, aka 3D, told the BBC he felt conflicted because of how his career has contributed to climate change.  \"[As musicians] we have enjoyed a high carbon lifestyle. But as a society we've all existed in a fossil fuel economy for a long time and had very little choice in that. \"The challenge now is to not only make personal sacrifices, but to insist on the systemic change that's needed. Business as usual is over.\" The news comes a week after  Coldplay announced they would not tour with their latest album for environmental reasons. This video can not be played Meanwhile, Billie Eilish is offering fans a chance to earn tickets to her next tour by fighting climate change and there'll be eco-villages at each concert where fans can learn more about the issues facing the planet. What will the scientists be looking at? This new research will look at all aspects of touring and how its carbon footprint can be reduced to zero, or as close to zero as possible. It's not looking simply at balancing out emissions from concerts by planting trees for removing carbon dioxide from the air - a process known as carbon offsetting. Instead, researchers will look at how to reduce the amount of energy used during concerts and in moving musicians, crews and sets between different venues and cities, as well as the impact audiences have. Tyndall Manchester's Director, Prof Carly McLachlan, says they'll be looking at where switches can be made to renewable energy sources, how to reduce the amount of energy being consumed but also thinking about how touring could be different. \"It is a high carbon sector and we need to try and tackle that, because every sector has to be part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.\" It's not yet known what impact, if any, changing the way tours are put on will have on ticket prices, routes or number of concerts. Just how bad is live music for the environment? Musicians are often criticised when they speak out about climate change and carbon because they have high carbon lifestyles. Promoting albums and performing in cities around the world means artists and their teams fly a lot. Then there are the carbon emissions from tour buses, from moving sets, from making merchandise, on top of the energy needed for things like lighting and sound. Recent figures  suggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK every year. Prof Carly McLachlan says music and art and culture are a \"really beautiful part of what it is to be human\". \"If this is something we really value in our lives, we need to make sure we can do it in a way that has reduced impact.\" Follow Laura on  twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"Green and Social Democrat (SPD) politicians in Germany say the 7% sales tax (VAT) rate on meat should be raised to 19% to help curb global warming and fund animal welfare improvements. According to UN research, methane from livestock accounts for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions - more than the direct emissions from transport. The German proposal, if made law, could reduce meat purchases and the supply of cheaper meats from factory farms.  But the agriculture minister objected. Minister Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party, said she welcomed the discussion on improving animal welfare, but argued that raising VAT was not the way to do it, as a drop in meat sales could hurt farmers' incomes. The standard VAT rate in Germany is 19%, but most foods, including meat, benefit from the reduced rate of 7%.  The SPD is in government with the CDU, and the German Greens made big gains in the May European elections. The German debate coincided with  a UN report from a panel of scientists calling for a determined switch away from livestock farming . They argue that the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming. This video can not be played Besides the harm caused by methane emissions from livestock, there is the widespread destruction of forests to make way for pasture, a process that releases CO2 stored in soil and reduces the absorption of CO2 by trees. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  says the livestock sector produces 14.5%  of greenhouse gas emissions, or 7.1 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent - more than all the direct emissions from cars, aviation, ships and other transport. SPD agriculture spokesman Rainer Spiering said \"there are discount stores in Germany selling 500 grams of mince for \u20ac2.50 (\u00a32.30), and if the VAT rate goes up by 12 percentage points they will charge \u20ac2.80 - I think that is acceptable\". Germany's Die Zeit daily reports that the average German eats about 60kg (132 pounds) of meat annually, but the German Nutrition Society (DGE) recommends only half that amount as a healthy level.  In the first half of this year, German abattoirs produced 3.9m tonnes of meat. Slaughtered animals - excluding poultry - totalled 29.4m. Under EU rules, food generally qualifies for a reduced rate of VAT - as do many other essential goods and services.  But alcohol, fruit juice and some other types of food and drink are taxed at the standard rate. The minimum standard rate is 15%, and the lowest reduced rate is 5%.  In Germany, the reduced rate applies to pet food, but not to baby food. And carrots are reduced-rate, but not carrot juice.  In the UK the VAT rate on food is 0%, which  remains legal under EU rules , because it predates the 5% threshold set in 1991. VAT rates vary widely across the EU,  as taxation remains largely a national government responsibility. But the variation makes it harder to crack down on VAT fraud, and the EU has longstanding plans to reform VAT.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent This video can not be played The largest Arctic science expedition ever conceived is under way.  The German Research Vessel Polarstern left port late on Friday for the far north where it intends to lock itself in the sea-ice and drift for an entire year.  Hundreds of scientists will visit the ship in that time to use it as a base from which to study the climate. A large crowd gathered at the quayside in Troms\u00f8, Norway, to see the vessel off.  It is being accompanied on the first stage of its mission by the Russian icebreaker, the Akademik Federov. The pair will head to the Siberian sector of the Arctic ocean to find the most suitable place in the floes for the Polarstern to begin its drift. The  MOSAiC  (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) project is expected to cost about \u20ac130m (\u00a3120m\/$150m). Its scale means it must be an international effort. RV Polarstern will also be supported by icebreakers from Sweden and China. In deep winter, when these vessels can't pierce the ice to reach the German ship, aeroplanes and long-range helicopters will deliver the supplies and relief teams. On our way now! #Polarstern  heading north to take  #ClimateScience  to the next level! Video by Sebastian Grote  pic.twitter.com\/y6PeZ3kmvc MOSAiC's objective is to study all aspects of the climate system in the Arctic. Instrument stations will be set up on the ice around the Polarstern, some of them up to 50km away. The ice, the ocean, the atmosphere, even the wildlife - all will be sampled. The year-long investigations are designed to give more certainty to the projections of future change. Prof Markus Rex from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam is the expedition leader. He said the Arctic was currently warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet but that the climate models were highly uncertain as to how the temperature trends would develop in the coming decades. \"We don't have any robust climate predictions for the Arctic and the reason is we don't understand the processes there very well,\" he explained.  \"That's because we were never able to observe them year round and certainly not in winter when the ice is at its thickest and we can't break it with our research vessels,\" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Embedding in the sea-ice will be done close to 85 degrees North and 130 degrees East.  Precise positioning will be important. Modelling of the winds and currents suggests the ship should drift across the top of the planet, getting to within a couple of hundred km from the North Pole, before then being ejected from the frozen floes between northeast Greenland and Svalbard - the Fram Strait.  But there is a critical point in this 2,500km journey where, if the ship meanders too far to the west, it could get pulled into the Beaufort Gyre - the great clockwise movement of water and ice in the Arctic. Once caught in this gyre, it would need a huge effort to escape. Something similar to MOSAiC has been tried before. The expedition has definite echoes of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's attempt in the 1890s to be the first person to reach the North Pole by drifting in a ship locked in ice. The  Canadian Coast Guard vessel Des Groseilliers  mounted a drift mission in the late 1990s which became known as Ice Station SHEBA.  The  Norwegian Polar Institute's Lance vessel  undertook a drift expedition in 2015; as did  the scientific schooner Tara , which traversed the frozen ocean - again, from Siberian waters to the Fram Strait - in 2006\/7. But none of these previous ventures can be compared to the German mission for size and international input. The conditions faced by the scientists over the coming months will be harsh. For half the year the Sun will not rise above the horizon and temperatures will dip down to minus 45C. And the teams working on the ice will have to be on constant alert for predatory bears. \"Various scientists have been trained on using night-vision goggles to stand guard for polar bears,\" said Prof Julienne Stroeve from University College London (UCL).  \"You can't ever go out on the ice without someone being there with a rifle. [The bears] could eventually smell the ship and if they get curious enough they'll come and check us out.\" Prof Stroeve is in the seven participating teams from the UK. She will join the Polarstern in mid-winter. Her experiments will assess the accuracy of the radar satellites that are used to map the thickness of the sea-ice from orbit. These spacecraft work by bouncing a microwave pulse off the floes, but there is some uncertainty over where exactly this reflection occurs in a column of snow and ice. If the UCL scientist's suspicions are confirmed during the MOSAiC cruise, it would have implications for our current assessment of the status of Arctic sea-ice.  \"It would be thinner than what we've been estimating so far,\" she told the  BBC's Inside Science programme .

{"id":null,"body":"How does adaptation differ from mitigation? And what is REDD? The jargon of climate change can be hard to grasp. Use this glossary to decode it. Adaptation  Action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example construction of barriers to protect against rising sea levels, or conversion to crops capable of surviving high temperatures and drought. Adaptation fund  A fund for projects and programmes that help developing countries cope with the adverse effects of climate change.  It is financed by a share of proceeds from emission-reduction programmes such as the Clean Development Mechanism. Annex I countries  The industrialised countries (and countries in transition to a market economy) which took on obligations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Their combined emissions, averaged out during the 2008-2012 period, should be 5.2% below 1990 levels. Annex II  Countries which have a special obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to provide financial resources and transfer technology to developing countries. This group is a sub-section of the Annex I countries, excluding those that, in 1992, were in transition from centrally planned to a free market economy. Anthropogenic climate change  Man-made climate change - climate change caused by human activity as opposed to natural processes. Aosis  The Alliance of Small Island States comprises 42 island and coastal states mostly in the Pacific and Caribbean.  Members of Aosis are some of the countries likely to be hit hardest by global warming. The very existence of low-lying islands, such as the Maldives and some of the Bahamas, is threatened by rising waters.  AR4  The Fourth Assessment Report produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in 2007. The report assessed and summarised the climate change situation worldwide. It concluded that it was at least 90% likely that the increase of the global average temperature since the mid-20th Century was mainly due to man's activity.      AR5  The Fifth Assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published over 2013 and 2014. It says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s. Atmospheric aerosols  Microscopic particles suspended in the lower atmosphere that reflect sunlight back to space. These generally have a cooling affect on the planet and can mask global warming. They play a key role in the formation of clouds, fog, precipitation and ozone depletion in the atmosphere. Bali action plan  A plan drawn up at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, in December 2007, forming part of the Bali roadmap. The action plan established a working group to define a long-term global goal for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and a \"shared vision for long-term co-operative action\" in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology. Bali roadmap  A plan drawn up at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, in December 2007, to pave the way for an agreement at Copenhagen in 2009 on further efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol. The roadmap gave deadlines to two working groups, one working on the Bali action plan, and another discussing proposed emission reductions by Annex I countries after 2012. Baseline for cuts  The year against which countries measure their target decrease of emissions. The Kyoto Protocol uses a baseline year of 1990. Some countries prefer to use later baselines. Climate change legislation in the United States, for example, uses a 2005 baseline. Biofuel  A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize and sugar cane, and some forms of waste.   Black carbon  The soot that results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass (wood, animal dung, etc.). It is the most potent climate-warming aerosol. Unlike greenhouse gases, which trap infrared radiation that is already in the Earth's atmosphere, these particles absorb all wavelengths of sunlight and then re-emit this energy as infrared radiation. Business as usual  A scenario used for projections of future emissions assuming no action, or no new action, is taken to mitigate the problem. Some countries are pledging not to reduce their emissions but to make reductions compared to a business as usual scenario. Their emissions, therefore, would increase but less than they would have done. Cap and trade  An emission trading scheme whereby businesses or countries can buy or sell allowances to emit greenhouse gases via an exchange. The volume of allowances issued adds up to the limit, or cap, imposed by the authorities. Carbon capture and storage  The collection and transport of concentrated carbon dioxide gas from large emission sources, such as power plants. The gases are then injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. Carbon dioxide (CO2)  Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent  Six greenhouse gases are limited by the Kyoto Protocol and each has a different global warming potential. The overall warming effect of this cocktail of gases is often expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent - the amount of CO2 that would cause the same amount of warming. Carbon footprint  The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon intensity  A unit of measure. The amount of carbon emitted by a country per unit of Gross Domestic Product. Carbon leakage  A term used to refer to the problem whereby industry relocates to countries where emission regimes are weaker, or non-existent. Carbon neutral  A process where there is no net release of CO2. For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. Carbon offsetting  A way of compensating for emissions of CO2 by participating in, or funding, efforts to take CO2 out of the atmosphere. Offsetting often involves paying another party, somewhere else, to save emissions equivalent to those produced by your activity. Carbon sequestration  The process of storing carbon dioxide. This can happen naturally, as growing trees and plants turn CO2 into biomass (wood, leaves, and so on). It can also refer to the capture and storage of CO2 produced by industry. See Carbon capture and storage. Carbon sink  Any process, activity or mechanism that removes carbon from the atmosphere. The biggest carbon sinks are the world's oceans and forests, which absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the Earth's atmosphere. Certified Emission Reduction (CER)  A greenhouse gas trading credit, under the UN Clean Development Mechanism programme. A CER may be earned by participating in emission reduction programmes - installing green technology, or planting forests - in developing countries. Each CER is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide. CFCs  The short name for chlorofluorocarbons - a family of gases that have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion, but which are also potent greenhouse gases. Emissions of CFCs around the developed world are being phased out due to an international control agreement, the 1989 Montreal Protocol. Clean coal technology  Technology that enables coal to be burned without emitting CO2. Some systems currently being developed remove the CO2 before combustion, others remove it afterwards. Clean coal technology is unlikely to be widely available for at least a decade. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  A programme that enables developed countries or companies to earn credits by investing in greenhouse gas emission reduction or removal projects in developing countries. These credits can be used to offset emissions and bring the country or company below its mandatory target. Climate change  A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by yardsticks such as average temperature and rainfall, or an alteration in frequency of extreme weather conditions. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and human activity. Global warming is one aspect of climate change. CO2  See carbon dioxide. Country in transition  Broadly speaking, any ex-Soviet bloc state. At the time the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997, these countries were on the path from a Communist planned economy to a market economy. Many of them would now be categorised as market economies. Countries in transition to a market economy are grouped with industrialised countries in Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol, so they have emission reduction commitments to meet in the 2008-2012 period. In some cases their industrial base collapsed to such a degree in the early 1990s that they will have no difficulty meeting these commitments. Dangerous climate change  A term referring to severe climate change that will have a negative effect on societies, economies, and the environment as a whole. The phrase was introduced by the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to prevent \"dangerous\" human interference with the climate system. Deforestation  The permanent removal of standing forests that can lead to significant levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)  A scheme set up to allow the trading of emissions permits between business and\/or countries as part of a cap and trade approach to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The best-developed example is the EU's trading scheme, launched in 2005. See Cap and trade. EU Burden-sharing agreement  A political agreement that was reached to help the EU reach its emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol (a reduction of 8% during the period 2008-2012, on average, compared with 1990 levels). The 1998 agreement divided the burden unequally amongst member states, taking into account national conditions, including greenhouse gas emissions at the time, the opportunity for reducing them, and countries' levels of economic development. Feedback loop  In a feedback loop, rising temperatures on the Earth change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can be positive (adding to the rate of warming), or negative (reducing it). The melting of Arctic ice provides an example of a positive feedback process. As the ice on the surface of the Arctic Ocean melts away, there is a smaller area of white ice to reflect the Sun's heat back into space and more open, dark water to absorb it. The less ice there is, the more the water heats up, and the faster the remaining ice melts. Flexible mechanism  Instruments that help countries and companies meet emission reduction targets by paying others to reduce emissions for them. The mechanism in widest use is emissions trading, where companies or countries buy and sell permits to pollute. The Kyoto Protocol establishes two flexible mechanisms enabling rich countries to fund emission reduction projects in developing countries - Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Fossil fuels  Natural resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, containing hydrocarbons. These fuels are formed in the Earth over millions of years and produce carbon dioxide when burnt. G77  The main negotiating bloc for developing countries, allied with China (G77+China). The G77 comprises 130 countries, including India and Brazil, most African countries, the grouping of small island states (Aosis), the Gulf states and many others, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Geological sequestration  The injection of carbon dioxide into underground geological formations. When CO2 is injected into declining oil fields it can help to recover more of the oil. Global average temperature  The mean surface temperature of the Earth measured from three main sources: satellites, monthly readings from a network of over 3,000 surface temperature observation stations and sea surface temperature measurements taken mainly from the fleet of merchant ships, naval ships and data buoys. Global energy budget  The balance between the Earth's incoming and outgoing energy. The current global climate system must adjust to rising greenhouse gas levels and, in the very long term, the Earth must get rid of energy at the same rate at which it receives energy from the sun. Global dimming  An observed widespread reduction in sunlight at the surface of the Earth, which varies significantly between regions. The most likely cause of global dimming is an interaction between sunlight and microscopic aerosol particles from human activities. In some regions, such as Europe, global dimming no longer occurs, thanks to clean air regulations. Global warming  The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts believe is largely caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards, they suggest, even though the warmest year on record, according to the UK's Met Office, is 1998. Global Warming Potential (GWP)  A measure of a greenhouse gas's ability to absorb heat and warm the atmosphere over a given time period. It is measured relative to a similar mass of carbon dioxide, which has a GWP of 1.0. So, for example, methane has a GWP of 25 over 100 years, the metric used in the Kyoto Protocol. It is important to know the timescale, as gases are removed from the atmosphere at different rates. Greenhouse gases (GHGs)  Natural and industrial gases that trap heat from the Earth and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: natural (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and industrial (perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride). Greenhouse effect  The insulating effect of certain gases in the atmosphere, which allow solar radiation to warm the earth and then prevent some of the heat from escaping. See also Natural greenhouse effect. Hockey stick  The name given to a graph published in 1998 plotting the average temperature in the Northern hemisphere over the last 1,000 years. The line remains roughly flat until the last 100 years, when it bends sharply upwards. The graph has been cited as evidence to support the idea that global warming is a man-made phenomenon, but some scientists have challenged the data and methodology used to estimate historical temperatures. (It is also known as MBH98 after its creators, Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes.) IPCC  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical, and socio-economic work relevant to climate change, but does not carry out its own research. The IPCC was honoured with the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Joint implementation (JI)  An agreement between two parties whereby one party struggling to meet its emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol earns emission reduction units from another party's emission removal project. The JI is a flexible and cost-efficient way of fulfilling Kyoto agreements while also encouraging foreign investment and technology transfer. Kyoto Protocol  A protocol attached to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which sets legally binding commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. Industrialised countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions to 5.2% below 1990 levels during the five-year period 2008-2012. It was agreed by governments at a 1997 UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, but did not legally come into force until 2005. A different set of countries agreed a second commitment period in 2013 that will run until 2020. LDCs  Least Developed Countries represent the poorest and weakest countries in the world. The current list of LDCs includes 49 countries - 33 in Africa, 15 in Asia and the Pacific, and one in Latin America. LULUCF  This refers to Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry. Activities in LULUCF provide a method of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (i.e. by planting trees or managing forests), or by reducing emissions (i.e. by curbing deforestation and the associated burning of wood). Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate  A forum established in 2009 by US President Barack Obama to discuss elements of the agreement that will be negotiated at Copenhagen. Its members - Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, the UK and the US - account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. The forum is a modification of the Major Economies Meeting started by the former President George Bush, which was seen by some countries as an attempt to undermine UN negotiations. Methane  Methane is the second most important man-made greenhouse gas. Sources include both the natural world (wetlands, termites, wildfires) and human activity (agriculture, waste dumps, leaks from coal mining). Mitigation  Action that will reduce man-made climate change. This includes action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or absorb greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Natural greenhouse effect  The natural level of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which keeps the planet about 30C warmer than it would otherwise be - essential for life as we know it. Water vapour is the most important component of the natural greenhouse effect. Non-annex I countries  The group of developing countries that have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol. They do not have binding emission reduction targets. Ocean acidification  The ocean absorbs approximately one-fourth of man-made CO2 from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce adverse climate change effects. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions in the industrial era have already lowered the pH of seawater by 0.1. Ocean acidification can decrease the ability of marine organisms to build their shells and skeletal structures and kill off coral reefs, with serious effects for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Per-capita emissions  The total amount of greenhouse gas emitted by a country per unit of population. ppm (350\/450)  An abbreviation for parts per million, usually used as short for ppmv (parts per million by volume). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Current levels of CO2 only are about 380ppm. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide  The levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution. These levels are estimated to be about 280 parts per million (by volume). The current level is around 380ppm. Renewable energy  Renewable energy is energy created from sources that can be replenished in a short period of time. The five renewable sources used most often are: biomass (such as wood and biogas), the movement of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. REDD  Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, a concept that would provide developing countries with a financial incentive to preserve forests.  Stern review  A report on the economics of climate change led by Lord Nicholas Stern, a former World Bank economist. It was published on 30 October 2006 and argued that the cost of dealing with the consequences of climate change in the future would be higher than taking action to mitigate the problem now. Technology transfer  The process whereby technological advances are shared between different countries. Developed countries could, for example, share up-to-date renewable energy technologies with developing countries, in an effort to lower global greenhouse gas emissions. Tipping point  A tipping point is a threshold for change, which, when reached, results in a process that is difficult to reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions over the next 50 years or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. Twenty-twenty-twenty (20-20-20)  This refers to a pledge by the European Union to reach three targets by 2020: (a) a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; (b) an increase in the use of renewable energy to 20% of all energy consumed; and (c) a 20% increase in energy efficiency. The EU says it will reduce emissions by 30%, by 2020, if other developed countries also pledge tough action. UNFCCC  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is one of a series of international agreements on global environmental issues adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The UNFCCC aims to prevent \"dangerous\" human interference with the climate system. It entered into force on 21 March 1994 and has been ratified by 192 countries. Weather  The state of the atmosphere with regard to temperature, cloudiness, rainfall, wind and other meteorological conditions. It is not the same as climate which is the average weather over a much longer period.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The decline in sea ice seen in the Arctic in recent decades has been linked by scientists to the spread of a deadly virus in marine mammals.  Researchers found that Phocine distemper virus (PDV) had spread from animals in the North Atlantic to populations in the North Pacific. The scientists say the spread of pathogens could become more common as ice declines further. The 15-year study tracked seals, sea lions and otters via satellite.  The loss of sea ice in the Arctic has been one of the most visible signs of climate change on the planet over the past four decades. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the ice has been retreating by around 12% per decade between 1979 and 2018. \"These sea ice changes in September are likely unprecedented for at least 1,000 years. Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a transition to younger ice. Between 1979 and 2018, the real proportion of multi-year ice that is at least five years old has declined by approximately 90%,\" the IPCC said in their  report on the oceans and the cryosphere  published in September. Against this changing background, researchers have investigated the likely spread of the PDV infection, which caused a large number of deaths among harbour seals in the North Atlantic in 2002.  But outbreaks of the virus had not been seen in marine creatures in the North Pacific until 2004 when PDV was found in northern sea otters in Alaska.  Samples were collected from 2,500 marine mammals in a variety of locations over the course of the study.  Satellite data from tagged animals recorded locations. This was correlated with data on sea ice loss.  The scientists say that the record melt in August 2002 was followed by widespread exposure and infection with PDV in Steller sea lions in the North Pacific in 2003 and 2004 with over 30% of animals testing positive. PDV prevalence then declined until it peaked again in 2009, following on from the presence of open water routes in 2008. \"The loss of sea ice is leading marine wildlife to seek and forage in new habitats and removing that physical barrier, allowing for new pathways for them to move,\" said author Dr Tracey Goldstein, from the University of California, Davis.  \"As animals move and come in contact with other species, they carry opportunities to introduce and transmit new infectious disease, with potentially devastating impacts.\" The authors warn that this trend could continue as they believe climate driven changes in the Arctic ocean will increase. The opportunities for the spread of pathogens will likely grow, with uncertain health outcomes for many species.   The study  has been published  in the journal, Scientific Reports.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor Millions of people around the world could be exposed to dangerous levels of heat stress - a dangerous condition which can cause organs to shut down. Many live in developing countries, and do jobs that expose them to potentially life threatening conditions. These include being out in the open on farms and building sites or indoors in factories and hospitals.  Global warming will increase the chances of summer conditions that may be \"too hot for humans\" to work in.   When we caught up with Dr Jimmy Lee, his goggles were steamed up and there was sweat trickling off his neck. An emergency medic, he's labouring in the stifling heat of tropical Singapore to care for patients with Covid-19. There's no air conditioning - a deliberate choice, to prevent the virus being blown around - and he notices that he and his colleagues become \"more irritable, more short with each other\". And his personal protective equipment, essential for avoiding infection, makes things worse by creating a sweltering 'micro-climate' under the multiple layers of plastic. \"It really hits you when you first go in there,\" Dr Lee says, \"and it's really uncomfortable over a whole shift of eight hours - it affects morale.\" One danger, he realises, is that overheating can slow down their ability to do something that's vital for medical staff - make quick decisions.  Another is that they may ignore the warning signs of what's called heat stress - such as faintness and nausea - and keep on working till they collapse. It's when the body is unable to cool down properly so its core temperature keeps rising to dangerous levels and key organs can shut down. It happens when the main technique for getting rid of excess heat - the evaporation of sweat on the skin - can't take place because the air is too humid. This video can not be played And as Dr Lee and other medics have found, the impermeable layers of personal protection equipment (PPE) - designed to keep the virus out - have the effect of preventing the sweat from evaporating. According to Dr Rebecca Lucas, who researches physiology at the University of Birmingham, the symptoms can escalate from fainting and disorientation to cramps and failure of the guts and kidneys.  \"It can become very serious as you overheat, and in all areas of the body.\" A system known as the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) measures not only heat but also humidity and other factors to give a more realistic description of the conditions. Back in the 1950s, the US military used it to work out guidelines for keeping soldiers safe. When the WBGT reaches 29C, for example, the recommendation is to suspend exercise for anyone not acclimatised. Yet that's the level Dr Lee and his colleagues are regularly experiencing at Singapore's Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. And at the top of the scale - when the WBGT registers 32C - the US says strenuous training should stop because the risk becomes \"extreme\". But levels that high have recently been recorded inside hospitals in Chennai in India by Prof Vidhya Venugopal of the Sri Ramachandra University. She's also found workers in a salt pan enduring a WBGT that climbs during the day to 33C - at which point they have to seek shelter. And in a steel plant, a ferocious level of 41.7C was recorded, the workers being among the most vulnerable to what she calls \"the huge heat\". \"If this happens day-in, day-out, people become dehydrated, there are cardiovascular issues, kidney stones, heat exhaustion,\" Prof Venugopal says. As global temperatures rise, more intense humidity is likely as well which means more people will be exposed to more days with that hazardous combination of heat and moisture. Prof Richard Betts of the UK Met Office has run computer models which suggest that the number of days with a WBGT above 32C are set to increase, depending on whether greenhouse gas emissions are cut. And he spells out the risks for millions of people already having to work in the challenging combination of extreme heat and high humidity. \"We humans evolved to live in a particular range of temperatures, so it's clear that if we continue to cause temperatures to rise worldwide, sooner or later the hottest parts of the world could start to see conditions that are simply too hot for us.\" Another study, published earlier this year, warned that heat stress could affect as many as 1.2bn people around the world by 2100, four times more than now.  According to Dr Jimmy Lee, \"it's not rocket science\". People need to drink plenty of fluid before they start work, take regular breaks and then drink again when they rest. His hospital has started laying on \"slushie\" semi-frozen drinks to help the staff cool down. But he admits that avoiding heat stress is easier said than done. For him and his colleagues, going for rests involves the laborious process of changing out of PPE and then back into a new set of equipment. There's a practical problem as well - \"some people do not want to drink so they can avoid having to go to the toilet,\" he says. And there's a professional desire to keep working whatever the difficulties so as not to let colleagues and patients down at a time of crisis. People who are highly motivated can actually be at the greatest risk of heat injury, says Dr Jason Lee, an associate professor in physiology at the National University of Singapore. He's a leading member of a group specialising in the dangers of excessive heat, the Global Heat Health Information Network, which has  drawn up guidelines to help medics cope with Covid-19. It's spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the US weather and climate agency Noaa. Dr Lee says that as well as measures like rest and fluids - and shade for outdoor workers - a key strategy for resisting heat stress is to be fit. \"By keeping yourself aerobically fit, you're also increasing your heat tolerance, and there are so many other benefits too.\" And he sees the challenge for medics, sweating inside their PPE as they deal with Covid-19, as \"almost like a full dress rehearsal\" for future rises in temperature. \"This climate change will be a bigger monster and we really need a coordinated effort across nations to prepare for what is to come. \"If not,\" he says, \"there'll be a price to be paid.\"  Follow David  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The UK government remains committed to spending 0.7% of national income on foreign aid, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary dismissed as \"tittle tattle\" reports that the \u00a315bn aid budget could be cut to pay for more defence and intelligence spending.  Press reports suggest Chancellor Rishi Sunak will cut aid spending to help pay off rising debts in his Autumn budget. But Mr Raab said the 0.7% target was a manifesto commitment that was written into law.  His promise came as the newly-merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office began work, with a pledge to protect \"the world's poorest\" from coronavirus and famine. The new department is opening after No 10 decided to  combine the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Department for International Development (DfID). Asked if the 0.7% target would survive the merger, Mr Raab said: \"Oh, absolutely.\" He added that the development expertise the UK has got will be \"the beating heart of this new department\". The government is carrying out a review of defence and security policy, that is due to report back in November, and is also gearing up for the  comprehensive spending review , which will set departmental budgets for the next few years. According to The Times , Rishi Sunak is arguing that the Ministry of Defence's plans for advanced cyber weaponry and AI-enabled drones must be paid for out of the aid budget. Mr Raab said: \"Well, there is loads of tittle tattle, rather colourful, in the media and I am not going to prejudice the comprehensive spending review.\" He added that the government was committed to helping the poorest around the world and \"making sure we link up aid with our wider foreign policy goals\". Mr Raab has announced a \u00a3119m fund to tackle coronavirus and famine to mark the launch of the new, merged department. The money will be targeted in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan and West Africa's Sahel region - all places where the outbreak has worsened conditions for people already struggling with extreme hunger, wars and\/or climate change. The foreign secretary also confirmed he would be appointing Nick Dyer - a director general at DfID - as the UK's first special envoy for famine prevention and humanitarian affairs. The abolition of the Department for International Development may have been driven by political pressure from within the Conservative Party.  But the government argues that its merger with the Foreign Office will mean better, more joined-up policy.  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that by combining its diplomatic strength with its expertise in foreign aid, Britain could not only tackle global challenges, but also protect its interests.  Critics fear the new Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office could mean the government weakens its commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on foreign aid.  But Downing Street insisted there'd been no change to that policy.  The two departments have a history of being merged and split up again, and the move to bring them together has long been mooted in Conservative circles. Tory MP Harriet Baldwin - who held joint roles across the FCO and DfID - said it was \"really important to combine them\".  She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"[The move] will really increase the impact of our diplomatic clout, as well as our development expertise across the world.\" But Labour MP Hilary Benn, who was the international development secretary under Tony Blair, said he thought the merger was a \"mistake\" and questioned Mr Johnson's understanding of the department.  He told Today: \"The proof will be in how this new department develops and unfolds, but I think it will lead to less respect for what we are doing.\" Boris Johnson announced the merger in June, telling MPs it would ensure aid spending better reflected UK aims and that it was a \"long overdue reform\". He said UK aid spending had \"been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests\". But the PM pledged DfID's budget - which at \u00a315bn last year dwarfed the \u00a32.4bn spent by the Foreign Office - would be maintained Mr Johnson's decision was criticised by three previous prime ministers - Conservative David Cameron, and Labour's Gordon Brown and Mr Blair. This video can not be played Mr Cameron said it would mean \"less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas\". The Commons International Development Committee also called the move \"impulsive\", saying the world's poorest \"will pay the greatest price\". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledged to reinstate DfID if he were to win the next general election, saying the merger was \"the tactics of pure distraction\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Jack Goodman and Christopher Giles BBC Reality Check and Visual Journalism Preserving the Amazon rainforest is of global importance in the fight against climate change, but it is under threat from forest fires, mostly started to clear land for agriculture. Early numbers from this year's fire season show an increase, leading to concern from scientists. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil recently said that claims the Amazon \"is going up in flames\" were not true, despite statistics published by his own government showing the spread of fires. So what does the data show about what's happening this year? Brazil is a huge country with many different environments, including grassland, wetland and rainforest.  Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. So there's particular concern about the damage that fires might do here. The total number of fires in Brazil's Amazon until July this year is high - but slightly lower than the same period last year.  But there is concern about a surge in blazes last month, earlier than would normally be expected. \"If we consider the average number of fires in July over the period from 2010-2019, then the number of fires in July 2020 represented an increase of 55.6% of the average,\" says Prof Marcia Castro, a Brazilian scientist based at Harvard University.  \"An increase also happened in June (19.6% compared to June last year, and 36.1% compared to the average for the month of June between 2010-19). The peak of the fire season is often seen in August to September. \"So the consistent increase in June and July is worrisome,\" says Prof Castro.  And alerts so far in August look set to rival the number recorded last year. Fires this year are at the second highest level since 2010. In the first seven months of 2020, more than 13,000sq km (5,019sq miles) of the Brazilian Amazon was burned, according to analysis of satellite data provided by Dr Michelle Kalamandeen, a tropical ecologist on the Amazon rainforest. That's more than eight times the size of London. Dr Kalamandeen says the torched forest often struggles to grow back. \"When a forest is lost, it is gone forever. Recovery may occur but never 100% recovery,\" she says. When you look at the spread of the fires in Brazil, during the week of 11 August, there were noticeable clusters of fires in the Amazon, with Para, Mato Grosso, Amazonia and Rondonia states reporting a high number of alerts. In areas around Novo Progresso in Para state, farmers  reportedly held a \"day of fire\" last year  and satellites have picked up more than 1,300 fire alerts in the past month, according to official statistics. To the north-east, the large municipality of Altamira has recorded the most fires in Brazil's Amazon region during this  period.  Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre says there are two main issues contributing to forest fires this year.  The first is that this year's dry season is much drier than usual.  \"The waters of the tropical north Atlantic are warmer this year and when that happens, we have less rainfall over the southern Amazon,\" says Professor Nobre.  The second is that there is a lot of felled forest left over from last year's logging - this is chopped wood that can fuel fires. A lot of it didn't get burned as there was a military campaign to stop illegal activity in the forest This year, the army has been conducting an operation to stop deforestation since June, and in July, President Bolsonaro imposed a four-month ban on forest fires. Vice-President Hamilton Mourao recently launched a campaign against the fires, including an app for the public to report them. \"We will be out in the field in August to try to stop these fires becoming worse than last year,\" he told the BBC. Activists and government critics remain sceptical, says Camilla Costa, a BBC World Service journalist.  According to the Brazilian defence ministry, 28,100 cubic metres of illegal wood has been confiscated with fines totalling 407.2 million Brazilian reais ($72.6m; \u00a355m).   However, fires have continued in the region and critics complain about a lack of sufficient enforcement.  The number of forest fires in the Amazon regions of Colombia, Peru and Venezuela is up on this time last year.  For Amazonian countries, mining and agriculture is driving deforestation and as a result forest fires, according to Dr Kalamandeen.  In Venezuela, an increase in mining for gold is likely to be behind the increase, as since 2016 President Nicolas Maduro has opened up the sector to try and stem the country's economic collapse.  In Colombia, following the government's rapprochement with  rebel group Farc  in the past few years, areas have been opened up for farming, causing an increase in blazes, says Dr Kalamandeen.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The 10 years to the end of 2019 have been confirmed as the warmest decade on record by three global agencies.  According to Nasa, Noaa and the UK Met Office, last year was the second warmest in a record dating back to 1850. The past five years were the hottest in the 170-year series, with the average of each one more than 1C warmer than pre-industrial.  The Met Office says that 2020 is likely to continue this warming trend. 2016 remains the warmest year on record, when temperatures were boosted by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. Today's data doesn't come as a huge surprise, with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signalling  at the start of last December  that 2019 likely marked the end of the warmest decade on record.  The Met Office, which is involved in producing the HadCRUT4 temperature data, says that 2019 was 1.05C above the average for the period from 1850-1900.  Last year saw two major heat waves hit Europe in June and July, with a new national record of 46C set in France on 28 June. New records were also set in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and in the UK at 38.7C.   In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree.  by Roger Harrabin, Environment analyst As temperatures continue to rise, efforts to contain heating gases continue to falter as science collides with politics. The UK, for instance, fought hard to host the annual UN climate conference at the end of the year where all nations will be urged towards deeper emissions cuts. And Boris Johnson says he wants the UK to lead the world on climate change.  But in the first test of his new administration he's already being accused of abandoning his principles. He's promising to consider cutting the \u00a313 tax on flights in the UK because jobs and connectivity are at stake. This contradicts his official advice from the Climate Change Committee which says people need to fly less, so the cost of flying should go up, not down. This sort of uncomfortable trade-off will cause ruffles around the world in coming decades as climate change presents an increasing challenge to politics-as-usual. While the three different research agencies all have slightly different figures for the past 12 months, the WMO has carried out an analysis that uses additional data from the Copernicus climate change service and the Japan Meteorological Agency.  They conclude that in 2019, the world was 1.1C warmer than in the pre-industrial period.  \"Our collective global temperature figures agree that 2019 joins the other years from 2015 as the five warmest years on record,\" said Dr Colin Morice, from the Met Office Hadley Centre. \"Each decade from the 1980s has been successively warmer than all the decades that came before. 2019 concludes the warmest 'cardinal' decade (those spanning years ending 0-9) in records that stretch back to the mid-19th century.\" Researchers say carbon emissions from human activities are the main cause of the sustained temperature rise seen in recent years.  \"Carbon dioxide levels are at the highest that we've ever recorded in our atmosphere, and there is a definite connection between the amount of CO2 and the temperature,\" said Prof Liz Bentley from the Royal Meteorological Society. \"We are seeing the highest global temperatures in the last decade and we will see more of that. As the CO2 continues to grow, we'll see global temperatures increasing.\" Having the long term data from three different agencies with different methodologies gives them confidence in the accuracy of their findings.  \"While we know that human activities are causing the globe to warm, it is important to measure this warming as accurately as possible,\" said Prof Tim Osborn, from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, which is involved in gathering the data. \"We are confident that the world has warmed by about 1C since the late nineteenth century because different methods of working out the global temperature give very similar results.\" While the figures released by the Met Office, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and Nasa show the temperature recorded on the land and sea surfaces, the amount of warming going into the deeper ocean is also at record levels. Data published this week showed that a record amount of heat went into the oceans last year. This was the biggest increase in the last decade.  While natural variability means that scientists don't expect new temperature records year-on-year, the Met Office is forecasting that 2020 will also be very hot, with the global average temperature estimated to be 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This suggests it will be a warmer year than the one just passed. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Mary Halton BBC News, science reporter Women are more likely than men to be affected by climate change, studies show. UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted. In central Africa,  where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared , nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk. As the lake's shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water.  \"In the dry season, men go to the towns... leaving women to look after the community,\" explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT).  With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support. \"They become more vulnerable... it's very hard work,\" Ibrahim recently told the  BBC's 100 Women  initiative.  It is not just women in rural areas who are affected. Globally, women are  more likely to experience poverty , and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, African American women were among the worst affected by flooding in Louisiana. As sea levels rise, low-lying cities like New Orleans will be  increasingly at risk . \"In New Orleans, there was much higher poverty among the African American population before Katrina,\" says Jacquelyn Litt, professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University.  \"More than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers,\" she told BBC News. \"[They] are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources. The displacement that happened after Katrina essentially eroded those networks. It places women and their children at much greater risk.\" In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women. The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, didn't have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there.  Increased incidences of violence against women, including sexual assault and rape, have also been documented in the wake of disasters.  Much as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures. Disasters do not affect all people equally. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India.  While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region. Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives. Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger.  In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced. In recognition of this vast disparity, governments and organisations working on climate change are gradually moving to include women's voices in policy and planning. The UN has highlighted the need for gender sensitive responses to the impacts of climate change, yet the average representation of women in national and global climate negotiating bodies is below 30%.  The numbers don't improve at the local level. \"Women are often not involved in the decisions made about the responses to climate change, so the money ends up going to the men rather than the women,\" environmental scientist Diana Liverman told the BBC's  Science in Action  programme on the World Service this week. As an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose reports influence climate change policy, Liverman has been monitoring the numbers of women involved.  Twenty-five percent of those nominated to participate in the next report are women. \"IPCC has been very receptive to this and is actually discussing how they can support women better,\" explains Liverman. \"Women are half the world. It's important they participate in all major decisions,\"  \"Climate change is not a fight for power,\" points out Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, \"it's a fight for survival.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Kevin Keane BBC Scotland's environment correspondent This video can not be played Like superheroes, their job is to save the planet and this week 180 climate scientists are meeting in Edinburgh to plan their next move. To be technical, they are Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - but clearly that doesn't sound so exciting. Six months ago, the IPCC warned the world that \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented\" changes were needed if the climate crisis was to be tackled effectively. Those same scientists will this week begin the next phase of that work in Scotland's capital. Co-chair, Prof Jim Skea, who is originally from Dundee, said: \"Our ambition is to equip governments with the information they need to act now, keeping in mind the goals of the Paris Agreement and national ambitions to achieve net zero emissions.\" The Paris Agreement, reached in 2015,  committed the world's nations to keeping global temperature rises \"well below\" 2C and \"endeavour to limit\" them to 1.5C. But, after years of research, the IPCC warned in October 2018 that almost all the world's coral reefs would be destroyed if the higher temperature was reached. The work beginning in Edinburgh will assess the mitigation of climate change - that is, what can be done to slow it down. It will examine the link between greenhouse gas emissions and the way we live our lives. The role of technology, through schemes such as carbon capture and storage, will also be scrutinised. Co-chair Priyadarshi R Shukla added: \"This report will provide governments with scientific information to underpin responses to climate change in the context of sustainable development.\" Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: \"The IPCC provides governments at all levels and across the world with scientific information that can, and in my view should, be used to inform our climate change priorities. \"Their role is one that I am deeply respectful of and I am pleased that we have been able to support their work in this way.\" The meeting is being hosted by the Scottish government at the John McIntyre Conference Centre. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger It coincides with an opinion poll by YouGov for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland (SCCS) which said 70% of respondents supported greater action to tackle climate change. Gail Wilson, SCCS campaigns manager, said: \"Climate change will do irreversible damage to our planet if we don't do more to tackle it now. This new polling shows that people in Scotland recognise the seriousness of the situation and want more action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"MSPs at Holyrood must take note of the growing clamour for urgent action on climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new type of white paint has the potential to cool buildings and reduce the reliance on air conditioning, say researchers.  In a study, the new product was able to reflect 95.5% of sunlight and reduce temperatures by 1.7C compared to the ambient air conditions. The engineers involved say the impact is achieved by adding different-sized particles of calcium carbonate. Buildings of all types are one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions. According to the World Green Building Council, the  lighting, heating and cooling of buildings  is responsible for around 28% of global CO2.  That's because the heating and cooling of buildings is mainly powered by coal, oil and gas - In Europe,  around 75% of this energy need  comes from fossil fuels. For decades, researchers have been trying to come up with ideas to increase the efficiency of cooling and heating. A number of reflective paints have been developed for the outside of homes and offices that would reflect away sunlight and reduce the temperatures inside.  As yet, none of these products have been able to deflect enough of the Sun's rays to make the building's temperature lower than the ambient conditions.  Now, researchers in the US say they have developed a white paint with strong cooling properties.  \"In one experiment where we put a painted surface outside under direct sunlight, the surface cooled 1.7C below the ambient temperature and during night time it even cooled up to 10C below the ambient temperature,\" said Prof Xiulin Ruan, from Purdue University in Indiana, who's an author on the study. \"This is a significant amount of cooling power that can offset the majority of the air conditioning needs for typical buildings.\" So how does the new paint work? According to the researchers, the key has been to add calcium carbonate to the mix. The scientists found that by using high concentrations of this chalky substance, with differing particle sizes, they were able to develop a product that reflected 95.5% of sunlight.  \"Sunlight is a broad spectrum of wavelengths,\" said Prof Xiulin Ruan. \"We know that each particle size can only scatter one wavelength effectively so we decided to use different particle sizes to scatter all the wavelengths. This is an important contributor eventually resulting in this very high reflectance.\" The researchers say the paint may have a broad range of applications - particularly in data centres, which require large amounts of cooling. Since the paint lacks metallic components, it is unlikely to interfere with electromagnetic signals, making it suitable for cooling telecommunications equipment. There are a number of steps to go through before this product will be available commercially, as it needs to be tested for its long-term reliability and efficiency. But the researchers are optimistic; patents have been filed and there is strong interest from major manufacturers.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor Ever wondered if your bank or insurance company is funding the coal industry? Or whether your pension fund is backing oil companies drilling new wells in the Arctic? Investors are facing scrutiny like never before about what they're doing to tackle climate change. And the Bank of England has now launched a push to engage the entire business world.   The aim is to get every company, large or small, to think about global warming as a normal part of their decision-making. And the hope is this will encourage them to come up with plans to become carbon neutral or \"net zero\".  This comes amid a flurry of climate announcements from some very big corporate names. The oil giant BP has pledged to be net zero by 2050 and the world's largest asset manager, Blackrock, has warned companies that it won't invest in them unless they try to decarbonise. There's a series of moves to involve private finance in the run-up to the crucial COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. The diplomatic focus at that event will be on whether the world's governments commit to deeper cuts in the gases that are heating the planet. But it's also seen as vital to persuade business to take action in ways that avoid the most dangerous effects of rising temperatures.  One plan is to boost the number of banks, insurers and pension funds signed up to be more open about their carbon footprints and plans to improve them. Known as the TCFD - or Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures - the project already has the backing of companies with balance sheets worth a total of $135tn. Under this system, there are no obligations on business leaders to come up with plans to go net zero, but if a company is not taking much action, that fact will be exposed to public gaze.  And already investors with $5tn in assets have committed to making sure their portfolios are carbon neutral by 2050.  Another initiative was launched last year for banks to \"stress test\" the risks they face of losing money as the world moves away from fossil fuels. For example, loans to coal-fired power stations could turn bad if a government decides to phase out coal power sooner than expected, leaving the bank with what are called \"stranded assets\".   Central to this process is Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who is the prime minister's finance adviser for the climate summit and also a special envoy for the UN secretary-general.  Speaking at an event to launch this agenda, he said: \"Given the scale of the climate challenge and the rising expectations of our citizens, 2020 must be a year of climate action where everybody's in, and that includes the world's leading financial centre.  \"To identify the largest opportunities and to manage the associated risks, disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net zero world must go mainstream.\"  In his first public comments as business secretary and president of the summit, Alok Sharma echoed the appeal for the corporate world to support the move to net zero. Describing this year as \"pivotal for the planet\", he told the gathering that dealing with climate change was not just for governments. \"We are calling on action from everyone - businesses, civil society and each part of the global financial system to meet the Paris agreement goals.\" BP boss plans to 'reinvent' oil giant for green era A really simple guide to climate change Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"A UN panel has released the most comprehensive assessment yet of the effects of climate change on our planet. Members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say the  \"summary for policymakers\"  provides overwhelming evidence of the scale of these impacts. The BBC News website's science editor Paul Rincon breaks down the key findings. \"In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.\" Most of the observed changes resulting from climate change concern natural systems, such as water resources, sea levels or biodiversity. But changes to human systems such as food production and livelihoods have also been attributed to global warming. The report has medium confidence that global warming is altering patterns of rainfall or melting snow and ice, and that this is affecting water resources in terms of both quality and quantity. The scientists also have high confidence that wildlife on land, in the rivers and in the oceans have shifted their geographic ranges, migration patterns and seasonal behaviour. Few extinctions have been tied to man-made global warming so far, but the report points out that much slower episodes of climate change over millions of years caused significant ecosystem changes and the disappearance of numerous species. Previous studies have shown a mixture of impacts on food production, with some areas benefiting from changes, while others are hit hard. The authors say with high confidence that the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones. \"Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of response.\" Throughout history, people have tried to cope with a changing climate - with varying degrees of success, the report says. The document says that governments at various levels are beginning to develop adaptation plans and integrate climate considerations into existing programmes such as disaster risk management and water management. The authors then present summaries of the steps different regions are taking to adapt to climate change. Progress has been variable. In Africa, for example, governments have started to build systems for disaster risk management and are taking basic public health measures. But it points out that such efforts have tended to be isolated so far. In Europe, adaptation policies have been developed across all levels of government, while in North America, \"incremental\" planning is taking place, with some proactive adaptation to protect long-term investments in energy infrastructure. Oceania's adaptation efforts have been focused around sea level rise, and in southern Australia, on water scarcity. The report stresses the importance of adaptation, explaining that the ways in which societies respond will influence the risks of climate change throughout the 21st Century. But the report warns that the effectiveness of adaptation can be limited. Continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate impacts, as well as the long timeframes involved, complicate the decision-making process. The report lays out a number of principles for effective adaptation. For example, planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions by different governments. \"The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change.\" In other words, we might not need to adapt so much if we tackle the causes of climate change itself. The risks associated with global warming are lessened under low temperature rise projections compared with those applying under the highest projections. However, under all the different temperature scenarios in the future, some risk from adverse impacts remains.  The document outlines the key risks of continued warming, according to criteria such as their magnitude, probability, or irreversibility. They have also been designed to comply with article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which refers to \"dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". The eight key risks refer to possible deaths, injuries and health impacts associated with, for example, flooding in low-lying coastal zones or heat waves. The breakdown of infrastructure following extreme weather events; the disruption of food production and supply; and the negative impact on communities that depend on threatened ecosystems - such as coastal fisheries - also make the list. Furthermore, these risks are grouped into a smaller number of categories known as \"reasons for concern\". These include singular events, such as loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which would raise the sea level by a staggering seven metres. \"Climate change is projected to amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.\" Some of the risks associated with climate change will be limited to particular sectors or regions of the world, but some will have cascading effects.  The latter half of the report contains more detail on these impacts. The fraction of the global population experiencing water scarcity and the proportion affected by major river floods are expected to increase with the level of warming over the 21st Century. In addition, coastal and low-lying areas will experience submergence, flooding and erosion due to sea-level rise. Land-based and freshwater wildlife species face an increased risk of extinction under the projected climate change scenarios for the century, especially as global warming interacts with other factors such as habitat changes, exploitation by humans, and invasive species. Under the high emissions scenarios, there is a \"high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change\" to those same ecosystems. Fish and other marine animals will shift their ranges, causing invasions of high-latitude seas by low latitude species and local extinctions of marine animals in the tropics. This poses the risk of reduced supplies of fish with consequences for incomes and employment. Ocean acidification also poses substantial risks to marine ecosystems, particularly at the poles and at coral reefs. For the major food crops, such as wheat, rice and maize, in tropical and temperate regions, global warming without adaptation is projected to negatively affect production for temperature rises of 2C or more above 20th Century levels. While positive effects are also expected, all aspects of food security are potentially impacted by climate change. The report says the impacts on the global economy are difficult to estimate, but continued warming is expected to slow down economic growth, making efforts to tackle poverty more difficult. Human health and security - in the form of increased migration, increased conflict and implications for territorial integrity from, for example, inundation of land by rising seas - will also be affected by climate change.

Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for \u2018Carbon Capture and Utilisation\u2019. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was \"one of the greatest challenges of the present day\". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sun\u2019s rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europe\u2019s hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture \u2013 cows emit large amounts \u2013 as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the world\u2019s oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM \/ ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a \u2018tipping point\u2019, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent In its first major update on climate change in almost 10 years, the Met Office has warned of significant temperature rises in the decades ahead. The  UK Climate Projections 2018  study is the most up to date assessment of how the UK may change over this century. It says that under the highest emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be 5.4C hotter by 2070. The chances of a summer as warm as 2018 are around 50% by 2050. One key figure in the report is the rise in summer temperatures  - up to 5.4C warmer than the average between 1981-2000.  This would only happen, according to the Met Office, if the world was to continue increasing emissions of carbon dioxide rather than reducing them as most governments intend.  So for a central location in England like Nottingham, the Met Office says that, under a high emissions future (where greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over coming decades are at the high end of all possible scenarios), temperatures could rise by between 1.1C to 5.8C.  For other central locations in the nations of the UK, there are similar ranges of projected temperature rises.  In Scotland, at Pitlochry, the summer rise ranges from 0.6C to 4.8C warmer. Around Aberystwyth in Wales, they range from 0.9C to 5.9C warmer while Cookstown in Northern Ireland could be 0.8 to 4.9C hotter. But even under a low emissions scenario, the Met Office says that the UK will see an increase in the average yearly temperature of up to 2.3C by 2100. Summers as warm as the one just past, are likely to be very common, with a 50% chance of occurring.  \"With really hot summers like this year's - in the 1990s that was a less than 5% chance of getting those,\" said Met Office chief scientist Dr Stephen Belcher.  \"Now we are up to a 15-20% chance. By 2050 that's a normal summer\u2026By late century it depends what we do about greenhouse gases.\" These warmer summers of the future are likely to be much drier too, with average summer rainfall dropping by 47% by 2070. Winters could be warmer by up to 4.2C but they will also see more rainfall, increasing by up to 35% by 2070, under the worst emissions scenario. Raised sea levels are also one of the consequences of a warmer world and according to the report, they could increase by 1.15 metres in London by 2100. The report says the UK is set to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels. Just a few weeks ago the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC)  warned that by 2080 up to 1.2 million homes  may be at increased risk of flooding.  \"The UK18 projections are further evidence that we will see more extreme weather in the future - we need to prepare and adapt now, climate change impacts are already being felt with the record books being re-written,\" said Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency. \"The Environment Agency cannot wall up the country, but will be at the forefront - protecting communities, building resilience, and responding to incidents.\" Environment Secretary Michael Gove praised the new study as an \"invaluable tool\" as it will help with decisions on large infrastructure. \"It is clear that the planet and its weather patterns are changing before our eyes,\" he said, launching the report at the Science Museum in London. \"We know, more than ever before, the urgency of acting.\" This video can not be played Mr Gove has been stressing that Britain has a good track record on climate change, having cut emissions by 40% since 1990 while continuing to grow the economy. However, other political figures say that the new report underlines how much more needs to be done.  \"These projections paint a devastating picture of what climate breakdown means for the UK if we continue down the path we're on,\" said Green party MP Caroline Lucas.  \"Michael Gove's vague talk of mitigating the worst impacts of floods, droughts and storms are far from reassuring.\" Some researchers were also critical of the report, saying that it gave the impression that scientists can give more detail about the future than is possible.  \"It (the report) feeds our desire for specifics and for high resolution pictures,\" said Prof David Stainforth from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment.   \"It is valuable in bringing to life the types of changes we want to avoid. It is, however, based on research at the edge of scientific understanding, using methods whose reliability has been questioned. It is not reliable and robust in the way that knowledge of the climate change threat is, so it creates its own risks.\"  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says that the physical and financial impacts of global warming are accelerating. Record greenhouse gas levels are driving temperatures to \"increasingly dangerous levels\", it says. Their report comes in the same week as the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported a surge in CO2 in 2018. However, new data from the UK suggests Britain is bucking the trend with emissions down by 3%. This year's  State of the Climate  report from the WMO is the 25th annual record of the climate.  When it first came out in 1993, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. These have now risen to 405.5ppm and are expected to increase further. This is having a significant impact on temperatures, with 2018 the fourth warmest year on record, almost 1C above what they were in the period between 1850-1900. The years between 2015 and 2018 were the four warmest on that record, the study says. \"This report makes it very clear that the impacts of climate change are accelerating,\" said Prof Samantha Hepburn who is director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resource Law at Deakin University in Australia. \"We know that if the current trajectory for greenhouse gas concentrations continues, temperatures may increase by 3 - 5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and we have already reached 1 degree.\" While some of these figures were  published in a preliminary release  of the study from last November, the full version has data on many key climate indicators, that the WMO says break new ground.  One example is ocean heat content. More than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the seas and according to the WMO, 2018 saw new records set for the amount of ocean heat content found in the upper 700 metres of the seas, and also for the upper 2,000 metres.  Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger Sea levels also continued to increase with global mean sea level rising 3.7mm higher in 2018 than the previous year.  \"This report highlights the increase in the rate of sea-level rise, and this is a real concern for those living in low-lying coastal areas, for both developed and developing countries,\" said Dr Sally Brown, a research fellow at the University of Southampton. \"We know that sea-level rise is a global problem that will not go away, and efforts need to be made to help those who are really vulnerable to adapt to sea-level rise or move to safer areas.\" The head of the WMO say that the signals of warming continue to be seen in events since the turn of the year.  \"Extreme weather has continued in the early 2019, most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and tragic loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It may turn out to be one of the deadliest weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere,\" said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas.  \"Idai made landfall over the city of Beira: a rapidly growing, low-lying city on a coastline vulnerable to storm surges and already facing the consequences of sea level rise. Idai's victims personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,\" said Mr Taalas.  The report has been launched at a news conference in New York attended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.  \"There is no longer any time for delay,\" he wrote in a foreword to the new study. However earlier this week the International Energy Agency  published worrying data , indicating that in 2018 carbon emissions were up 1.7%, as a result of the fastest growth in energy use in the last six years.  The UK government has also released emissions data about greenhouse gas emissions over the past year. The figures show that emissions across the UK have fallen by 3% over the last year, the equivalent the government says, of taking 5 million cars off the road. Factors driving UK emissions down include the fact that coal was the source of just 5% of electricity in 2018. The government now says that carbon emissions are at their lowest level since before the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Scientists say the loss of ice in Greenland lurched forward again last year, breaking the previous record by 15%. A  new analysis  says that the scale of the melt was \"unprecedented\" in records dating back to 1948. High pressure systems that became blocked over Greenland last Summer were the immediate cause of the huge losses. But the authors say ongoing emissions of carbon are pushing Greenland into an era of more extreme melting. Over the past 30 years, Greenland's contribution to global sea levels has grown significantly as ice losses have increased.  A  major international report on Greenland released last December  concluded that it was losing ice seven times faster than it was during the 1990s.  Today's new study shows that trend is continuing.  Using data from the Grace and Grace-FO satellites, as well as climate models, the authors conclude that across the full year Greenland lost 532 gigatonnes of ice - a significant increase on 2012.  The researchers say the loss is the equivalent of adding 1.5mm to global mean sea levels, approximately 40% of the average rise in one year.  According to a calculation by Danish climate scientist Martin Stendel, the 2019 losses would be enough to cover the entire UK with around 2.5 metres of melt water. Both last year and 2012 were marked by \"blocking\" events, the researchers say, where disturbances in the jet stream saw high pressure systems become stuck over Greenland, resulting in enhanced melting. \"We seem to have entered a realm of more and more extreme melt in Greenland,\" said lead author Dr Ingo Sasgen, from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.  \"It's expected that something like the 2019 or 2012 years will be repeated. And we don't exactly know how the ice behaves in terms of feedback mechanisms in this vigorous range of melting.\"  \"There could be... hidden feedbacks that we are not aware about or that are maybe not perfectly described in the models right now. That could lead to some surprises.\" This video can not be played While 2019 broke the record, both 2018 and 2017 saw decreased ice losses, lower than any other two-year period since 2003.  The authors say this was due to two very cold summers in Greenland followed by heavy snows in autumn. However the return to high levels of melting in 2019 is a major concern. Five of the years with the biggest mass loss have now occurred in the past decade. \"What really matters is the trend,\" said Dr Ruth Mottram, from the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, who wasn't involved with this new study. \"And that trend as shown through the Imbie (Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise) project and other work is tracking the high end of projections.\" While 2020 has so far seen average conditions in Greenland, the overall impact of the massive ice losses seen in recent years could have major implications for people living in low lying areas of the world. \"The result for 2019 confirms that the ice sheet has returned to a state of high loss, in line with the IPCCs worst-case climate warming scenario,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd from Leeds University, who is the co-lead investigator for Imbie. 'This means we need to prepare for an extra 10cm or so of global sea level rise by 2100 from Greenland alone.\" \"And at the same time we have to invent a new worst-case climate warming scenario, because Greenland is already tracking the current one.\" \"If Greenland's ice losses continue on their current trajectory, an extra 25 million people could be flooded each year by the end of this century.\" Recent media reports have suggested that Greenland may have passed a point of no return, that the level of global warming that the world is already committed to because of carbon emissions, means that all of Greenland will melt.  Dr Sasgen says that this perspective may be correct - but Greenland's fate is still in our hands. \"The rates of sea level rise we expect from Greenland, and the risk of sudden sea level rise from Greenland is drastically reduced if we stay below the warming limits,\" he said.  \"The take home message is that if we reduce CO2, and we reduce or limit global warming, then also the risk for huge contributions from Greenland in the near future will also be reduced.\" The paper has been published in the Nature journal  Communications Earth & Environment .

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played An MP has called for a \"system change\" after she was stopped by police while travelling in a car in east London.  Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler accused the Met Police of  racial profiling after the stop on Sunday. Labour MP Ms Butler told BBC Breakfast she had agreed to meet local police commanders to discuss \"taking the bias out of the system\". The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. Ms Butler said it had been  20 years since the Macpherson Report  into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which described the Met Police as \"institutionally racist\". \"It's about time we changed the system so it works for everyone and it's effective,\" she said. The MP said institutional racism was \"not about saying every single police officer is racist\". \"If you see black people in a car and you automatically assume that they are criminals there is a problem there,\" she said. \"That's why you have to address the system that is currently biased against black people.\"  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the police should treat people with \"fairness and equality\". He said: \"The police have made a statement saying that they made a mistake. \"They have spoken to the occupants of the car but it's obviously very, very important that the Met continue to do everything that they can - as indeed they do - to show that they are serving every part of our country, every part of our community, with fairness and equality.\"  I JUST GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE DRIVING THROUGH HACKNEY... MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW... @metpoliceuk   I recorded the whole incident. Ms Butler said the BMW that was stopped on Sunday was being driven by a black male friend and it was pulled over by two police cars. She said officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the keys while checking the registration. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver and apologised, she said. Ms Butler told the BBC: \"I still don't know why they punched the number plate into the system.  \"I don't know what raised their suspicion. All I know is I'm black, my friend was black and he has a fairly decent car.\" In a statement, the Met said \"one of the occupants\" had been contacted by a senior officer and they had discussed \"subsequent interaction as well as feedback regarding the stop\". It added: \"We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with the occupants if they wish to do so.\" The force's statement did not explain why the car registration was entered in the first place. Met Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh said checking car registrations was a \"normal routine piece of work\" for officers. He told the BBC he was \"very disappointed\" Ms Butler had posted the video of her stop. Mr Marsh said: \"You would have thought someone in the situation she is in would try and defuse a situation rather than cause such an absolute furore.\" His colleagues had \"acted professionally throughout\" and admitted their mistake, he added. The Police Federation - the organisation that represents police officers across Wales and England - is calling for the body-worn camera footage from officers at the incident to be released. Susan Hall, Conservative leader on the London Assembly, has written to the Met Police commissioner in support of releasing the police officer's footage. Ms Hall  tweeted : \"If Dawn Butler wants to play politics with police officers doing their job, Londoners should have all the facts.\" Ms Butler said she had already spoken to her local borough commander and further meetings were planned. The MP also said stop and search needed to be revised to a system with \"better outcomes\", but \"it's going to take an intense amount of work\". Ch Supt Roy Smith  tweeted on Sunday  to say he had spoken to Ms Butler and she had given \"a very balanced account of the incident\". The officer said the force \"are listening\" to concerns she had about the stop and the officers involved. Since raising the issue Ms Butler has been subjected to racist abuse on social media.  Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"it is imperative that the black community have trust and confidence in our police\". \"All allegations of racial profiling must be taken extremely seriously by the Metropolitan Police,\" he added. Sir Keir said the abuse Ms Butler had suffered on social media was \"wrong and must be condemned\". The Independent Office for Police Conduct  is investigating  whether officers in England and Wales racially discriminate against ethnic minority people. BBC analysis shows that from August 2019 to July 2020 there were 101 stop and searches for every 1,000 black people in London, compared to 23.2 for every 1,000 white people and 28.7 per 1,000 Asian people. A police officer can legally stop any vehicle at any time. Police have the power to stop and search anyone if an officer has reasonable grounds to believe someone has been involved in a crime or is in possession of a prohibited item.

{"id":null,"body":"By Gena-mour Barrett Newsbeat reporter Science fiction has long been criticised for its lack of racial diversity and inclusion.  It's rare to see a lead character who isn't white. One study of the top 100 highest-grossing films in the US showed that just eight of those 100 movies had a non-white protagonist, as of 2014. Six of those eight were Will Smith, according to diversity-focused book publisher Lee and Low Books. The long-term exclusion of people of colour from science fiction offers up an interesting paradox. How can a genre that imagines a future of infinite possibilities be seemingly unable to imagine a future where black people exist - or at least have any relevance?  Herein lies the power (and importance) of afrofuturism, and while you may not have heard of the term, there's a good chance you've been introduced to it already.   The #DirtyComputer Emotion Picture Premieres at 12 Midnight TONIGHT on @BET & @BET_Jams ! \ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f A post shared by   Janelle Mon\u00e1e  (@janellemonae) on  Apr 26, 2018 at 7:05am PDT Afrofuturism is perhaps best summed up by the queen of contemporary afrofuturism herself \u2014 Janelle Monae.  Her futuristic music videos and radical aesthetic (she even calls her fans \"fAndroids\") are seen by some as a key force for pushing afrofuturism into the mainstream. \"Afrofuturism is me, us... is black people seeing ourselves in the future,\"  she explains  in a 30-second video clip for Spotify. It is no surprise then that Janelle cites the movement as the inspiration for her new narrative film, Dirty Computer: Emotion Picture, a visual accompaniment to her latest album (which is currently trending on YouTube).  \"I was writing this music that was really inspired by science fiction and afrofuturism,\" she told BBC Radio 1 in March.  \"Telling these stories through the lens of a young black woman and speaking of a future where we're included, we're not the minority, but we're the heroines, we're the leaders, we're the heroes... I felt like I had a responsibility to [do] that.\" The 44-minute film, starring and produced by Janelle, tells the story of Jane 57821, a woman who's on the run from a totalitarian government that seeks to scrape her memories. The film features minority groups who are under threat - including people of colour and LGBTQ individuals. Co-director of Dirty Computer Andrew Donoho told Newsbeat that viewers can expect to see a film that pulls inspiration from a long list of sci-films through the lens of afrofuturism. \"The entire project was about exploring the sci-fi landscape that we all knew and loved so much, while injecting Jane's commentary about race, sexuality, and the future of black culture.  \"We wanted a true sci-film that properly represented the black and LGBTQ community in a way that was honest - something rare in Hollywood,\" he added.  The term \"afrofuturism\" was originally coined and defined by cultural critic Mark Derry in a 1993 essay entitled \"Black to the Future\", although the idea has existed for much longer.  Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, TLC, and Solange Knowles have all been credited with exploring the movement, but one of its most famous contributors to the genre is the musician and poet Sun Ra.  Regarded as a pioneer of afrofuturism with more than 1,000 recorded songs spanning more than 100 albums, he is particularly well-known for telling his own fictional origin story - that he was an alien who'd come to Earth from Saturn, sent on a mission to preach peace and speak through music.  During his career, Sun Ra and his band (the Arkestra) went on a 25-year-long tour performing and selling their music. The band continues to perform following the death of Sun Ra in 1993. Aside from music and film however, afrofuturism also incorporates literature and art, combining them with science fiction, history, and fantasy. Afrofuturism can be split two simple questions: \"Who are we?\" and \"What is true about the world?\" according to Steven Barnes, a professional science fiction writer and lecturer on the topic. \"It is just our perspective on the question of how did we get here, what's going on, and what's the future going to be like? Which are the basic questions that you find answered through science fiction. \"Afrofuturism, then, would be the science fiction, fantasy and horror created by or featuring the children of the African diaspora (people of African origin living outside of the continent).\" Afrofuturism has more recently soared to commercial success with the release and critical acclaim of Black Panther.  The blockbuster movie broke several records, including highest-grossing film of 2018, third-highest-grossing film in the United States, and 10th-highest-grossing film of all time. It features an afrofuturistic superhero in a world where black people have the most advanced technology on Earth. \"That is afrofuturism at its best,\" Steven told Newsbeat.  \"You have something that deals with our past, our future, our present, our spirituality, our ability to love, to wield power, connections to family and language, and on and on and on and on.\" \"This is what I've been waiting for since I was child,\" he added. Contrary to science fiction's predominantly white history, the depiction of Black Panther on screen seems to have been exactly what the rest of the world had been waiting for too.  Congrats to the entire  #blackpanther  team! Because of you, young people will finally see superheroes that look like them on the big screen. I loved this movie and I know it will inspire people of all backgrounds to dig deep and find the courage to be heroes of their own stories. One of the best things you can do for yourself and\/or the ones you love is purchase some  #BlackPanther  tix. I know it\u2019s expensive to go to the theater, but its worth it for this one. You will exit forever impacted. BELIEVE. THE. HYPE. All hail the king  #WakandaForever   pic.twitter.com\/qENThMS9qU As the highest-grossing movie directed by a black filmmaker in North America, Black Panther's success (and 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) is indicative of a wider point about afrofuturism's appeal, and the desire for these stories to be told more broadly. In March, Black Panther became  the most tweeted about movie  of all time, according to Twitter Movies. The genre's importance in part comes from its ability to connect people of African descent not only to their origins, but to each other.  King Britt, a composer, producer and DJ, had been working on music before the term afrofuturism existed - but upon its conception he was surprised to find other people just like him. \"When the term and movement came to light, I was like, 'Oh wow, there are other black nerd kids like me who like sci-fi and want to change the future to include us more'. \"It was a form of escapism to think this way,\" he added. Steven Barnes, who teaches the subject, argues that afrofuturism's necessity comes from science fiction's history of excluding black people. \"You could have a movie where worlds collide and they build spaceships to save the world... and all the people on the spaceships are white,\" he told Newsbeat. \"The filmmakers didn't even question this, we literally don't exist in their fantasies. Now the situation is a lot better in a lot of ways.\" Afrofuturism may not be able to rectify an entire history of exclusion, but its impact, born of its attempts to answer important questions, is something that can't be ignored.  \"This is why we're having this conversation,\" Steven said.  \"The world is actually interested in the question.\" Follow Newsbeat on  Instagram ,  Facebook  and  Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"Cocoa, palm oil, pulp and paper, rubber, soy, timber, beef and leather. It's estimated that an area the size of the UK was used abroad every year between 2016 and 2018, to meet British demand for these natural materials. People everywhere rely on things like these for everyday products and our need for them in the UK could be making climate change worse. It's all to do with the trees cut down around the world to help make those products.  Globally it's thought deforestation is responsible for about 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  And according to the World Economic Forum, half of the world's tropical deforestation is illegal. Now the UK wants big businesses to have to  prove their brands aren't linked to illegal logging . Although some say the plan doesn't go far enough and it's not clear what the punishments would be if businesses don't do that. Conservationists think many of the countries those things are coming from, and the products themselves, are strongly linked to illegal deforestation. Chopping down trees to sell the timber, or to clear the land to produce something else there instead - without the right permission - is a multimillion-pound illegal industry. WWF claims about 28% of the land needed by the UK every year is in countries that are \"high risk\" or \"very high risk\" in terms of the threat to nature. That's an area about three times the size of Wales. The group also says nearly 3,000 species, already at risk of extinction, might be being affected by producing those materials. Ivory Coast is by far one of the biggest global suppliers of the cocoa used to make it. But the beans are grown in areas with the most deforestation and charities say there's even evidence of forests being cleared in protected areas. Cocoa traders don't say where their beans came from when they supply the UK market, so there's nothing to stop illegally produced cocoa being sold in the UK. Palm oil alone is in so much of what we use in the UK, including nearly half of the packaged products found in supermarkets.  It's made from the fruit of palm trees and it's where everyday items like pizzas, doughnuts, nut butters and cosmetics like shampoos, deodorants and toothpastes come into the mix. Indonesia is the world's biggest producer. But between 2011 and 2018, the country's West Kalimantan province lost enough trees cover to cover the size of Wales. Major palm oil traders who import into the UK source from a large number of mills. But less than 10% of these are certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The organisation wants global standards for sustainable palm oil. Some brands now promise to be totally free of palm oil. Trees can help prevent climate change by capturing and storing huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the air and carbon dioxide, (partly from humans burning fossil fuels), one of the major gasses contributing to rising global temperatures. But when the trees are cut down, and often burned, that carbon gets back into the atmosphere. Forests also create their create their own weather systems, circulating water and rain. If you take the trees away, it can lead to desertification.  Just look at the Sahara Desert, which 6000 years ago was a tropical jungle. As well as contributing to deforestation around the world, there are also worries that deforestation might be happening in the UK too. The Woodland Trust says it knows of at least 800 woods under threat and claims it's mostly down to building plans.  It's worried that the number of new woods being planted in place of those being cut down are \"seriously low\", despite an internationally binding agreement not to get into a state of deforestation.  The government tells Newsbeat its priority is to plant trees, not cut them down. \"We know trees are a precious natural asset and central to the fight against climate change, which is why we're committed to increasing tree planting across the UK to 30,000 hectares per year by 2025,\" says a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

{"id":null,"body":"During the last worldwide school strikes in March, BBC News asked for your questions on climate change.  Since then, thousands of you have been talking to our  climate change chatbot  on Facebook Messenger. Below are some of the topics that came up many times - with some answers from science and our climate team. You can chat to our climate bot  here . Humans are already adapting. In South Korea,  farmers are growing different crops  to future-proof themselves against changing temperatures. London's Thames Barrier was designed to help the city deal with an increasing risk of flooding. And the United Nations has made adaptation a key part of its strategy, alongside measures to curb rising global average temperatures. Under the Paris climate agreement, richer countries have agreed to help poorer nations by providing \"climate finance\" to help them adapt. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact. Cutting these from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds,  according to one Oxford study . Beef and lamb have a big environmental impact, as the digestive systems of livestock produce methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. The UN says we need to eat more locally-sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. How and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have very different impacts. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. Lots. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the world cannot meet its emissions targets without changes by individuals. It says: Research reported by the IPCC also  said  people tend to overestimate the energy-saving potential of lighting, and underestimate the energy used to heat water. It also says people don't think a lot about the energy used for the creation of products they buy. In 2013, the government  set out plans  for a consistent \"traffic light\" food labelling system to help people easily understand what's in their food. But we don't have a similar system for the carbon footprint or environmental impact. It would involve considering things such as air freight versus importing food by sea, the use of water in food production, as well as the impact on land and forests. Tesco did try it in 2007 - it started calculating the carbon footprint of every one of its 70,000 products. But five years later the supermarket gave up, saying it was \"a minimum of several months' work\" for each product. In 2007, Walkers Crisps  was the first  UK firm to put carbon footprint figures on its products. But the company confirmed to the BBC that it has since removed them. Human-induced climate change is happening. And  the UN estimates  the world has added approximately one billion humans since 2005. But depending on where in the world you live - and your lifestyle - a person's emissions can be very different. Generally, people living in countries like the UK depend heavily on fossil fuels. According to  one study , having one fewer child is the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your emissions. But this result is contentious and leads to many philosophical and ethical questions which we're not going to wade into here. Like, if you are responsible for your children's emissions, are your parents responsible for yours? Individual governments are choosing to tackle climate change in various ways. But the one thing that has pulled the world together is the Paris agreement. The deal has united nearly 200 countries in a single agreement on tackling climate change for the first time ever. Nations pledged to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and \"endeavour to limit\" them even more, to 1.5C. However, scientists point out that the agreement must be stepped up if it is to have any chance of curbing dangerous climate change. Global temperatures rises are generally compared to \"pre-industrial times\". Many researchers define that as 1850-1900 - before the world was chugging out greenhouse gases on a global scale. The world is now about 1C warmer than it was back then, according to the IPCC. For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts. But scientists now argue that keeping below 1.5C is a far safer limit for the world. It's hard to know much hotter the world will get. But if current trends continue,  the World Meteorological Organization says  temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100. Covering climate change and its impact on people around the world is a top priority for BBC News.  We know climate change is an increasingly important subject. Younger audiences in particular tell us they would like to see more journalism on the issue, the BBC says. There has been a significant increase in the number and range of stories across our output.  This includes prominent coverage of the latest scientific research, extreme weather events, climate protests, how climate change is affecting people's lives and the search for solutions to this enormous global challenge.  These stories are resonating with our audiences and it is a subject we are committed to covering in depth across BBC News. Being climate conscious can often feel very expensive, from changing your food habits to buying an electric car. But there are some things that will save you money - like eating wonky vegetables instead of red meat and cycling to work instead of driving. And\u00a0making your home more energy efficient should actually bring down your bills.

{"id":null,"body":"By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent, BBC News  Scientists have published the first assessment quantifying the role of climate change in the recent Australian bushfires. Global warming boosted the risk of the hot, dry weather that's likely to cause bushfires by at least 30%, they say. But the study suggests the figure is likely to be much greater. It says that if global temperatures rise by 2C, as seems likely, such conditions would occur at least four times more often. The analysis has been carried out by the World Weather Attribution consortium. Co-author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt, The Netherlands, told the BBC even the study's very conservative estimates were troubling. \"Last year the fire prevention system in Australia, which is extremely well prepared for bushfires, was straining. It was at the limits of what it could handle, with volunteers working for weeks on end,\" said Prof van Oldenborgh. \"As the world warms, these events will become more likely and more common. And it's not something that we are ready for.\" During the 2019-2020 fire season in Australia, record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought fuelled  a series of massive bushfires across the country. At least 33 people were killed and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia burned. Although it makes sense that human-induced global warming is likely to have led to more bushfires, assigning a figure to that increased risk is complex.  That is because other factors not directly related to climate change may also play a significant role. These include increased water use making the land drier, urban heating effects or unknown local factors. Nevertheless, Prof Jan van Oldenborgh and 17 fellow climate scientists from six countries gave it their best shot. \"It was by far the most complex study we have undertaken,\" he told the BBC.  The researchers found the climate models consistently underestimated the observed increase in temperatures in south-east Australia and so could not pinpoint a figure for the increased risk from climate change. They were, however, able to tease out a minimum risk. \"We show that climate change definitely increases the risk of the extreme weather that makes the catastrophic bush fires (that south-east Australia has experienced) in the past few months more likely by at least 30%.  \"But we think it could be much more. We don't know how much more. It could be a lot more.\" This video can not be played Prof van Oldenborgh is among those attempting to find out if the current climate computer models really are underestimating the influence of global warming - and if they are, working out how to correct them. His co-author Prof Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, said such work was needed to build a more accurate picture of the risk of bush fires.  \"We have only given a lower bound in answer to that question, confirming that climate change is indeed an important driver - also locally - and that we need to continue to test our models in the real world,\" she explained. This would \"improve them so we can provide higher-confidence risk information at the scales where people live and make decisions\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Climate change can still be tackled \u2013 but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says. The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints. The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain. And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered. Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue. The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies. Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually.  This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person. Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows. It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don\u2019t cut emissions by as much. The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: \u201cWe need a complete change of mindset.  \u201cWe have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear \u2013 then make good lives within those boundaries. \u201cThe top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.\u201d  Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved. Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most.  She said: \u201cAll the world suffers from climate change, but it\u2019s not the average person who flies regularly \u2013 it\u2019s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It\u2019s a moral issue.\u201d In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth. Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes.  Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy.  Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year. Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US. The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova. Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don\u2019t. Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: \u201cThis is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries. Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.\u201d   \u201cBetter design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren\u2019t necessarily covered by this study.\u201d  Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The vast majority of emissions cuts from electric cars will be wiped out by new road-building, a report says. The government says vehicle emissions per mile will fall as zero-emissions cars take over Britain\u2019s roads. But the report says the 80% of the CO2 savings from clean cars will be negated by the \u00a327bn planned roads programme. It adds that if ministers want a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d the cash would be better spent on public transport, walking, cycling, and remote-working hubs. And they point out that the electric cars will continue to increase local air pollution through  particles eroding from brakes and tyres. The calculations have been made by an environmental consultancy, Transport for Quality of Life, using data collected by Highways England. The paper estimates that a third of the predicted increase in emissions would come from construction - including energy for making steel, concrete and asphalt. A third would be created by increased vehicle speeds on faster roads. And a further third would be caused by extra traffic generated by new roads stimulating more car-dependent housing, retail parks and business parks. Its authors say history shows that building roads almost always generates more traffic. The report says even with the government\u2019s most optimistic estimate of the adoption rate for electric vehicles, emissions from trunk roads and motorways in England are not on track to meet \u201cnet zero\u201c by 2050.  A government spokesperson told BBC News the report is based on old data. \u201cThis assessment is wholly incorrect and doesn\u2019t take into account the benefits from the massive surge in electric vehicles,\" he said. \"The Road Investment Strategy is consistent with our ambition to improve air quality and decarbonise transport.\" The report\u2019s lead author, Lynn Sloman, said the electric car revolution would happen too slowly for transport to achieve the UK's carbon-cutting goals. \u201cIf we are to meet the legally-binding carbon budgets, we need to make big cuts in carbon emissions over the next decade,\" she said. \"That will require faster adoption of electric cars - but it will also require us to reduce vehicle mileage by existing cars. \u201cUnfortunately, the Government\u2019s \u00a327 billion road programme will make things worse, not better.\u201d The government accepts  that overall mileage should be cut. But it says the impact of the new roads programme on emissions will be a fraction of the report\u2019s predicted figure. The AA president, Edmund King, supports some road-building. He told BBC News said: \u201cWe believe post-lockdown that more people will continue to work from home,  drive less and cycle and walk more.  \u201cBut even with investment in broadband and active travel, we will still need road investment - particularly to overcome the congestion hotspots to help get our goods to market.\u201d Ms Sloman, who works regularly as a consultant for the Department for Transport, responded: \u201cMore roads just mean more cars. Decades of road investment have not solved congestion.  \u201cSustained lobbying for more money for roads, leaving less for public transport, cycling and walking, is one of the reasons we now face a climate emergency. We can\u2019t afford any more to indulge this Toad of Toad Hall model of mindless road-building.\u201d She also says the government can't ignore the continuing air pollution that will be caused by particles from the brakes and tyres of electric cars. This pollution could actually be increased if the fashion for heavy battery-powered SUVs continues. Ms Sloman said: \"This is an institutional problem. There are people in the Department for Transport and Highways England who have built their careers on big road building budgets, and they won't easily give them up.  \u201cBut there are also some officials - and perhaps some politicians - who are starting to recognise that the climate emergency means we need a radically different approach to transport.\" The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a decarbonisation strategy, and will publish its plan later in the year.

After taking a year-long break from education to try and force world leaders to take action on climate change, Greta has returned to class. She posted a picture on Instagram with the caption \"My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again!\"    My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again! A post shared by   Greta Thunberg  (@gretathunberg) on  Aug 24, 2020 at 8:36am PDT Greta's been busy in the last twelve months by anyone's standards, but what exactly has she been up to and how much impact has her work had? This video can not be played Plenty of students on a gap year enjoy a nice boat trip, but not quite like this one. Her break from the classroom started in August 2019 with a  3,000-mile (4,800km) voyage across the Atlantic. Then aged 16, she sailed from Plymouth to New York on a zero-emissions yacht, to speak at UN climate summits in New York City and Chile. and she wanted to make sure the carbon footprint of her travel was as small as possible. \"Our war on nature must end,\" she said after arriving in the Big Apple.  This video can not be played While in the US, Greta  spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit . It was a speech that demanded action, and she told the audience: \"I shouldn't be up here.\" \"I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, \"Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\" Greta also bumped into US President Donald Trump, but didn't appear to be his biggest fan. This video can not be played From the USA, to Canada - where Greta  led a rally as part of the Global Climate Strike in Montreal.  Hundreds of thousands of people joined marches across Canada, and almost a hundred other events took place in cities and towns across the world.  It all started with school strikes, inspired by Greta's  \"Fridays for Future\"  movement. Officials in Montreal said around 315,000 people gathered, making it one of the most attended environmental marches in history.  She also  called out her social media critics. \"The haters are as active as ever\", she said.  \"Going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences\". Anything, she says, rather than talk about the climate crisis.\" This video can not be played Greta had stayed in the Americas to speak at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which had been due to take place in Chile. Because of big civil unrest there  it was moved to Spain,  but Greta wasn't about to grab her boarding pass and hop on the next flight. Instead, after making a social media appeal for a lift across the Atlantic she was offered a ride by a family of  YouTubers who post videos about their journey around the world. \"We need to work together to make sure that we secure future living conditions for humankind, and that we fight for not only ourselves, but for our children and for our grandchildren and for every single living being on Earth,\" she told the crowd after arriving. At the start of 2020, Greta guest-edited the UK's second most listened to breakfast show, BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, which the  BBC turned in to a special podcast,. . In January she joined the most powerful economic leaders on the planet at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.  It was there she once again caught the attention of President Trump.  Both spoke at the convention , but their message couldn't be further apart.  In March it was another big meeting, the European Parliament's Environment Committee, where she  criticised the EU's plan for tackling climate change , telling Members of European Parliament it amounts to \"surrender\".  And not even a global pandemic could stop Greta's protests. In March she announced plans for a \"Digital Strike\".  School strike week 82.

At the end of 2019, science magazine  The New Scientist said that 2019 was the year the public \"finally woke up to climate change,\"  largely thanks to the work of Greta and the Extinction Rebellion protest group. Major politicians, like UK Environment secretary Michael Gove and former Labour leader Ed Miliband have  praised the impact of her work , often known as  \"The Greta Effect.\" And perhaps most significantly, Greta shared a stage with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, where  he promised billions would be spent on tackling climate change .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The searing July heatwave that hit Europe last week was made both more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change, scientists say. A  rapid attribution study  says that heating added up to 3C to the intensity of the event that scorched the UK, France and the Netherlands.  In France, the heatwave was made at least 10 times and up to 100 times more likely by human activities. The shorter event in the UK was made at least twice as likely, experts say. The  World Weather Attribution Group  has carried out a number of similar studies in recent years to work out the impact of climate change on extreme events.  This new report looks at the July heatwave that saw temperatures soar above 40C in many countries including Belgium, France and the Netherlands.   In Paris, the mercury smashed through a historic high of 40.4C. It beat the record by more than 2 degrees, to the new mark of 42.6C. In the UK, the heat event only lasted 1-2 days but  a new record was set  at Cambridge University's botanic garden with 38.7C.   Researchers combined information from both long term temperature observations and climate models to look at how the events would have unfolded with or without the human influence on the climate.  Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the world So when they look at France they can say that the chances of having a heatwave like the one that struck last week were made more likely by at least a factor of 10, but could in fact have been up to 100 times. \"We conclude that such an event would have had an extremely small probability to occur (less than about once every 1,000 years) without climate change in France,\" the study says.  The picture across Europe was the same say researchers.  \"Every European heatwave we and others have analysed was found to be made much more likely and more intense due to human-induced climate change, so it was not surprising that climate change played a role,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.  \"But how much more likely the heatwave is depends very strongly on the event definition: location, season, intensity and duration. This July 2019 heatwave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change.\"   The researchers say the intensity of the heatwave was increased by between 1.5 and 3C. \"When I bicycled home from work last week it was still 37.1 degrees,\" said co-author Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, from KNMI in the Netherlands. \"I would have felt a difference at 34C - you don't need a thermometer anymore to notice a difference.\"  While the event lasted little more than a day in the UK, the researchers estimate that climate change made it at least twice as likely. The impact on intensity was estimated to be between 1.5 and 2.5C. The researchers also talk about the likely return period of these events - meaning the chances of having another one of the same magnitude. For Cambridge they estimate it's 30 years.  \"A return period of 30 years like in Cambridge, means that every year in the current climate you have about 3% chance of having a heatwave like that,\" says Dr van Oldenborgh.  \"It was much smaller in the old climate and every year that we keep on emitting CO2 the probability of having a heatwave like that will just increase.\" One problem that the researchers keep encountering when they carry out these rapid attribution studies is the fact that the climate models they are using underestimate the high temperature observations that are being made in the real world.  \"We know for 10 years or so that the models have problems with these relatively short, very intense events,\" says Geert Jan van Oldenborgh. \"They have been designed to simulate global mean temperatures and large scale heat patterns, they have not been designed to get heatwaves right.  \"Everybody now agrees that this needs to be figured out, because the trend in heatwaves is just so much higher than the model trend.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Researchers say that carbon dioxide emissions this year have risen slightly, despite a drop in the use of coal. The Global Carbon Project's annual analysis of emission trends suggests that CO2 will go up by 0.6% in 2019. The rise is due to continuing strong growth in the utilisation of oil and gas.  Since the Paris agreement was set out in 2015, CO2 emissions have risen by 4%. Last year saw a strong rise in emissions of almost 3%, with strong demand for coal in China being the main factor. There was also a surge in demand for oil, driven by a booming global market for cars, particularly SUVs. This year's modest rise, if indeed it is a rise, as the margin of error is large, reflects some significant changes in the demand for fossil fuels.  While global emissions from coal use fell by less than 1%, this masks some huge drops in countries like the US and across the European Union. \"Through most of 2019 it was looking as if coal use would grow globally, but weaker than expected economic performance in China and India, and a record hydropower year in India - caused by a strong monsoon - quickly changed the prospects for growth in coal use,\" said Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Research, part of the Global Carbon Project. \"Coal use in both the US and the EU28 has dropped substantially, possibly by as much as 10% in both regions in 2019 alone, helping push down global coal consumption,\" Mr Andrew said. The drop in coal as a source of energy was offset by the continued rise of oil and gas.  The data comes as the COP25 climate summit continues in Madrid amid a growing sense of crisis. This video can not be played Gas use rose by a robust 2.6%, and while renewable sources like wind and solar have also grown substantially, according to the authors the greener fuels have merely slowed the rise in the growth of fossil fuel emissions. \"Compared to coal, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel, but unabated natural gas use merely cooks the planet more slowly than coal,\" said Dr Glen Peters, also from Cicero. According to the Global Carbon Project researchers, the continuing use of fossil fuel-based technology is threatening the targets that countries have set for themselves in the Paris climate agreement.  \"This is still not good news this year, as the emissions are still going up, the emissions are going more slowly, so we are making progress but the actions need to be higher in terms of implementing renewable energy and removing those tech that produce CO2,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia (UEA), another author of the research. There are some interesting developments on a country level in the emissions data.  US emissions have declined by around 1% per year every year since 2005. That trend continued in 2019. Even with President Trump's favourable policies towards fossil fuels, cheap gas, wind and solar are replacing coal. This video can not be played China's emissions are expected to rise up by 2.6% but would have been higher if it wasn't for slower economic growth and a weaker demand for electricity. Similarly in India, slower economic growth has seen a much smaller rise in emissions expected to be 1.8% compared to the normal recent rate of 5.1%. The figures show just how far back the world is in terms of meeting the goals of cutting carbon quickly to avoid dangerous temperature rises. \"There are lots of countries now that are ramping up their policies on climate change but still not big enough,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. \"There's not enough countries making commitments. The big emitters are still awaited at the table - so 2020 will be a really big year for countries on climate change.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new analysis, seen by the BBC, suggests the goals of the UN Paris climate agreement are getting \"within reach.\" The  Climate Action Tracker  group looked at new climate promises from China and other nations, along with the carbon plans of US President-elect Joe Biden. These commitments would mean the rise in world temperatures could be held to 2.1C by the end of this century. Previous estimates indicated up to 3C of heating, with disastrous impacts. But the experts are worried the long-term optimism is not matched by short-term plans to cut CO2. For more than a decade, researchers from the Climate Action Tracker have kept a close eye on what countries' collective carbon-cutting pledges mean for our warming world.  After the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009, the group estimated that global temperatures would rise by 3.5C by the end of this century.  But the creation in 2015 of the Paris climate agreement, which was designed to avoid dangerous warming of the Earth, made a considerable impact. As a result of the international deal, countries slowly started to switch away from fossil fuels.  In September this year, the group concluded that the world was heading for warming of around 2.7C by 2100. This figure was still far above the 2C goal contained in the wording of the Paris pact, and nowhere near the more challenging 1.5C target that  scientists endorsed as the threshold to destructive warming in 2018 .  Their new \"optimistic analysis\" now suggests a rise of 2.1C by 2100. This video can not be played The past three months have seen some key developments.  In September, China's President Xi Jinping  told the UN that his country will reach net zero emissions by 2060 , and that its emissions will peak before 2030. According to the CAT researchers, this could reduce warming by 0.2 to 0.3C by the end of the century.  Japan and South Korea have both  followed suit , pledging to reach net zero by 2050. South Africa and Canada have also announced their own net zero targets.  The other significant change is the election of Joe Biden in the US. Tackling climate change is a  major part of his agenda . He has promised to bring the US to net zero emissions by 2050. That move would reduce global temperatures by 0.1C by 2100. \"We now have north of 50% of global emissions covered by big countries with a zero emissions by mid-century goal,\" said Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, who helped lead the Climate Action Tracker analysis. \"When you add all that up, along with what a whole bunch of other countries are doing, then you move the temperature dial from around 2.7C to really quite close to two degrees.\"  \"It's still a fair way off from the Paris Agreement target, but it is a really major development,\" he told BBC News.  The CAT researchers say they have taken a fairly conservative approach but they readily acknowledge that their optimistic analysis comes with some major caveats.  The biggest problem as they see it, is that the near-term plans to cut carbon by 2030 are just not up to the job. \"Countries have not yet adjusted their short-term actions to be on a pathway towards the long-term target,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, from the NewClimate Institute, who also works on the Climate Action Tracker.  \"Long-term targets are easier, they are far away. But short-term actions are happening right now and they affect citizens, they affect voters. And that's why this is much more difficult,\" he told BBC News.  The countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement are expected to lodge new carbon-cutting plans for 2030 by the end of this year.  It's expected that a number will do so, including the UK and the EU. But there are several countries who are still reluctant to set goals, and many poorer nations are still looking to invest in coal.  \"There are countries that still remain bad actors, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Australia, Russia, and a few others,\" said Bill Hare.  \"And we also have a pipeline of coal plants in the region where I'm working now in Asia. It has not collapsed, it has not gone away, so yes, there's much to be concerned about. And there's much that can go wrong.\" According to observers, the response of countries to the Covid crisis is a huge opportunity to focus their short-term spending on renewable energy and increased decarbonisation. \"The pandemic opened a window to not only get countries to outline their long-term goal, but to actually move onto the right path so that they can actually achieve the long term goal,\" said Dr Maisa Rojas, who is the director of the Center for Climate and Resilience Research at the University of Chile in Santiago. \"Are we going to harness that opportunity? My impression is that many, including the EU, are harnessing it.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst A tiny spark in the UK\u2019s hydrogen revolution has been lit \u2013 at a university campus near Stoke-on-Trent. Hydrogen fuel is a relatively green alternative to alternatives that produce greenhouse gases. The natural gas supply at Keele University is being blended with 20% hydrogen in a trial that's of national significance. Adding the hydrogen will reduce the amount of CO2 that\u2019s being produced through heating and cooking. Critics fear hydrogen will prove too expensive for mass usage, but supporters of the technology have high hopes.  Using natural gas for heating generates about a third of the UK emissions that are driving global warming. But the only product of burning hydrogen is water. As a fuel, hydrogen functions in much the same way as natural gas. So staff in the university canteen say cooking on the 20% hydrogen blend has made no difference to their cooking regime. The project \u2013 known as HyDeploy - is the UK\u2019s first live trial of hydrogen in a modern gas network. Keele was chosen because it has a private gas system. Its hydrogen is produced in an electrolyser - a device that splits water (H2O) into its constituents: hydrogen and oxygen. The machine is located in a glossy green shipping container in the corner of the university\u2019s sports field. The gas distribution firm Cadent, which is leading the project, says that if a 20% blend were to be rolled out across Britain, it would reduce emissions of CO2 by six million tonnes - equivalent to taking 2.5 million cars off the road.  The hydrogen could be generated pollution-free by using surplus wind power at night to split water molecules using electrolysis. The 20% proportion was chosen because it\u2019s an optimal blend that won\u2019t affect gas pipes and appliances. Currently, the UK has only small supplies of hydrogen, but the firm says increasing production would offer a quick way of cutting emissions from heating. Consultant engineer Ed Syson told BBC News: \u201cThe prize is a large one. If we were to roll this system out across the UK it would be on broadly the same scale as offshore wind is today. So it\u2019s a significant technology. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it makes those carbon savings without having customers change their behaviour in any way.\u201d Some boiler manufacturers are already producing prototype boilers that use 100% hydrogen.  Worcester Bosch, for instance, has a \u201chydrogen-ready\u201d design. It can run on natural gas, but it\u2019s capable of converting to 100% hydrogen following a one-hour visit by an engineer.  The firm wants the government to stipulate that by 2025, all new boilers on sale should be hydrogen-ready. It says this would allow households to switch painlessly to clean boilers when existing boilers reach the end of their lives. The extra cost of the hydrogen-ready boiler would be about \u00a350, it says. Hydrogen can be produced from water through electrolysis, or from natural gas. Electrolysis from surplus renewable energy is unambiguously beneficial for the environment \u2013 but it\u2019s not very efficient.  For the foreseeable future it may be cheaper to produce hydrogen from natural gas. However, CO2 is released in the industrial process used to generate hydrogen. The resulting CO2 would need to be captured and stored underground with carbon capture and storage (CCS) - a technology not yet established at scale. About 85% of homes have gas central heating, and some experts believe it will prove more cost-effective to switch boilers to hydrogen, rather than to install heat pumps which would require the UK\u2019s aging housing stock to be highly insulated. A recent study for the government raised the possibility that homes could be warmed by a hybrid system  using electric heat pumps , then topping up with hydrogen on cold days.  Major drawbacks to hydrogen are cost and availability. The costs are much higher than for natural gas, although the differential will surely shrink as carbon taxes raise the price of burning gas to combat climate change over coming decades. The environmental think tank E3G said in a statement: \u201cGoing for hydrogen entails massive infrastructure expenditure. In many cases the additional costs make it look unattractive compared with alternatives (like renewables).  Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) told BBC News: \u201cWe will and should have hydrogen in the mix of energy options, but it\u2019s not a wonder solution to everything, which you sometimes get the impression from the rhetoric. There is hope \u2013 but too much hype.\u201d  Meanwhile, in the corner of a sports field in Keele, the container of hope has just supplied enough hydrogen to cook 20% of Christmas dinners.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A technology that removes carbon dioxide from the air has received significant backing from major fossil fuel companies. British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering has shown that it can extract CO2 in a cost-effective way. It has now been boosted by $68m in new investment from Chevron, Occidental and coal giant BHP. But climate campaigners are worried that the technology will be used to extract even more oil.   This video can not be played The quest for technology for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the air received significant scientific endorsement last year with the  publication of the IPCC report  on keeping the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C this century. In their  \"summary for policymakers\" , the scientists stated that: \"All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5C with limited or no overshoot project the use of CDR ...over the 21st century.\" Around the world, a number of companies are racing to develop the technology that can draw down carbon. Swiss company  Climeworks is already capturing CO2  and using it to boost vegetable production. Carbon Engineering says that its direct air capture (DAC) process is now able to capture the gas for under  $100 a tonne .  With its new funding, the company plans to build its first commercial facilities. These industrial-scale DAC plants could capture up to one million tonnes of CO2 from the air each year. CO2 is a powerful warming gas but there's not a lot of it in the atmosphere - for every million molecules of air, there are 410 of CO2.  While the CO2 is helping to drive temperatures up around the world, the comparatively low concentrations make it difficult to design efficient machines to remove the gas. Carbon Engineering's process is all about sucking in air and exposing it to a chemical solution that concentrates the CO2. Further refinements mean the gas can be purified into a form that can be stored or utilised as a liquid fuel.  Absolutely. Carbon Engineering's barn-sized installation has a large fan in the middle of the roof which draws in air from the atmosphere. It then comes into contact with a hydroxide-based chemical solution. Certain hydroxides react with carbon dioxide, reversibly binding to the CO2 molecule. When the CO2 in the air reacts with the liquid, it forms a carbonate mixture. That is then treated with a slurry of calcium hydroxide to change it into solid form; the slurry helps form tiny pellets of calcium carbonate.  The chalky calcium carbonate pellets are then treated at a high temperature of about 900C, with the pellets decomposing into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide. That stream of pure CO2 is cleaned up to remove water impurities.     \"The key to this process is about concentrating the CO2,\" said Carbon Engineering's Dr Jenny McCahill. \"We can then put it underground as in sequestration, or we can combine it with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons or methanol. There's a number of things you can do.\" Yes. It's complicated but it can be done.  The captured CO2 is mixed with hydrogen that's made from water and green electricity. It's then passed over a catalyst at 900C to form carbon monoxide. Adding in more hydrogen to the carbon monoxide turns it into what's called synthesis gas.  Finally a Fischer-Tropsch process turns this gas into a synthetic crude oil. Carbon Engineering says the liquid can be used in a variety of engines without modification. \"The fuel that we make has no sulphur in it, it has these nice linear chains which means it burns cleaner than traditional fuel,\" said Dr McCahill. \"It's nice and clear and ready to be used in a truck, car or jet.\" CO2 can also be used to flush out the last remaining deposits of oil in wells that are past their prime. The oil industry in the US has been using the gas in this way for decades.  It's estimated that using CO2 can deliver an extra 30% of crude from oilfields with the added benefit that the gas is then sequestered permanently in the ground.  \"Carbon Engineering's direct air capture technology has the unique capability to capture and provide large volumes of atmospheric CO2,\" said Occidental Petroleum's Senior Vice President, Richard Jackson, in a statement. \"This capability complements Occidental's enhanced oil recovery business and provides further synergies by enabling large-scale CO2 utilisation and sequestration.\" One of the other investors in Carbon Engineering is BHP, best known for its coal mining interests.  \"The reality is that fossil fuels will be around for several decades whether in industrial processes or in transportation,\" said Dr Fiona Wild, BHP's head of sustainability and climate change. \"What we need to do is invest in those low-emission technologies that can significantly reduce the emissions from these processes, and that's why we are focusing on carbon capture and storage.\"  Some climate campaigners are positive about the development of direct air capture technology, but others are worried that it will be used to prolong the fossil fuel era.  \"It's a huge concern,\" Tzeporah Berman, international programme director for Stand dot earth, told BBC News.    \"We need to be working together to figure out how we move away completely from fossil fuel - that's our moral and economic challenge but these technologies provide a false hope that we can continue to depend on fossil fuels and produce and burn them, and technology will fix it - we are way past that point!\" Others are concerned that the development of direct air capture devices may just encourage some people to think that they don't have to personally reduce their carbon footprint. \"I think there's a real danger that people will see this technology as a magic bullet and not cut back their carbon,\" said Shakti Ramkumar, a student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), who is active in climate change protests.  \"We have a moral responsibility to reduce our consumption on a large scale. We need to reflect deeply on how we live our lives and whether everyone can have access to the things we have, and fairness, so we can all live a good life.\"  It's impossible to say if Carbon Engineering's idea will emerge as the type of device that makes a major difference in the battle against climate change.  Certainly, the company believes that its machines could become as common as water treatment plants - providing a valuable service, yet hardly noticed by the general public.  Right now, it has secured enough money to build a commercial facility and can draw down carbon for less than $100 a tonne. But there is a big worry that with large investments from the fossil fuel industry, the focus of its efforts could be turned to producing more oil, not just tackling climate change. Carbon Engineering says that if governments want to invest in its process they are very welcome to do so. If they're not ready to stump up the cash, the company is happy to take funding from the energy industry as time is so short, and the need for the technology is so great.   \"Is it the silver bullet?\" asked CEO Steve Oldham. \"I would never say to anybody that you want to put all your eggs in one basket - the future of the planet is very important for us all. \"But having the technology built, available, ready to go, with no harmful chemical side-effects, less land-usage, having those available - that's a good thing. \"If or when we need them, and if you read the science that's today - it's available, it's ready.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"id":null,"body":"Leading climate scientists have called for Theresa May to make her \"legacy\" a target to cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. A group of experts have written to the prime minister calling for her to enshrine a target for \"net zero\" emissions in national law. Experts claim the target is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. The government said the UK already leads the world in tackling global warming. In their letter, the scientists said the evidence was \"unequivocal\" that avoiding dangerous climate change means eliminating or offsetting all carbon emissions - not just reducing them.   Among the signatories are emeritus professor Joanna Haigh from Imperial College London, Myles Allen from Oxford University, Sir Brian Hoskins, who chairs the Grantham Institute on Climate Change, and Professor Dame Julia Slingo, former chief scientist at the Met Office. They said Mrs May could make \"a powerful statement of global leadership\", which would compare to Margaret Thatcher's intervention 30 years ago when she became the first leader of a major nation to call for a United Nations climate change treaty. \"To do so would be an act of global importance for future generations, and a worthy legacy,\" they said. The current target written into law is to reduce greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.  Their letter comes after the government's independent climate advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, urged ministers to set a new legal target for a 100% cut in all greenhouse gases by the middle of the century as soon as possible.   Meeting this target would mean stopping all emissions from electricity generation, transport and heating, while offsetting pollution from areas like aviation using measures to capture carbon, such as planting trees, the committee said. A government spokesman said: \"We already lead the world in tackling climate change, being the first country to introduce long-term legally-binding carbon reduction targets and cutting emissions further than all other G20 countries.\" The spokesman said the government will respond to the Committee on Climate Change's zero-emissions recommendation \"in a timeframe which reflects the urgency of the issue\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The global response to Covid-19 has barely made a dent in the causes of climate change, according to a major new report.  While emissions of CO2 plummeted during lockdown, concentrations of the long-lasting gas have continued to rise in the atmosphere. The period from 2016 to 2020 will likely be the warmest five years on record, the study finds.  The authors say \"irreversible\" climate change impacts are increasing. The  United in Science report  brings together experts from a large number of international organisations, including the UN and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), to give an updated snapshot of the state of the global climate.  The study shows that global lockdowns had a significant and immediate impact on emissions of greenhouse gases, with daily levels in April 2020 falling by 17% compared with 2019. But this steep drop hasn't been maintained. As the world returned to work, emissions rose and by June were within 5% of the previous year. Over 2020, the expectation is that emissions will fall 4-7%. While emissions can tell us what is happening on the ground, it is the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere that makes all the difference for global temperatures.  Because CO2 can last for centuries, adding even a reduced amount to the air increases the warming potential of all the gas that has built up over decades. This new study shows that is exactly what's happened at a couple of key monitoring stations around the world.  At the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, the amount of CO2 measured in air samples has increased from 411 parts per million (ppm) in July 2019 to 414ppm in July this year.  Similarly, at Cape Grim monitoring station in Tasmania, concentrations were also up from 407 to 410ppm in the year to July. A full global picture on atmospheric concentrations of warming gases won't be available until later this year - but experts say the direction of travel is clear.  \"Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in three million years - have continued to rise,\" said WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas. \"Meanwhile, large swathes of Siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heatwave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic climate change. \"And now 2016-2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. This report shows that whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,\" he said. The report also highlights the growing gap between the action that's needed to keep under temperature thresholds and the reality of efforts to cut emissions.  To keep the world from going beyond 1.5C of warming (since preindustrial times) this century, greenhouse gas production needs to be slashed, urgently.  The study says that by 2030, the world would need to cut the combined emissions of the top six carbon-producing countries to have a reasonable chance of staying below the 1.5C \"guard rail\".   While not impossible, the report says it would essentially require a pandemic-sized carbon slowdown every year from now until the end of the decade.  All the while, the authors say, the evidence of the impacts of climate change continues to grow. Global sea levels are rising much faster than previously recorded. Between 2016 and 2020 the rate of increase was 4.8mm per year, an increase over the 4.1mm recorded between 2011 and 2015. The extent of sea-ice in the Arctic has continued to decline, at a rate of 13% per decade.  Rising temperatures have also seen droughts and heatwaves and have increased the risk of wildfires.  In Siberia, a recent attribution study has shown that the heat that persisted between January and June this year was made at least 600 times more likely by human-driven climate change. \"Never before has it been so clear that we need long-term, inclusive, clean transitions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve sustainable development,\" said UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, in a foreword to the report. \"We must turn the recovery from the pandemic into a real opportunity to build a better future,\" he wrote. \"We need science, solidarity and solutions.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg and Helen Briggs BBC News Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the  West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming .  But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer?  To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. \r\n                  Update your browser to have a go! All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator,  click to launch the interactive content . Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush. Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a  University of Oxford study. However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.  Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.  Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment. The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel. Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.  \"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News. Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said. \"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.  If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.  Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land. Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference. Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases. For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles. Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts. University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and  Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland,  looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.  They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.  By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet. The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.  For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on  serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA)  and  healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA . The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often  lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants  and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.  Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods. The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.  The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.  These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The  European Environment Agency  estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq\/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile. Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the  Committee on Climate Change , and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The World Meteorological Organisation says there's a growing chance that global temperatures will break the 1.5C threshold over the next five years, compared to pre-industrial levels.  It says there's a 20% possibility the critical mark will be broken in any one year before 2024. But the assessment says there's a 70% chance it will be broken in one or more months in those five years. Scientists say that keeping below 1.5C will avoid the worst climate impacts. The target was agreed by world leaders in the 2015 Paris climate accord accord. They committed to pursue efforts to try to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C this century.  This new assessment, carried out by the UK's Met Office for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), says there's a growing chance that this level will be breached. Researchers say that the Earth's average annual temperature is already more than 1C higher than it was in the 1850s - and will probably stay around this level over the next five years.  Previous studies  had put the short-term chances of going above 1.5C at 10% - that's now doubled say the climate modellers, and it's increasing with time.  Some parts of the world will feel this rising heat more than others, with the scientists saying that the Arctic will probably warm by twice the global average this year. They also predict that over the coming five years there will be more storms over western Europe thanks to rising sea levels. 20% chance average annual temperatures increase +1.5\u00b0C by 2024 70% chance 1.5\u00b0C threshold broken in one or more months by 2024 1.5\u00b0C threshold uses pre-industrial temperatures as a comparison The assessment considers natural variability as well as the impact of carbon emissions from human activities - however the models don't take account of the fall-off in CO2 emissions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  The WMO says this is unlikely to affect temperatures in the early 2020s. \"The WMO has repeatedly stressed that the industrial and economic slowdown from Covid-19 is not a substitute for sustained and co-ordinated climate action,\" said Prof Petteri Taalas, the WMO's secretary general.  \"Due to the very long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases. \"Whilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries. Governments should use the opportunity to embrace climate action as part of recovery programmes and ensure that we grow back better,\" he said. If the 1.5C threshold is broken in one of the coming years, the experts stress it won't mean the targets are invalid.  However it will, once again, underline the urgency of significant emissions cuts to prevent a long-term move to this more dangerous, warmer world.  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The dramatic drop in greenhouse gases and air pollutants seen during the global lockdown will have little impact on our warming planet say scientists. Their new analysis suggests that by 2030, global temperatures will only be 0.01C lower than expected.  But the authors stress that the nature of the recovery could significantly alter the longer term outlook. A strong green stimulus could keep the world from exceeding 1.5C of warming by the middle of this century. Previous studies have already established  that there were significant changes to greenhouse gas emissions as transport systems shut down around the world in response to the pandemic.  Global daily emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the crisis. The new study builds on these findings by using global mobility data from Google and Apple. Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, who led the study, worked with his daughter Harriet on the research, when her A-Level exams were cancelled.  With other researchers, they calculated how 10 different greenhouse gases and air pollutants changed between February and June 2020 in 123 countries. They found that the drop off peaked in April, with CO2, nitrogen oxides and other emissions falling between 10-30% globally, mainly due to declines in surface transport. But this new work shows that some of the declines in greenhouse gases actually cancelled each other out in terms of warming.  Nitrogen oxides from transport normally have a warming impact in the atmosphere.  While they went down by 30%, they were matched by a drop in sulphur dioxide, which mainly comes from the burning of coal.  Emissions of this gas help aerosols to form, which reflect sunlight back into space and cool the planet.  This balancing out, combined with the temporary nature of the pandemic restrictions, mean the impact on warming by 2030 will hardly be felt. \"Although temporary changes can help, you need to reduce CO2 permanently to make a dent in global warming,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds.   \"CO2 is long lived in the atmosphere, so you effectively need to reduce emissions to zero for a long-time before you begin to cancel out the effects from decades of past emissions.\" Harriet Forster, who co-authored the paper with her father, said that while the recent impacts won't last, there is a golden opportunity for governments to change course. \"Our paper shows that the actual effect of lockdown on the climate is small. The important thing to recognise is that we've been given a massive opportunity to boost the economy by investing in green industries - and this can make a huge difference to our future climate,\" she explained. Right now, road traffic is still down in many countries say the authors, with the Google data showing all modes of UK transport still 25% or so down, while the official UK government data has cars still 12% down, but with buses and trains running at less than 50%. The research team says that if transport goes back to what it was, and the world strongly invests in fossil fuels during the recovery, there is a very high probability that the world will go above the 1.5C warming threshold by 2050. But if the recovery is strongly green, avoids fossil fuel lock-ins and bail outs, and cuts global emissions to net zero by 2050, the world would have around a 55% chance of staying under 1.5C by the middle of the century. So what needs to be done to help that happen? Study co-author Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia says there are a number of steps that should now be taken. \"In cities, it is to support cycling and walking (including electric bikes) because this has multiple benefits for climate, for reducing air pollution, and for health,\" she told BBC News. \"Encouraging remote working until social distancing measures are lifted releases the pressure on public transport, which can continue to be used. As soon as possible all cars will need to be electric.\" \"The economic stimulus post-Covid could greatly help support that change in the car manufacturing industry towards the production of electric cars alone.\"  Prof Forster is optimistic that the challenge can be met.  \"Disasters are often historically the time of biggest change,\" he said. \"For once government, industry and public voices are all pretty aligned that green jobs and green investments are the way to build back better.\"  \"We just need to do it.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Climate Change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst New rules could spell the death of a \"throwaway\" culture in which products are bought, used briefly, then binned. The regulations will apply to a range of everyday items such as mobile phones, textiles, electronics, batteries, construction and packaging. They will ensure products are designed and manufactured so they last - and so they're repairable if they go wrong.  It should mean that your phone lasts longer and proves easier to fix. That may be especially true if the display or the battery needs changing.  It's part of a worldwide movement called the Right to Repair, which has spawned  citizens' repair workshops in several UK cities. The plan is being presented by the European Commission. It's likely to create standards for the UK, too - even after Brexit. That's because it probably won't be worthwhile for manufacturers to make lower-grade models that can only be sold in Britain. It's all part of what one green group is calling the most ambitious and comprehensive proposal ever put forward to reduce the environmental and climate impact of the things we use and wear. Proposals aim at making environmentally-friendly products the norm. It could mean manufacturers using screws to hold parts in place, rather than glue. The rules will also fight what is known as \"premature obsolescence\", the syndrome in which manufacturers make goods with deliberately low lifespan to force consumers into buying a newer model. One green group, the European Environment Bureau (EEB), said: \"The strategy is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the way we manufacture, use and dispose of our products in a way that benefits people and the planet.\" It urges Europe's politicians to turn the plans into reality.  The EU also wants to set a food waste reduction target, end over-packaging, and curb microplastic pollution. Other recommendations under the proposals, known as the Circular Economy Action Plan, are: The idea is to encourage manufacturers to make sure things don't break - because they'll have to pick up the bill for repair or replacement. The new rules take a step further than previous narrower regulations aimed at securing the repair-ability of \"white goods\" such as fridges and washing machines.   But the EEB complains that the package should go even further by setting waste prevention targets for businesses and industries, and setting goals for reducing resource use overall across Europe. The new EU package may restore some of the block's reputation for environmental leadership following  condemnation of last week's climate package.  Certainly the tone of the document strikes a green note. It begins: \"There is only one planet Earth, yet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three.\"  It notes: \"Many products break down too quickly, cannot be easily reused, repaired or recycled, and many are made for single-use only.\" This video can not be played The report says global consumption of materials such as biomass (plant material), fossil fuels, metals and minerals is expected to double in the next 40 years. And it says half of total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress come from resource extraction and processing. The measures will need to be agreed by member states and MEPs. But they are likely to be under pressure to act from their own citizens  who don't appear to appreciate the throwaway society.

{"id":null,"body":"By Caroline Parkinson Health editor, BBC News website, Berlin Growing fruit and veg in the garden is already seen as environmentally friendly, but it could also be a weapon in the fight against climate change. That's been the experience of a community in Bangladesh, whose rice crop - the source of their food and income - was ruined when seasonal rains came early. It was in April 2017 that the rain came to the north-eastern floodplain of Sylhet Division, ruining the rice crop. It should have come two months later. Farmers lost most or all of their harvest, It meant no income - and not enough food - for their families. Scientists warn that climate change is affecting the crops people can grow and the nutrients they get in their food. Sabine Gabrysch, professor for climate change and health at the Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: \"It's so unfair because these people have not contributed anything to climate change.\" Speaking to the BBC at a conference of health and climate experts in Berlin, organised by the  Nobel Foundation , Prof Gabrysch said: \"They're very directly hit by climate change, because then they lose their livelihoods and they lose their nutrients. And their children are suffering most, because they're growing fast and they need many nutrients.\" Even before the early rains, she said, a third of women were underweight and 40% of children chronically undernourished.  \"People are already at the brink of existence where they suffer from many diseases and they don't have much to buffer,\" Prof Gabrysch added. \"They have no insurance.\"  She  is leading a study into the impact of the floods  in Sylhet Division, and is working with more than 2,000 women in villages across the area, Half said their families were significantly affected by the flood. The most common way they tried to cope was to borrow money, mainly from money lenders who were charging high interest rates, and families then fell into debt. The team had already begun educating the community to grow their own food in their gardens, on higher ground, where they could grow a more nutritionally varied crop of fruit and vegetables, and keep chickens. Prof Gabrysch  said: \"I don't think it can compensate for the loss of the rice crop honestly, because that's their livelihood, but at least it can help them to some degree.\" But even when rice - and the other starchy foods that people in developing countries rely on - grows well, climate change can mean it is not as nutritious as it was. Prof Kristie Ebi, from the department of Global Health at the University of Washington, has studied levels of nutrients. She has found crops like rice, wheat, potatoes and barley now have higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. That means they need less water to grow, which is not as positive as it might sound, because it means they take up fewer micronutrients from the soil.  Research by Prof Ebi's team found rice crops they studied had, on average, a 30% reduction in B vitamins - including folic acid, crucial for pregnant women - compared to normal levels, She said: \"Even today in Bangladesh, as the country becomes wealthier, three out of four calories come from rice. \"In many countries, people eat a lot of the starches as a main component of their diet. So having less micronutrients could have very significant consequences.\" And she warns that a warming world also means diseases are on the move. \"There are major risks from diseases that are carried by mosquitoes. And there's major risk from diarrheal diseases, and infectious diseases. \"As our planet warms, these diseases are changing their geographic range, their seasons becoming longer. There's more transmission of these diseases.  \"And many of these primarily affect children. That's why we're so concerned about what this means for maternal and child health, because they're on the front line. They're the ones who are seeing the consequences.\"  Diseases traditionally seen as tropical are moving north. This year,  Germany saw the first cases of West Nile virus , which is carried by mosquitoes. Sabine Gabrysch said: \"The infectious disease spread is something that makes people realise climate change is also coming to us.\" Nobel Laureate Peter Agre warns that climate change means diseases are moving - with some not seen in the places they had been established, and others appearing in new places - in particular moving to higher altitudes as temperatures rise,  something that has been seen South America and Africa. That matters because people living in the tropics have traditionally lived at higher altitudes in order to avoid disease. Prof Agre, who was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in chemistry, warned there should be no complacency, and as temperatures warmed diseases would move. \"The famous phrase is 'it can't happen here'.

{"id":null,"body":"By Judith Burns Education reporter \"It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,\" says sixth-former Joe Brindle.  Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education.  Ministers agree \"it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change\" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency. He is a founder member of  Teach the Future  which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.   \"It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,\" says Joe.  \"And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse.\"  On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs.  The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes \"is going to be really big\".  Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is \"to get MPs on our side\".  The idea is based on the  1958 US National Defense Education Act  which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races.  It paid off - by July 1969,  the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28 .  \"I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,\" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer.  But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes.  \"The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences.\"  He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and \"try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can\".  And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says.  People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: \"It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.\" Joe believes most people his age \"want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it\".  But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.   \"It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,\" say the campaigners.  They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector.  The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are \"particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there\". Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030.  The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception.  In a statement, the government said: \"It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish. \"This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.\" A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.  The Department for Education also supports energy efficiency through its capital funding programmes, including interest-free loans, the spokesperson added.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst, Geneva Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, UN experts have said. A major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming. But scientists and officials stopped short of explicitly calling on everyone to become vegan or vegetarian. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN's  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , says that if land is used more effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans. It was finalised following discussions held here in Geneva, Switzerland. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA \"We're not telling people to stop eating meat. In some places people have no other choice. But it's obvious that in the West we're eating far too much,\" said Prof Pete Smith, an environmental scientist from Aberdeen University, UK. We're also wasting too much food. The panel estimates that greenhouse emissions associated with food loss and waste - from field to kitchen bin - is as high as 8-10% of ALL global emissions. The report calls for vigorous action to halt soil damage and desertification - both of which contribute to climate change. It also warns that plans by some governments to grow trees and burn them to generate electricity will compete with food production unless carried out on a limited scale. The Earth's land surface, and the way it is used, forms the basis for human society and the global economy.  But we are re-shaping it in dramatic ways, including through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. How the land responds to human-induced climate change is a vital concern for the future. This video can not be played Climate change poses a threat to the security of our food supply. Rising temperatures, increased rain and more extreme weather events will all have an impact on crops and livestock. But food production also contributes to global warming. Agriculture - together with forestry - accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures, for example. The environmental impact of meat production is important to many vegetarians and vegans. A UK-based group called #NoBeef lobbies caterers to take beef and lamb off student menus. In the US, vegan burger patties are made from plant-based meat substitutes said to taste like the real thing thanks to an iron-rich compound called heme. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, said: \"A reduction in meat consumption is essential if we are to meet climate targets.\" But in some parts of the world, such as China, beef consumption is growing. This is despite attempts by the Chinese central government to promote traditional diets. The authors of the report encourage action to stop wasting food - either before or after its sale to consumers. Waste food can sometimes be used as animal feed or, if suitable, redirected to charities to feed people in need. One organisation here in Switzerland called Partage takes in unsold food discarded by shops and distributes it to local families. It also collects stale bread and turns it into biscuits, dries fruit, and cans vegetables. All of this helps reduce the CO2 emissions involved in producing food. July was 'marginally' world's warmest month ever  Hungry nations add the least to global CO2 Stop abusing land, scientists warn Road-testing the diet to save the world The extra carbon that humans have put into the atmosphere is nourishing the growth of forests - especially in the Northern Hemisphere.  This can help to mitigate climate change, but it all comes down to a balance of factors. Experts say this effect on forests will be negated if the Earth heats up too much. In fact, the report says areas near the equator may already be losing vegetation through heat stress. Dr Katrin Fleischer, from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, warned that in some places a shortage of phosphorus in soil - a key ingredient for plant growth - would also hinder tree growth.  She said: \"This would mean that the rainforest has already reached its limit and would be unable to absorb any more carbon dioxide emissions. \"If this scenario turns out to be true, the Earth's climate would heat up significantly faster.\" Soil is sometimes neglected as part of the climate system. But it's the second largest store of carbon after the oceans.  Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and lock the carbon away in the soil. But deforestation and poor farming practices can damage its ability to do this. When soil is degraded, carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, while further plant growth is compromised. Climate change is expected to speed this process up. Higher temperatures can help break down the organic matter in soil, boosting greenhouse emissions. The report says reducing and reversing soil damage provides immediate benefits to local communities. Better land management, including controlled grazing by animals and tree planting, can boost soil fertility, helping to reduce poverty and boost food security. \"It's really clear that the land's being degraded through over-exploitation - and that's making climate change worse,\" said Prof Smith. \"The land is part of the problem but if we wise up about the way we use it, it can part of the climate solution.\" Changing the way humans use the land surface is a daunting challenge, especially as it will entail a major shift in farming methods. Nevertheless, scientists say people need to: But one practice touted as a climate change solution - bioenergy - has been treated with caution by IPCC experts. Bioenergy involves burning vegetation as a substitute for fossil fuels.  To some countries, it appears to be an attractive option because CO2 emissions from the process can be captured.

Select from 1,000 major cities around the world The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts bioenergy will outpace solar, wind and hydropower in the next five years. But the authors of the IPCC report say converting land to bioenergy could deprive countries of soil to grow much-needed crops. They advise limits on the amount of land used for biofuels.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Is this the simplest way to show what is meant by global warming? The chart below organises all the countries of the world by region, time and temperature. The trend is unmistakeable. Each line of coloured pixels is the temperature record of an individual nation within its region, stacked one atop the other. Blues are cooler years; the reds are warmer. The far left is 1900; the far right is the present day.  The entire planet has got hotter, increasingly so in recent decades. This global \"Climate Stripes\" graphic is the work of Prof Ed Hawkins at Reading University who has sought clearer ways to communicate the issues around climate change - and to start conversations that might lead to solutions.  He got the idea one January - the month the big meteorological agencies release their annual assessments of the state of the climate. Prof Hawkins experimented with different ways of rendering the agencies' global data and chanced upon the coloured stripes idea. When he tried out a banner on festival-goers at Hay, he knew he'd struck a chord.  The Reading climate scientist now has a website,  #ShowYourStripes , that allows anyone to download the stripes for their country and a few select cities (most stripes are built on global data collated by  Berkeley Earth ). People have been turning these patterns into wearable garments - ties, dresses, jumpers, and leggings. Someone in Minnesota in the US has even painted their Tesla electric car in the stripes.  \"What I've learnt from this is that you don't need the numbers to get the message across. The colours will do that,\" Prof Hawkins told BBC News. \"It's all about finding different ways to communicate to people, to tap into different groups, because not everyone has got it. Maybe some of them switch off whenever science is mentioned. This is another way of getting through to them.\" How could you  #ShowYourStripes  using the graphics from  https:\/\/t.co\/Zd3HFHcXQe ? 1) Paint your  @Tesla  like  @NetZeroMN  did  pic.twitter.com\/XI9lCF1I1j For those with a scientific bent, the graphic at the top of this page will, though, highlight some interesting features that might otherwise be missed in a different rendering of global data. Notice how the regions do not warm in unison. They appear as discrete blocks, Europe being the most obvious stand-out example. That's understandable. Each continent is an individual actor in the climate, influencing - and being influenced by - the system as a whole. Look at the beginning of the 1940s in particular. See how in Europe there is a strong band of blue compared with the rest of the world. This is quite a well-studied period that was  probably linked to a large El Ni\u00f1o event  - the climate cycle associated with shifting pressure patterns and a weakening of the trade winds in the Pacific.   The world warmed, apart from Europe which had a deep cold spell. And it probably had an impact on the outcome of WWII. The harsh winters at the time frustrated Hitler's armies as they invaded the Soviet Union.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Future increases in rainfall in England could significantly impact emergency responses, according to a new study. Researchers say  that flood conditions could see just 9% of some rural populations reached by an ambulance within the 7-15 minute mandatory timeframe. Older people living in rural areas would be worst affected, the authors say. They say there should be a rethink on ambulance locations in flooding events. Flooding is one of the most devastating impacts of climate change. According to studies, it is likely to increase in the future.  The Met Office has  indicated  that an extended period of extreme rainfall in winter, similar to what was seen in parts of England between 2013 and 2014 is now about seven times more likely because of human-induced climate change.  To find out how this changing rainfall might impact on ambulance and fire and rescue services, researchers projected the impacts of floods that might occur once in 30 years, once in 100 years and once in 1,000 years. In England, emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of the weather conditions.  In normal conditions, around 84% of England's population can be reached by ambulance in around seven minutes.  The researchers found that when a once in 30-year flood event struck, this dropped to 67%.  With a once in a 100-year flood, just over half the population would be reachable in seven minutes, while in a once in a 1,000-year flood, only 27% of the total population would see an ambulance inside that time limit. Different locations had different outcomes according to the study. East Riding and Berkshire would see their coverage reduce to 9% and 12% respectively.  \"Even the small magnitude floods affect the emergency response,\" said lead author Prof Dapeng Yu from Loughborough University. \"Ambulance services have been centralised in recent decades, so in villages or small towns there's no ambulance service, therefore when an incident happens in rural areas, it takes a lot longer for them to reach.\" As well as rural areas, large urban centres including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Newcastle, would also see a reduction in response time under a 30-year flood. Care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools would be among the most vulnerable locations with older people in rural areas likely worst-hit, according to the study.  The authors say that the day of the Brexit referendum on 23 June in 2016 is a good example of what can happen to the emergency services during surface flooding events.  Referendum day was memorable for  large-scale surface flooding in many parts of London  after torrential rain. Around 450 flooding incidents were attended by the London Fire and Rescue Service, which was three times the number from the previous day. The London fire service target timeframe for reaching incidents is six minutes and on June 23, 59% of journeys were outside that target.  \"You don't know when it's going to hit and you don't know how hard it is going to hit,\" said Prof Dapeng Yu. \"But when it happens, like in London during the referendum day, it is really striking.\" \"It really shows the impacts, you will receive three times more calls than normal and your ability to reach them in six minutes is massively compromised.\" The authors say that their study shows that the emergency services are particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in rainfall.  The impacts would be greater with surface flooding events rather than with river or coastal flooding. Preventing unnecessary delays in the future will require planners to identify hotspots of vulnerability and to re-think the distribution of ambulances and fire stations.  \"With climate change, flooding will likely become more frequent and more intense,\"said Prof Dapeng Yu. \"So certainly, when the authorities consider the strategic plan for new ambulance stations or fire stations, they need to consider this factor.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Sustainability.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Millions of highly polluting used cars from rich countries are being \"dumped\" on developing nations, according to a UN report. Between 2015 and 2018, some 14 million older, poor quality vehicles were exported from Europe, Japan and the US. Four out of five were sold to poorer countries, with more than half going to Africa.  Experts say that up to 80% failed to meet minimum safety and environmental standards in exporting countries. As well as causing accidents, these cars make air pollution worse and contribute heavily to climate change. Many of the vehicles have also been tampered with to remove valuable parts.  The report,  published by the UN Environment Programme (Unep) , says that both exporters and importers need to put tougher regulations in place to stem the flow of these cars.  Car ownership is booming all over the world with an estimated 1.4bn vehicles on the roads, a number that's expected to reach around two billion by 2040.  Much of that growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.  In their three-year analysis, researchers found that regulations on car imports in the majority of the 146 countries they studied were \"weak\" or \"very weak\". A  second study on the issue, by the Netherlands Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate , shows that many cars and vans shipped from Dutch ports to Africa are outdated and contribute to worsening air quality on the continent.  \"What we can say is that of those 14 million vehicles up to around 80% are not roadworthy and don't meet a vehicle emission standard that is called Euro 4,\" said Rob de Jong, from Unep, one of the report's authors.  The  Euro 4  car standard came into force in Europe in January 2005. \"That means that those vehicles emit 90% more emissions because they are not meeting this minimal standard,\" said Mr de Jong. According to the authors, these cars are both \"dangerous and dirty.\"  They believe these imports are responsible for increased levels of road accidents in many poorer African and Asian countries. The cars are also pumping out fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which are major sources of air pollution in many cities. \"In 2017, the average age of a diesel vehicle imported into Uganda was over 20 years old,\" said Jane Akumu, also from Unep. \"This is the same story for Zimbabwe. In fact, around 30 countries of Africa do not have any age limit on cars. So, any kind of car of any kind of age, can come in.\" As well as failing to meet road safety and environmental standards, a significant number were tampered with and had important equipment removed.  \"They cut out catalytic converters, because the platinum value is worth $500. And they put in a piece of steel pipe and weld it back in,\" said Rob de Jong.  \"They have illegally removed the airbags, because they have a value in Europe, they have illegally removed the anti-lock brake system because it has a value and is being sold on the black market.\" Of the vehicles in the report, more than 54% came from Europe. Many were exported through the Netherlands.  The Dutch authorities are concerned about the trade and want action taken at the European level. \"The Netherlands cannot address this issue alone,\" said Stientje van Veldhoven, the Netherlands minister for the environment.  \"Therefore, I will call for a coordinated European approach, and a close cooperation between European and African governments, to ensure that the EU only exports vehicles that are fit for purpose, and compliant with standards set by importing countries.\" The growing realisation of the dangers posed by these cars has seen several importing countries stiffen their regulations.  Morocco only permits cars less than five years old to be imported. Kenya also has an age limit of eight years for imported cars. On a regional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), representing 15 countries, has set cleaner fuel and vehicle standards from January 2021.  But to really deal with the issue will require action at both ends of the supply chain. \"On one hand, I think it's unethical that these developed countries export vehicles that are not roadworthy on their own roads,\" said Rob de Jong. \"On the other hand, why have the importing countries been waiting so long to put in place some minimum standards? \"So I think the onus is not only on the exporting country, it's really a joint responsibility.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The Duke of Sussex says there is \"a race against time\" to halt global warming, adding that he is \"troubled\" by climate change deniers. \"I don't believe that there's anybody in this world that can deny science,\" he said.  He called it \"an emergency\", adding \"the world's children are striking\" after teenage activist Greta Thunberg led a worldwide protest on Friday. Prince Harry is visiting Botswana as part of a tour of southern Africa.  He says it was the place he went to \"to get away from it all\" after his mother's death. The duke had visited the country soon after Diana, Princess of Wales, died in August 1997 and had made \"some of my closest friends\" there. \"Now I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa,\" he said during a visit to the Chobe Tree Reserve. The prince helped plant trees at the site, which has been affected by decades of deforestation. \"This last week, led by Greta, the world's children are striking,\" the prince said. \"It's a race against time and one in which we are losing. Everyone knows it.  \"There's no excuse for not knowing that and the most troubling part of that is that I don't believe that there's anybody in this world that can deny science.\" He went on to say there had been scientific evidence of climate change for at least 30 years. \"And it's only getting stronger and stronger,\" he added. He worked with a group to push a 10-metre tree tree upright and packed it with soil. When he saw the large mound of earth that needed to be shovelled, he smiled and asked: \"How long do we have?\" Africa is close to Harry's heart. It is the continent where he appears most at ease. He's been coming here since he was a teenager. It helped him to find solace after his mother's death and it was to Africa, specifically to Botswana, that he brought Meghan Markle shortly after their romance began. Little surprise then that it is to southern Africa that they have come for their first official overseas trip as a family - Harry, Meghan and four-month-old Archie. There has been ground to make up after what was regarded as recent ill-judged steps - involving celebrity friends, private jet flights and costly house renovations.  For several months the headlines have tended to be negative. But this visit has marked a return to a more grounded approach with Meghan's fluent sincerity as she addressed the issue of violence against women in Cape Town's most violent township. She identified with them as a \"woman of colour and as their sister.\" Harry too has struck the right note in his comments about mental health and the need to mobilise more effectively against climate change. Even young Archie did his bit with a happily headline-stealing appearance when the family went to visit Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As Harry struck out on his own to Botswana, Angola and Malawi he is entitled to feel that everything, so far, has gone according to plan. Prince Harry is on an official tour with the Duchess of Sussex and their baby son Archie,  who was introduced to the renowned anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu  in South Africa on Wednesday. The royal couple also met faith leaders at South Africa's oldest mosque and visited a charity that provides mental health support to young people. The duchess told girls in a deprived part of the country she was visiting South Africa not only as a member of the Royal Family, but also  \"as a woman of colour and as your sister\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst This video can not be played A new tunnel linking Kent and Essex will create five million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), figures suggest. Estimates say building the Lower Thames Crossing (LTC), a flagship project in the UK's roads programme, will emit 2 million tonnes of the greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, traffic created by the road is expected to generate another 3.2 million tonnes over 60 years. Environmentalists say the statistics make a mockery of the prime minister\u2019s claim to lead on climate change. A government report published in March provisionally estimated the UK's net carbon emissions in 2019 to be 351.5 million tonnes. The Thames crossing  is said to be the UK's biggest roads project since the M25. Ministers say the scheme, supported by the CBI and the AA, will bring a huge economic boost on both sides of the river and relieve congestion on the orbital motorway. But the emissions figures, obtained through a  Freedom of Information request  after Highways England initially declined to release them, have angered environmentalists. Campaigners say the tunnel should never have been proposed without a debate on the projected CO2 impacts, and have demanded the government freeze all projects that will increase emissions. Environmentalists have been campaigning for the Highways Agency to publish a CO2 analysis of its full road-building programme. Other schemes will also generate CO2, such as the planned Stonehenge tunnel, which is expected to create half a million tonnes during construction.  Chris Todd, from green group Transport Action Network, told BBC News: \u201cIf the government is serious about tackling climate change, it can't keep ignoring the emissions roads are causing\".  Boris Johnson, who will host a global climate conference on Saturday, has pledged to cut the UK\u2019s emissions by 68% against 1990 levels) by the end of this decade. He\u2019s encouraging other nations to follow suit with ambitious offers as the climate warms. Mr Todd said: \u201cWe welcome greater ambition from the PM on the international stage, but it\u2019s very easy to make announcements without taking action \u2013 and right now transport policy is making a mockery of his promises.\u201d The eventual CO2 outputs for the roads should be lower than projected because of the advent of electric cars. But campaigners point out that making and running EVs still takes a great deal of energy and resources.  This row is part of a bigger critique of the UK\u2019s whole infrastructure programme.  The Prime Minister is an enthusiastic supporter of eye-catching concrete-heavy projects. But these typically carry a high carbon cost. Meanwhile other less telegenic forms of infrastructure create more jobs than mega-projects, and quickly start to save CO2 emissions overall.  Refurbishing homes, for instance, is estimated to create four times more jobs than road building.  Improving broadband can take cars off the road,  according to the AA , by improving employees' ability to work from home.  This also meets the wish of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who  says more people need to switch away from their cars .  In his recent statement, the Chancellor promised \u00a327bn to roads, \u00a3100bn to HS2 and just \u00a31bn next year for his Green Homes Grant to insulate dwellings. A Highways England spokesperson told BBC News: \"The Lower Thames Crossing is the UK\u2019s most ambitious roads project in a generation, which will add billions to the national, regional and local economies by almost doubling road capacity between Kent and Essex and reducing delays. \u201cBut it will also impact on the environment and minimising this impact is a key priority for us. Our proposed design includes the UK\u2019s longest road tunnel as it offers the best possible local environmental benefits,  \u201cHowever, tunnels by their nature require large volumes of concrete with a high carbon footprint.\u201d Highways England told BBC News it has changed construction methods to reduce emissions.

{"id":null,"body":"By Kirstie Brewer BBC News Coronavirus has plunged the world into uncertainty and the constant news about the pandemic can feel relentless. All of this is taking its toll on people's mental health, particularly those already living with conditions like anxiety and OCD. So how can we protect our mental health?  Being concerned about the news is understandable, but for many people it can make existing mental health problems worse.  When the World Health Organization released advice on  protecting your mental health during the coronavirus outbreak , it was broadly welcomed.  As Anxiety UK's Nicky Lidbetter explains, the fear of being out of control and unable to tolerate uncertainty are common characteristics of many anxiety disorders. So it's understandable that many individuals with pre-existing anxiety are facing challenges at the moment.  \"A lot of anxiety is rooted in worrying about the unknown and waiting for something to happen - coronavirus is that on a macro scale,\" agrees Rosie Weatherley, spokesperson for mental health charity Mind.   So how can we protect our mental health?  Reading lots of news about coronavirus has led to panic attacks for Nick, a father-of-two from Kent, who lives with anxiety.  \"When I'm feeling anxious my thoughts can spiral out of control and I start thinking about catastrophic outcomes,\" he says. Nick is worried about his parents and other older people he knows.   \"Usually when I suffer I can walk away from a situation. This is out of my control,\" he says.  Having long periods away from news websites and social media has helped him to manage his anxiety. He has also found support helplines, run by mental health charities such as AnxietyUK, useful.  This video can not be played Alison, 24, from Manchester, has health anxiety and feels compelled to stay informed and research the subject. But at the same time she knows social media can be a trigger.  \"A month ago I was clicking on hashtags and seeing all this unverified conspiracy rubbish and it would make me really anxious and I would feel really hopeless and cry,\" she says.   Now she is careful about which accounts she tunes into and is avoiding clicking on coronavirus hashtags. She is also trying hard to have time away from social media, watching TV or reading books instead.   OCD Action has seen an increase in support requests from people whose fears have become focused on the coronavirus pandemic.  For people with OCD and some types of anxiety, being constantly told to wash your hands can be especially difficult to hear.  This is a tough time for us OCDers. For those who have been through contamination  #OCD , the response to  #COVID19  feels like watching our brains being flipped inside out. It's weird seeing people act in ways (repeated sanitizer, fear of touching stuff) we associate with being ill. For Lily Bailey, author of Because We Are Bad, a book about living with OCD, fear of contamination was one aspect of her obsessive compulsive disorder. She says the advice about hand washing can be a huge trigger for people who have recovered.  \"It's really difficult because I now have to do some of the behaviours that I've been avoiding,\" says Bailey. \"I'm sticking to the advice really rigidly but it's hard, considering that for me, soap and sanitiser used to be something comparable to an addiction.\"  Charity OCD Action says the issue to look out for is the function - for example, is the washing being carried out for the recommended amount of time to reduce the risk of spreading of the virus - or is it being done ritualistically in a specific order to feel \"just right\"? Bailey points out that for a lot of people with OCD, getting better means being able to leave the house - so self-isolating can present another challenge.  \"If we're forced to stay at home, we have lots of time on our hands, and boredom can make OCD worse,\" she says.  Staying in touch with those you care about will help to maintain good mental health during long periods of self-isolation. \"Agree regular check-in times and feel connected to the people around you,\" says Weatherley. Strike a balance between having a routine and making sure each day has some variety. For some people it might end up actually feeling like quite a productive or restful period. You could work through your to-do list or read a book you'd been meaning to get to. With weeks and months of the coronavirus pandemic ahead, it is important to have down time. Mind recommends continuing to access nature and sunlight wherever possible. Do exercise, eat well and stay hydrated.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Last week's record breaking heatwave across much of Europe was made \"at least five times\" more likely to happen by climate change, say scientists. Their rapid attribution study says that rising temperatures \"super-charged\" the event, making it more likely to happen than through natural variability alone.  Heatwaves in June are now about 4C hotter than they used to be, the researchers said.  Globally, the average temperature for June was the highest on record. Heatwaves naturally occur in summertime but last week's event in many European countries was unprecedented because it happened so early, and the recorded temperatures were so high.  Records were broken at locations in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Spain. The new French record, established at Gallargues-le-Montueux last Friday, was more than 1.5C above the previous high mark.   Much of the concern about the heat focused on France, with red alerts in several areas, many schools were closed, exams were postponed and health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn warned that \"everyone is at risk\". The immediate cause of the heatwave was the weather, with hot air drawn in from northern Africa, caused by high pressure over central Europe and a storm stalling over the Atlantic. This video can not be played By lucky coincidence, the authors of this new study happened to be in Toulouse, France, at a conference on climate change and extreme events.  The researchers, members of the World Weather Attribution Group decided to use the opportunity to analyse the link between human-induced climate change and the heatwave.  They defined the heatwave as the highest three-day averaged daily mean temperature in June, arguing that this is a better indicator of health impacts than maximums or minimums.  The researchers compared the observations of temperatures recorded during the month of June with climate models that can show how the world would be without the human influence on the climate.  They found that, over France, the probability of having a heatwave had increased by at least a factor of five. However, the researchers say that this influence could be much higher still, by a factor of 100 or more.  \"We are very confident that this lower boundary of factor five is valid  - but we are not confident we can say much more than that,\" said Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. \"The reason we are fairly careful is because we found fairly large discrepancies between the modelled properties of heatwaves and the observed properties of heatwaves. They all show stronger heatwaves but the trend in the observations is much larger than in the trends in the model.\" The scientists say that the observations indicate a heatwave trend of around 4C in June, where the models show a much lower trend. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, June generally was more than 2 degrees above the long term average. Globally the temperature was also the highest for June on record, being about 0.1C higher than 2016. Heatwaves in the 1970s and 1980s in Europe were limited somewhat because of what's termed aerosol cooling. This is essentially the impact of air pollution which for a number of years exerted a cooling influence. However, as the air has become clearer, heatwaves have come back with a vengeance.  According to those involved with this study, this trend in heatwaves is likely to get worse.  \"We experienced a heatwave whose intensity could become the norm in the middle of the century,\" said Dr Robert Vautard, Senior Scientist, CNRS, France. \"The new record of 45.9C set in France last Friday is one more step to confirmation that, without urgent climate mitigation actions, temperatures in France could potentially rise to about 50\u00b0C or more in France by the end of the century.\" The researchers believe that if global warming continues to the 2C level envisioned in the Paris climate agreement, heatwaves like the one experienced last week will become the norm in June.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Madrid Scientists say that average temperatures from 2010-2019 look set to make it the warmest decade on record. Provisional figures released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggest this year is on course to be the second or third warmest year ever. If those numbers hold, 2015-2019 would end up being the warmest five-year period in the record. This \"exceptional\" global heat is driven by greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO says. The organisation's State of the Global Climate report for 2019 covers the year up to October, when the global mean temperature for the period was 1.1 degrees C above the \"baseline\" level in 1850. Many parts of the world experienced unusual levels of warmth this year. South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania were warmer than the recent average, while many parts of North America were colder than usual.  Two major heat waves hit Europe in June and July this year, with a new national record of 46C set in France on 28 June.  New national records were also set in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the UK. In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree.  Wildfire activity in South America this year was the highest since 2010. The WMO clearly links the record temperatures seen over the past decade to ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases, from human activities such as driving cars, cutting down forests and burning coal for energy.  In 2018, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide all reached new record highs.  The WMO says the warming experienced over the past decade is taking its toll on the natural world. The ice is melting at both poles and sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993.  Much of the heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions is going into the oceans, says the WMO. The waters are more acidic as a result and marine heat waves are becoming more common. As well as hurting nature, the increased heat is also affecting humans, with heat waves posing a particular risk to the elderly.  \"On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and 'abnormal' weather. And, once again in 2019, weather and climate-related risks hit hard,\" said the WMO's secretary-general Petteri Taalas. \"Heat waves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,\" Mr Taalas continued. Since the 1980s, every successive decade has been warmer than the one that preceded it.  Other scientists reacted to the release of the report with concern. \"It's shocking how much climate change in 2019 has already led to lives lost, poor health, food insecurity and displaced populations,\" said Dr Joanna House, from the University of Bristol. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA \"Even as a climate scientist who knows the evidence and the projections, I find this deeply upsetting.  What is more shocking is how long very little has been done about this. We have the information, the solutions, what we need now is urgent action.\" The report has been released at global climate talks taking place in Madrid. Negotiators here have started two weeks of talks aimed at improving the world's pledges to cut carbon.  Some of those attending the meeting say the WMO report would help concentrate minds on dealing with the root causes of climate change. \"Now we know that global temperatures are rising to record levels and without action we can expect more climate suffering. It's vital we phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible,\" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.  \"The good news is this is a timely wake-up call at the start of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. Delegates have no excuse to block progress or drag their feet when the science is showing how urgently action is needed.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018. The  World Meteorological Organization  (WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade.  Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts.   Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases.  The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions.  The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation.  Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees.  This video can not be played Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously.   This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the \"pre-industrial\" level in 1750.  The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps.  Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years.  Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750.  Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade. What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping. \"There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.    \"We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,\" he added. \"It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,\" said Mr Taalas. The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact.  Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018. Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tom Edgington BBC Reality Check The supermarket chain Morrisons is raising the price of its reusable plastic bags from 10p to 15p as a trial and introducing a 20p paper version. The paper bags will be available in eight stores as part of a two-month trial. The supermarket chain said reducing plastic was their customers' top environmental concern.  Paper bags remain popular in the US, but they fell out of use in UK supermarkets in the 1970s as plastic was seen as a more durable material. But are paper bags more environmentally friendly than plastic ones? The answer comes down to: In 2011  a research paper produced by the Northern Ireland Assembly  said it \"takes more than four times as much energy to manufacture a paper bag as it does to manufacture a plastic bag.\" Unlike plastic bags (which the report says are produced from the waste products of oil refining) paper requires forests to be cut down to produce the bags. The manufacturing process, according to the research, also produces a higher concentration of toxic chemicals compared with making single-use plastic bags. Paper bags also weigh more than plastic; this means transportation requires more energy, adding to their carbon footprint, the study adds. Morrisons says that the material used to make its paper bags will be 100% sourced from forests that are managed responsibly. And if new forests are grown to replace lost trees, this will help to offset the climate change impact, because trees lock up carbon from the atmosphere. In 2006, the Environment Agency examined a range of bags made from different materials to find out how many times they need to be reused in order to have a lower global warming potential than a conventional single-use plastic bag. The study  found paper bags needed to be reused at least three times, one fewer than plastic bags for life (four times) . At the other end of the spectrum, the Environment Agency found that cotton bags required the most number of reuses, at 131. That was down to the high amount of energy used to produce and fertilise cotton yarn. But even if a paper bag requires the fewest reuses there is a practical consideration: will it last long enough to survive at least three trips to the supermarket? Paper bags are not as durable as bags for life, being more likely to split or tear, especially if they get wet. In its conclusion, the Environment Agency says \"it is unlikely the paper bag can be regularly reused the required number of times due to its low durability\".  Morrisons insists there is no reason its paper bag cannot be reused as many times as the plastic one it is replacing, although it depends on how the bag is treated. Cotton bags, despite being the most carbon intensive to manufacture, are the most durable and will have a much longer life.  Despite its low durability, one advantage of paper is that it decomposes much more quickly than plastic, and therefore it is less likely to be a source of litter and pose a risk to wildlife.  Paper is also more widely recyclable, while plastic bags can take between 400 and 1,000 years to decompose.  Paper bags require marginally fewer reuses than bags for life to make them more environmentally friendly than single-use plastic bags. On the other hand, paper bags are less durable than other types of bags. So if customers have to replace their paper ones more frequently, it will have a greater environmental effect. But the key to reducing the impact of all carrier bags - no matter what they are made of -  is to reuse them as much as possible, says Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at Northampton University. Many people forget to bring their reusable bags on their weekly supermarket trip, and end up having to buy more bags at the till, she says. This will have a much bigger environmental impact compared with just choosing to use paper, plastic or cotton.  What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

{"id":null,"body":"A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned of disastrous consequences if current trends of global warming are not reversed immediately. Aayushi Awasthy from the University of East Anglia's Energy and Resources Institute explains why this has particular consequences for India and South Asia. The IPCC report, which was released earlier this month, has been called the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. The report says that the impact of a 1.5C increase in global temperatures will \"disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations through food insecurity, higher food prices, income losses, lost livelihood opportunities, adverse health impacts, and population displacements\". India stands to be one of the nations most significantly affected, given its huge population and levels of inequality and poverty. If exposed to the kind of destabilisation the report talks about, the impact on India could be devastating - not just socially but also politically.  For one, sea level rise will have a disastrous impact on the country, given its large coastline, and the number of people who live close to and depend on the sea for their livelihoods.  On the other hand, deadly heatwaves - similar to one in 2015 that killed thousands of people in India and Pakistan - could soon become the norm, with the eastern Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) and the southern Pakistani city of Karachi likely to be the worst affected.  And while the report says that it is not too late to reverse rising temperatures and minimise some of the harm, it will not be easy to do for countries in South Asia, which are largely developing economies with limited resources.  The report estimates that investment to limit global warming between 2015 and 2050 could cost nations around $900bn (\u00a3694bn).  But this seems to be an underestimate.  When publicly outlining what post-2020 climate actions they intended to take under a new international agreement, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), many countries gave much higher cost estimates. India said merely achieving its INDC targets would cost it $1tn, while Pakistan has estimated a cost of $40bn. These figures give a sense of the magnitude of the problem.   It is unclear who will bear these enormous costs. The Green Climate Fund has been woefully missing its deadlines for gathering funds.  In its endorsement of the latest IPCC report, India has said it will bear a disproportionate burden of climate change.  This claim is not entirely untrue. India is under pressure to mitigate climate change by controlling emission growth. But it will also need to adapt to increased water scarcity, droughts, floods, cyclones and other natural disasters.  The country has developed a fairly good disaster management system but it needs more resources to develop further. It has also set ambitious targets on renewable energy.   The critical question, of course, is about next steps.  The world's nations are due to meet again in Katowice, Poland to discuss the results of the report in about two months. There are a few important messages from the report that are of critical discussion especially from the point of view of South Asian countries.  The first is how the world is expected to achieve its targets.  One method outlined in the report is \"overshoot\", which means that countries can briefly exceed the 1.5C target and then use cutting edge technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere so that we can eventually get back on track.  But this is a strange discussion to have, because as the report mentions with very high confidence, the technologies for large scale removal are not available at the scale required. Furthermore, this sets perverse incentives and gives countries a sense of complacency, when there is none.  The second important message is that in the absence of overshoot allowances, the world needs to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.   This is important for India since it has not yet set out a target for when it will start reducing total emissions (the so-called peak emission year).  China has already named 2030 as its peak emission year.  India is currently developing a mid-century strategy for low carbon growth and the results of that study may allude to a peak year.  It has also set fairly ambitious renewable energy targets, but these come with their own set of challenges. For instance, it would need to store renewable energy on a massive scale, but the price of battery storage has not been falling fast enough to make this a viable option. The second challenge is India's growing demand for transport. Currently the country has a very high number of bicycles and cycle rickshaws.  But as incomes increase, more and more people are starting to migrate towards vehicles like motorcycles and scooters.  To mitigate that, India needs to introduce electric vehicles and also urgently strengthen its bus, rail and public infrastructure to move towards more sustainable means of transport.  This will be a challenge because the resources that will be required in terms of technology and finance are not clear.  But what is clear, is that to dramatically reduce emissions by 2050, the solutions for these problems need to be thought about today.  And given that South Asian countries clearly lack the capacity to solve these issues on their own, international co-operation will become all the more crucial to ensure that the world does not miss its targets again.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played Scientists believe that global sea levels could rise far more than predicted, due to accelerating melting in Greenland and Antarctica. The long-held view has been that the world's seas would rise by a maximum of just under a metre by 2100. This  new study , based on expert opinions, projects that the real level may be around double that figure.  This could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, the authors say.  The  question of sea-level rise  was one of the most controversial issues raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), when it published its fifth assessment report in 2013.  It said the continued warming of the planet, without major reductions in emissions, would see global waters rising by between 52cm and 98cm by 2100. This video can not be played Many experts believe this was a very conservative estimate. Ice scientists are also concerned that the models currently used to predict the influence of huge ice sheets on sea levels don't capture all of the uncertainties about how these are now melting.  To try to get a clearer picture, some of the leading researchers in the field carried out what is termed a structured expert judgement study, where the scientists make predictions based on their knowledge and understanding of what is happening in Greenland, West and East Antarctica. In the researchers' view, if emissions continue on the current trajectory then the world's seas would be very likely to rise by between 62cm and 238cm by 2100. This would be in a world that had warmed by around 5C - one of the worst-case scenarios for global warming. \"For 2100, the ice sheet contribution is very likely in the range of 7-178cm but once you add in glaciers and ice caps outside the ice sheets and thermal expansion of the seas, you tip well over two metres,\" said lead author Prof Jonathan Bamber from the University of Bristol.  The IPCC report in 2013 only considered what is \"likely\" to happen, which in scientific terms means they looked at 17-83% of the range of possibilities.  This new study looks at a broader range of results, covering 5-95% of the estimates.   For expected temperature rises up to 2C, Greenland's ice sheet remains the single biggest contributor to sea-level rise. However, as temperatures go beyond this, the much larger Antarctic ice sheets start to come into play.  \"When you start to look at these lower likelihood but still plausible values, then the experts believe that there is a small but statistically significant probability that West Antarctica will transition to a very unstable state and parts of East Antarctica will start contributing as well,\" said Prof Bamber.   \"But it's only at these higher probabilities for 5C that we see those type of behaviours kicking in.\" According to the authors, this scenario would have huge implications for the planet.  They calculate that the world would lose an area of land equal to 1.79 million square kilometres - equivalent to the size of Libya.  Much of the land losses would be in important food growing areas such as the delta of the Nile.  Large swathes of Bangladesh would be very difficult for people to continue to live in. Major global cities, including London, New York and Shanghai would be under threat.  \"To put this into perspective, the Syrian refugee crisis resulted in about a million refugees coming into Europe,\" said Prof Bamber.  \"That is about 200 times smaller than the number of people who would be displaced in a 2m sea-level rise.\"  The authors emphasise that there is still time to avoid these type of scenarios, if major cuts in emissions take place over the coming decades. They acknowledge that the chances of hitting the high end of this range are small, around 5%, but they should not be discounted, according to the lead author.  \"If I said to you that there was a one in 20 chance that if you crossed the road you would be squashed you wouldn't go near it,\" said Prof Bamber.  \"Even a 1% probability means that a one in a hundred year flood is something that could happen in your lifetime.  I think that a 5% probability, crikey - I think that's a serious risk.\" Other experts in the field said that the findings of the expert group were significant.  \"This kind of survey of experts is important, because computer models are not perfect at predicting the future,\" said Dr Tamsin Edwards from King's College London.  \"Here they took the eight most accurate of 22 experts on Antarctica and Greenland and combined their judgements about the future. The ice sheets are losing ice at increasing rates, and we can't rule out high values of sea level rise, though it's also important to note they're unlikely - especially as we are starting to put policies in place to avoid such a high level of warming.\"  The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News The former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has added his voice to calls for industrialised nations to invest in a greener economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.\u00a0 He shared his comments in an online discussion about climate change with the former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull.  Both called on nations to accelerate a transition to cleaner energy. The event was organised by the Policy Exchange think tank.  Mr Carney said that the pandemic was \"a\u00a0terrible situation, but there was also a big opportunity\" at the end of it. \"We have a situation with climate change which will involve every country in the world and from which we can't self-isolate,\" he added. As has rapidly become the socially distant norm, both participants joined the discussion via video conference from their respective homes - setting out how they saw ways in which countries could emerge from the crisis with cleaner, more sustainable economies.  Mr Turnbull, who was Australia's prime minister from 2015-2018, issued blunt, broad criticisms of many governments for failing to take the science of climate change seriously.  Drawing bleak parallels with the pandemic, Mr Turnbull said Covid-19 was a case of \"biology confronting and shaking the complacency of day-to-day politics with a physical reality of sickness and death\".   \"The question is, when will the physics of climate change mug the complacency and denialism - just as biology has with respect to the virus.\"  Mr Carney, who stepped down as Bank of England governor in March, just before the UK lockdown began, explained that, at a time when many industries would have to restructure, this would be a chance \"to try not go back to the status quo\".  As countries re-launched and rebuilt their economies, they \"should try to leapfrog ahead\", he said.  He recommended regulatory policies that would push economies more quickly towards greener growth - and a more sustainable future - citing the UK's plan to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Governments, he added, should also take the opportunity to invest in wind and solar power to accelerate the transition to greener energy. Many countries would have the opportunity to invest in sustainable infrastructure, Mr Carney said, pointing out that that opportunity was missed after the 2008 financial crisis.  \"You can't wish away the systemic risk,\" he said. \"In the end, a small investment up front can save a tremendous cost down the road.\"  This video can not be played Climate change: 'Invest $1.8 trillion to adapt' Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK cannot go climate neutral much before 2050 unless people stop flying and eating red meat almost completely, a report says. But it warns that the British public do not look ready to take such steps and substantially change their lifestyle. The report challenges the views of campaign group Extinction Rebellion. It believes the UK target of climate neutrality by 2050 will result in harm to the climate. The claim comes from the government-funded research group Energy Systems Catapult, whose computer models are used by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises government. Its report says: \"A number of groups have called for net zero to be accelerated to 2025, 2030 or 2040.  \"Achieving net zero significantly earlier than 2050 in our modelling exceeds even our most speculative measures, with rates of change for power, heat and road transport that push against the bounds of plausibility.\" But the authors offer some optimism too. They calculate that the UK  can  cut emissions fast enough to be climate neutral by 2050 \u2013 but only if ministers act much more quickly. They say the government urgently needs to invest in three key technologies: carbon capture and storage with bioenergy crops; hydrogen for a wide variety of uses; and advanced nuclear power. The report modelled options for society to 2050. It concluded that if decisions are made early, the cost of climate neutrality can be held down to 1-2% of national wealth - GDP. Scenarios rely on some technologies still in their infancy, which will be controversial. For instance, it draws heavily on burning energy crops, capturing the carbon emissions and burying them underground. It says hydrogen use will need to grow to supply industry, heat and heavy transport. Electricity generation will need to double with heavy reliance on solar power and offshore wind. Controversially, it calls for  small, modular nuclear reactors  to support three-quarters of heating in cities through district heating systems. Modular reactors are much smaller than conventional reactors, and brought to a site in a kit of parts to be assembled. It warns that livestock production for dairy and meat may need to be cut by 50% rather than the 20% currently envisaged by the Committee on Climate Change. And people will need to eat less meat and dairy by the same amount. The report\u2019s author, Scott Milne, said: \u201cWhichever pathway the UK takes, innovation, investment and inducements across low-carbon technology, land use and lifestyle are essential to achieve net zero. \"And there are massive economic opportunities for the UK to lead the world in these areas.\" However, the report warns that the public do not appear ready for substantial lifestyle changes. It warns, for instance, that if people\u2019s homes are better insulated, they may choose to spend the same amount on heating to deliver a warmer home. It says: \u201cEarly evidence suggests a general willingness to adopt new technologies (such as new heating or mobility) as long as these can deliver the same experiences as before.  \u201cConversely, approaching the subject of dietary change or aviation often elicits a more resistant and emotional response.\u201d Some experts will be critical of the report\u2019s expectation that new technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be rapidly adopted. A recent report said it was unrealistic to expect that carbon capture and hydrogen  will develop fast enough to achieve the net zero target. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told BBC News: \"The global response to coronavirus shows we can radically address crises if we put our minds to it. Meanwhile, the net zero date has not been put to the people of the UK. \"The science tells us that net zero by 2050 means a hell of a lot worse than giving up flying and red meat - people are dying now around the world as you read this due to governmental inaction.\" The report was not welcomed by the National Beef Association. Its spokesman Neil Shand told BBC News that scientific studies typically underestimate the role of livestock in capturing carbon in the soil. He said: \u201cIt does seem rather unfortunate that the report links beef production and aviation in this way.  \u201cThe timing is more than a little ironic; the shops are full of people panic-buying and it seems clear that the nation\u2019s food sector relies very heavily on imports, and the associated transport that brings them into the UK. \"Food produced on their own doorstep, using a system where animal and non-animal foods are symbiotic requires very little air travel, and makes excellent use of the resources our beautiful country provides. Foreign travel does not have the same necessity.\" In addition, a report from a group of environmentally-minded business leaders has called on the government to show increased ambition and delivery of carbon-cutting policies to get the UK on track to meet climate goals. It said there was an urgent need especially for policies to bring low-carbon heating to people's homes. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump has cast doubt on a report by his own government warning of devastating effects from climate change. Asked outside the White House about the findings that unchecked global warming would wreak havoc on the US economy, he said: \"I don't believe it.\" The report found that climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars annually and damage health. The Trump administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. This video can not be played He told reporters on Monday that he had \"read some of\" Friday's report, which was compiled with help from US government agencies and departments. Mr Trump said other countries must take measures to cut their emissions. \"You're going to have to have China and Japan and all of Asia and all these other countries, you know, it [the report] addresses our country,\" he said. \"Right now we're at the cleanest we've ever been and that's very important to me. \"But if we're clean, but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so good. \"So I want clean air, I want clean water, very important.\" Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused the Trump administration of trying to hide the report. The Trump administration tried to bury a federally-mandated climate change study by releasing it the Friday after Thanksgiving. Here's what they didn't want you to hear: The Fourth National Climate Assessment  outlines the potential impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. \"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,\" the report says. \"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.\" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \"to adapt to the changes that will occur\". In October,  President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a \"political agenda\" , telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was \"a hoax\". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: \"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.\" A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could be stopped only if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, BBC News, Copenhagen Scientists and officials are meeting in Denmark to edit what's been termed the \"most important document\" on climate change. The IPCC Synthesis Report will summarise the causes and impacts of - and solutions to - rising temperatures. It will be the bedrock of talks on a new global climate deal. But there are concerns that political battles could neuter the final summary.  Over the past 13 months, the  IPCC has released  three major reports on the physical science, the impacts and the potential methods of dealing with climate change. On Sunday they will release the Synthesis Report. This new study is meant to take the most important elements of all three and blend them into something new. It is not meant to be a cut-and-paste exercise.  \"The new thing is there is going to be a stand-alone document that will be the most important for policymakers for the next few years,\" Prof Arthur Petersen, a UCL researcher and member of the Dutch government's team at the Copenhagen meeting, told BBC News.  \"It will be the document for the Paris summit.\" The UN hopes to deliver a  new global treaty on climate change  at a meeting in the French capital at the end of 2015. The IPCC Synthesis Report will, in the eyes of many, play a critical role in that. \"It is the last word that science will have in this process,\" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists, who is also attending the Copenhagen meeting as an observer.  \"So it is important that they get it right and make it as relevant to policymakers as possible.\" A draft of the report, seen by the BBC, underlines once again the near certainty of scientists about warming and man's role in it.  Continued emissions of greenhouse gases, it warns, increase \"the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems\". The authors reiterate that each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.  The period between 1983 and 2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years, according to the draft.  During this meeting the scientists and government officials will engage in a word-by-word review of the Summary, a document about 30 pages in length. Concerns have been raised about the role of the government representatives here in Copenhagen.   There have been worries that they are trying to steer the science in a certain direction, to reflect their negotiating positions in the UN climate talks.  One insider told BBC News that the chair of the IPCC, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, had to remind the delegates at one point that they were working on a summary for policymakers, not by them.  \"They are there to make sure that there is nothing in a document that their government approved that is inconsistent with their government's negotiation position,\" said the person with knowledge of the proceedings. In this series of reports, the IPCC introduced, for the first time, the concept of a \"carbon budget\".  They worked out the amount of greenhouse gases that the world could emit to raise global temperatures by no more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.  In Working Group III, issued in Berlin in April, they reported that two-thirds of that budget had been used up by 2011. But attempts to include this idea in the Synthesis Report have faced considerable opposition from political representatives from a number of countries, including India and the USA. India sees coal as playing a big part in attempts to get people out of poverty. A global limit on emissions, they argue, would interfere with that.  \"It would mean many of the development programmes would need to be curtailed, if carbon budgets put an embargo on providing basic necessities to people, that would be a big concern for India,\" said Sanjay Vashist from the campaign group Climate Action Network. Another point of contention between the developed and developing world is the question of responsibility and impact.  Essentially poorer nations would like the language of the document to reflect the fact that they didn't cause this problem but they will suffer the most from rising temperatures. \"We are not all facing the same situation,\" according to Sanjay Vashist. \"The IPCC has already predicted above 2 degrees C for South Asia, that means the disasters will be more threatening compared to other regions. \"Even if you tweak the scientific findings, it doesn't change that reality and the reality is we are facing a bleak future in absence of any ambition on mitigation and that needs to be addressed.\" There is some sense that the voices of developing countries have been getting stronger over the past 13 months as the IPCC has worked through the three reports. According to Arthur Petersen of the Dutch government's team, that's a good thing. \"It gives strong signals to the scientific community that the whole development perspective is still a blind spot for the more modelling oriented people - do they really have a feel for what's going on in those countries? \"But there is still a general sense and feeling that we should be able to reach an agreement where scientists and governments are happy - we can pull off the miracle again!\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc Europe 'will fail to protect climate' MPs bicker over climate report Climate impacts report: Key findings \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change is set to cause major changes across the world: sea levels will rise, food production could fall and species may be driven to extinction. The UN has warned that the world needs to limit climate change to below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But scientists say that keeping to the 1.5C target will require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" in all aspects of society. So how warm has the world got and what can we do about it? The world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation,  according to the World Meteorological Organization  (WMO). The global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA (If you can't see this chart tap or click  here )  The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with  2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says. If this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100. One degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger. Almost 400 all-time high temperatures were set in the northern hemisphere during the summer of 2019.  Records were broken in 29 countries for the period between 1 May and 30 August. A third of the all-time high temperatures were in Germany, followed by France and the Netherlands. These European records were set amid heatwaves across the continent that sent temperatures soaring in June and July. Over the period shown on the map below (May to August 2019), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began. \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         More than 30 all-time records were broken in the US, according to the Berkeley Earth data. In Japan, where 11 people died as a result of the summer heatwave, 10 all-time temperature highs were set. If we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that are party to the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century. Over the past few years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change. For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.  Countries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\". But scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C. The countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the  European Commission's Joint Research Centre  and  PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. US environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda. President Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate change agreement. Mr Trump said the deal struck in 2015 would disadvantage US businesses and workers. Almost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia,  a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found.  And it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face \"extreme\" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change.  The extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012. Sea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s,  according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee. The Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said. The extent of Arctic sea ice in 2019 was tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest on record. The maximum extent, reached in March 2019, was tied with 2007 as the seventh lowest in the 40-year satellite record. While governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too.  Scientists say we all have to make major changes to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change. The IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product. One of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat -  according to recent studies .  Scientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts.  A  recent study published in the journal Science  highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures. Crucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way. But as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices  need to change significantly to benefit the environment. By Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford, Lucy Rodgers, David Brown and Paul Rincon Correction 24 February 2020: A previous version of this story said that \"the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The year 2018 is on course to be the fourth warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization. It says that the global average temperature for the first 10 months of the year was nearly 1C above the levels between 1850-1900.  The State of the Climate report says that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the 2015-2018 making up the top four. If the trend continues, the WMO says temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100. The temperature rise for 2018 of 0.98C comes from five independently maintained global data sets.  The WMO says that one of the factors that has slightly cooled 2018 compared to previous years was the La Ni\u00f1a weather phenomenon which is associated with lower than average sea surface temperatures. Researchers say now that  a weak El Ni\u00f1o  is expected to form in early 2019 which might make next year warmer than this one.  \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         Regardless of the impacts of these events, scientists say the long-term warming trend has continued in 2018 and they point to sea level rise, ocean acidification and glacier melt as examples of climate change.  \"We are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.  \"Greenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5C by the end of the century,\" he said. This video can not be played \"It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,\" said Mr Taalas.  The WMO report says that for the most recent decade, 2009-2018, the average temperature increase was 0.93C above the pre-industrial baseline which is defined as being between 1850-1900. For the past five years, the average was 1.04C. \"These are more than just numbers,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.  \"Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life. \"It makes a difference to economic productivity, food security, and to the resilience of our infrastructure and cities. It makes a difference to the speed of glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. Every extra bit matters.\" The WMO report highlights some of the significant events of 2018. In the Indian state of Kerala more than five million people were affected by floods. Similarly in Japan, hundreds of people were killed by flooding. There were also heat waves in large parts of Europe including the UK leading to wildfires in some places including Scandinavia.  In July and August there were numerous record high temperatures north of the Arctic Circle.  Helsinki saw 25 consecutive days with temperatures above 25C. There were major wildfires in the US with the Camp Fire in November claiming the most lives of any fire in over a century in the US.  Greece also had fatalities from fires, while British Columbia broke its record for the most land burned in a fire season. Scientists involved in preparing the report say that the fingerprint of climate change can now be more clearly seen. \"The warming caused by these greenhouse gas emissions is already clear at the global scale,\" said Prof Tim Osborn from the University of East Anglia, who provided some of the data used in the WMO analysis. \"The knock-on effects for our regional climates and for severe weather events are beginning to emerge from the background variability of our weather.\"  The WMO State of the Climate report is one of a plethora of recent scientific studies that are designed to inform delegates to next week's UN climate talks in Poland. Negotiators will attempt to finalise the rule book of the Paris climate pact and to increase their commitments to cut carbon. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Despite the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, the world mustn't forget the \"deeper environmental emergency\" facing the planet. That's the view of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in remarks released to celebrate Earth Day. The toll taken by the virus is both \"immediate and dreadful\", Mr Guterres says. But the crisis is also a wake-up call, \"to do things right for the future,\" said the Secretary General. Mr Guterres re-iterated his view that the coronavirus is the biggest challenge the world has faced since the Second World War. But as the world commemorates  the 50th anniversary of Earth Day , the planet's \"unfolding environmental crisis\" is an \"even deeper emergency\", he says. \"Biodiversity is in steep decline,\" Mr Guterres stated. \"Climate disruption is approaching a point of no return. \"We must act decisively to protect our planet from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption.\" A long-term advocate of strong action to tackle global heating, Mr Guterres is now proposing six climate-related actions that should shape the recovery after the virus. The world has to deliver new jobs and businesses through a \"clean, green transition\". Taxpayers' money, when it is used, \"needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth\". Money must be used to make people and societies more resilient to climate change, he says. \"Public funds should be used to invest in the future not the past.\" Fossil fuel subsidies from governments is a theme that Mr Guterres has highlighted many times. These must end he says, and polluters must pay for their pollution. The world will need to work together, says the Secretary General, and climate risks will need to be factored into the financial system and be at the heart of all public policy. The links between climate change and the coronavirus have also been highlighted by many observers and experts in the field. \"While the pandemic will lead to a temporary dip in global greenhouse gas emissions, this must not distract from the urgent need for rapid fundamental changes in infrastructure, energy, land use and industrial systems to set us on a path to net zero emissions globally by 2050 at the latest,\" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). \"Land use change and deforestation are primary global drivers of biodiversity destruction. They heighten the risk of further pandemics by bringing humans into contact with new threats such as the coronavirus.  Every species lost is an irreversible event that decreases the resilience of natural and human systems on a permanent basis.\" On the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which was first established on April 22 1970, many researchers are keen to highlight how the threats to the planet have grown over time. \"The Covid-19 pandemic is a reminder that our existence on Earth is fragile,\" said Dr Karen O'Neill, from Rutgers University in the US. \"Environmentalism since that first Earth Day has expanded to recognise links between human health and ecosystems.\" \"Degraded environments and pollution make us more likely to encounter novel viruses and to be more vulnerable to those viruses when they start to circulate.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Just a day after the President of Chile said his country could no longer hold the world's annual climate conference, Spain has offered to host it in Madrid. The critical meeting, called COP25, was due to take place in Santiago for two weeks from 3 December. Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said his government needed \"to prioritise re-establishing public order\" after serious anti-government protests. Spain's offer will be considered by the UN's climate body next week. The Spanish government said it considered multilateral action on climate change to be a priority for the UN. The annual Conference of the Parties (COP) is usually an important moment for taking stock of where the world stands on climate change.  For a quarter of a century, negotiators from almost 200 countries have gathered to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising temperatures.  However, COP25 has become a problem with country after country finding reasons not to host.  COP25 was originally supposed to be held in Brazil. But in November last year, just two months after being announced as the summit's host nation, then President-elect Jair Bolsonaro pulled out. Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrest The far-right leader said this was due to the change of government and budget restrictions, according to local media.  However, he had recently chosen a foreign minister who claimed \"climate alarmism\" was just a plot by \"cultural Marxists\". A month later, Chile was selected to host the climate conference instead. Costa Rica, the other frontrunner, withdrew because of the costs involved in hosting. With tens of thousands of delegates making plans to travel to Chile for the meeting, the abrupt cancellation on Wednesday by President Pi\u00f1era was a real shock. Citing the need for public safety, he withdrew his country's offer to host both the COP and the Apec meeting, where President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping were due to meet.  Many involved in climate negotiations presumed that the meeting would take place in Bonn, Germany, home to the UNFCCC secretariat, at some point in the near future. Now, according to a statement from acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Spain has volunteered Madrid as an alternative location. The Chileans have accepted and are recommending it to the UN. It seems that Chile will still hold the presidency of the COP but it will simply be held in Spain, if the UNFCCC agrees.  There is a precedent for this approach, with the 2017 COP23 held in Bonn, but it was presided over by Fiji.  Around 25,000 people are expected to attend the summit.  One of the most celebrated is Greta Thunberg who had crossed the ocean by yacht in order to travel to Chile in the most low-carbon manner.  She is now in Los Angeles - it remains to be seen if she will be able to get to Madrid on time if the Spanish capital is accepted as the new home of COP25. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's global climate lead, said: \"It's a shame that COP25 won't be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region.  \"But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice considering these often take more than a year to organise.  \"But it shows how important countries view the UN process for tackling climate change that they are prepared to do all they can to keep the talks on track.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Joel Gunter BBC News The Falcon Heavy's boosters burned for 154 seconds before they were jettisoned into space. Free from the main body of the rocket, they spun 180 degrees and arced back towards the earth, burning their engines again as they descended to Cape Canaveral, to land, smoothly, improbably upright, within a second of one other.  Meanwhile, the main rocket pushed on, preparing to bring the world an even less credible sight. Four minutes into the flight, the nose cone broke apart to reveal its payload: a cherry-red electric sports car, with the top down, in space - a PR stunt for the ages. It was all brought to you by Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Paypal, electric car company Tesla, and SpaceX, the manufacturer of the Falcon Heavy. The partly-reusable Heavy is the most powerful rocket on earth, and, if Mr Musk is to be believed, a stepping stone to a rocket to Mars. The sports car in the nosecone was one of Mr Musk's own Tesla Roadsters. Its stereo was programmed to play David Bowie's Space Oddity on repeat as it travels for millions of years through space. Or until the battery dies, anyway. \"It's kind of silly and fun,\" he conceded, \"but silly and fun things are important.\" In the 12 years since Mr Musk sold online payments firm Paypal for $1.5bn, he has evolved in the public imagination into a kind of mad genius figure - part industrialist, part scientist, part playboy, part superhero. He has dated and married famous actresses, including Talulah Riley and Amber Heard, and had a rumoured fling with Cameron Diaz. Robert Downey Jr took inspiration from him to play Tony Stark in Iron Man. He has cornered private space flight and the electric car industry, ventured into solar energy and artificial intelligence, and promised super-high speed magnetic train travel, in a tube, underground. Oh, and he plans to colonise Mars. Most take Mr Musk's more wild ambitions and boasts with a galaxy-sized pinch of salt. His companies have missed deadline after deadline and recorded massive losses. But climate change campaigners have hailed the unexpected popularity of Tesla's electric cars, and the launch of the Falcon Heavy capped a string of successes for SpaceX. This video can not be played It all began in Pretoria, South Africa. As a young boy, he was obsessed with science fiction novels and more or less anything you could run a current through. His parents, Maye, a model, and Errol, an engineer, separated when he was eight. His younger brother and sister would stay with their mother, so he volunteered to go with their father. It did not go well. He later recalled returning home after vicious bullying at school, \"and it would just be awful there as well\". At 17, he moved to Canada to study physics and economics at Ontario's Queen's University. From Canada he migrated to the US in 1992, transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, and from Pennsylvania to a PhD in energy physics at Stanford in California, After two days, he quit. Instead he founded Zip2, an online newspaper platform, with his younger brother Kimbal. In 1999 they sold the company to Compaq for $300m, and Mr Musk ploughed his share into an online bank, X.com. X.com became Paypal, and in 2002 Paypal sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Aged 31, Mr Musk netted $165m. By that time, Mr Musk was two years into a marriage to Justine Wilson, an aspiring fantasy writer he met in Ontario. Mr Musk asked her out for ice cream. She agreed but then blew him off. He showed up in the student centre, where she was studying, with two cups of ice cream.  \"He's not a man who takes no for an answer,\"  Ms Wilson recalled in Marie Claire magazine . He is said to be a relentless worker. When he founded Zip2, he reportedly worked all day, slept in the office, and showered over the road at the YMCA. Asked in 2010 what advice he would give entrepreneurs, he suggested they should \"put in 80 to 100-hour weeks every week\". \"If other people are putting in 40-hour work weeks, and you're putting in 100-hour work weeks, you'll achieve in four months what takes them a year,\" he said. As they danced at their wedding, Justine later recalled, he told her: \"I am the alpha in this relationship\". He was a controlling husband, she said, pushing her to dye her hair more and more blonde. \"I am your wife,\" she recalled saying, \"not your employee.\" \"If you were my employee,\" he would reply, \"I would fire you.\" Their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - a tragedy that Mr Musk refused to talk about, she said. They went on to have five more children - twins and a set of triplets - via IVF, but she struggled with depression over the death of their first son. Eight years after they married, they divorced, in a messy, multi-million dollar separation. Six weeks later, he texted her to say he was engaged to Talulah Riley, a British actress 14 years his junior.  \"I will never be happy without having someone,\" he told Rolling Stone . \"Going to sleep alone kills me.\"  He and Ms Riley married in 2010. They divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013. In 2014 he filed for, then withdrew, a second divorce and in 2016 she filed for divorce and it took. After the sale of Paypal in 2002, Mr Musk ploughed his $165m into three new companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and a solar energy company called Solar City. Tesla was a quixotic venture, a niche electric car company in a nation addicted to gas.  With Mr Musk as CEO, the company set out a top-down plan - first, market a high-performance sports car, a machine that would set Tesla apart from a stereotype of small, underpowered electric vehicles. Then a luxury sedan, and finally a low-cost, mass-market electric car. A $456m loan from the US government saved Tesla from near-bankruptcy in 2008, and in 2010 it became the first American car company to float on the stock market since Ford in 1956. In 2017, it surpassed Ford and General Motors to become, briefly, the most valuable car company in the country. It was the market betting on a greener future, and not a reflection of Tesla's bottom line. Serious production delays on its low-cost Model 3 have compounded years of losses. On Wednesday, the day after its Roadster went interstellar, Tesla Inc landed with a bump. It reported a $675.4m (\u00a3487m) loss in the last quarter of 2017, more than five times worse than the previous year, although revenue climbed 44% to $3.3 billion. \"We were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,\" said Mr Musk on a conference call with analysts. It was a characteristic take for a man preoccupied with human extinction. A few hours earlier, he had announced on Twitter that the company's cosmic Roadster was en route to the asteroid belt, having overshot the trajectory for its planned Mars orbit. Then astronomers took a closer look at the data and concluded the car wouldn't make it that far. Not for the first time, SpaceX revised its projections. Over the past five or so years, Mr Musk has outlined varying plans and deadlines for his ultimate goal of sending humans to colonise the Red Planet. Late last year, he said he expected SpaceX to send a cargo mission in 2022, to lay groundwork, followed by a manned mission in 2024. The practical difficulties and dangers of sending humans 140 million miles to Mars are huge. Nasa has been more circumspect, putting its estimate for a manned mission somewhere in the mid-2030s. But the successes of SpaceX's more prosaic work - resupply missions to the space station, commercial satellite launches, Nasa and Air Force contracts - have propelled it to near the top of the list of the world's most valuable privately-held companies, with a $21.2bn valuation. The company has pioneered new reusable rocket technology, wowing the world, as on Tuesday, with the sight of pencil-like rockets gracefully descending to land with pinpoint accuracy, on land and at sea. It has undercut Nasa and major established rivals such as Boeing to provide (relatively) cheap space flight. And as SpaceX looks to the heavens, another of Mr Musk's companies is going underground. In October, the Boring Company won permission from the US government to dig a 10-mile test tunnel under Maryland.  Mr Musk hopes it will one day house the \"Hyperloop\", an electromagnetic bullet train he has boasted will carry passengers at up to 760mph (1223km\/h). In July, he tweeted that he had won \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop between New York and DC that would reduce the journey time from three hours to 29 minutes. Officials said no such approval had been given. The Hyperloop idea has its fair share of critics. Thom Neff, a civil engineer, put it succinctly when  he told Wired last year , \"I would put what Mr Musk is saying today in the bullshit category.\" A working Hyperloop is, without doubt, a long way off.  But to those who admire him, Mr Musk is a visionary, an irrepressible Howard Hughes-like figure revolutionising industry after industry. His two latest ventures, Neuralink and OpenAI, take him into the world of artificial intelligence.  His madcap ideas to save humanity from itself have even earned him the honour of a parody Twitter account, \"Bored Elon Musk\". On Tuesday, after one of Mr Musk's companies blasted a sports car into space and another reported record losses, his bored alter-ego put out a single tweet. \"Classic Tuesday,\" it said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent The Planet Earth-observation company has just released new imagery of the broken Milne Ice Shelf in the Arctic. Located on the northern margin of Canada's Ellesmere Island, the ice platform split on 30\/31 July to form a free-floating bloc some 80 sq km (30 sq miles) in area. By 3 August, this berg, or \"ice island\", had itself ruptured in two, with both segments then seen to drift out into the Arctic Ocean.  Ice shelves are the floating fronts of glaciers that have flowed off the land into the sea.  Ellesmere Island was once bounded by extensive shelves that had melded into a single structure. At the beginning of the 20th Century, this covered 8,600 sq km. But by the turn of the millennium, a rapidly warming climate had reduced and segmented the floating ice cover to just 1,050 sq km.  Further break-up events in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2012, and now in 2020, mean the shelf area is currently under 500 sq km. Milne itself now measures only 106 sq km.  The pictures from the Californian Planet company come from its Dove satellites. The imagery was acquired on 26 July (\"before\") and 31 July (\"after\"). Interesting to note are the numerous melt ponds that cover the surface of the shelf. The presence of such liquid water can be problematic for ice platforms.  If it fills crevasses, it can help to open them up. The water will push down on the fissures, driving them through to the base of the shelf in a process known as hydrofracturing. This will weaken an ice shelf. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk  and follow me on Twitter:  @BBCAmos \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath and Paul Rincon Science and environment, BBC News The Chilean official leading UN climate talks in Madrid has called on delegates to show flexibility, as they struggle to reach agreement on crucial measures needed to tackle climate change. The negotiations, which were scheduled to end on Friday, continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning.  Carolina Schmidt said a deal was almost there but the outcome needed to be ambitious.  The goal is a commitment to new carbon emissions cuts by the end of 2020. The European Union and small island states vulnerable to climate change are pushing for stronger commitments to cut those emissions. Some of the biggest polluters, including the United States, Brazil and India, say they see no need to change their current plans. Ms Schmidt, Chile's environment minister who is the conference's president, said early on Sunday: \"I request all the flexibility, all your strength to find this agreement to have an ambitious result.\" She added: \"It's hard, it's difficult but it's worth it. I specially need you. But people in our countries need us.\" On Saturday, a new draft text from the meeting was released, designed to chart a way forward for the parties to the Paris agreement, which came into being in 2015.  The pact's intention is to keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2C. This was regarded at the time as the threshold for dangerous global warming, though scientists subsequently shifted the definition of the \"safe\" limit to a rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The situation was unprecedented since talks began in 1991, said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. He commented: \"The latest version of the Paris Agreement decision text put forward by the Chilean presidency is totally unacceptable. It has no call for countries to enhance the ambition of their emissions reduction commitments.  \"If world leaders fail to increase ambition in the lead up to next year's climate summit in Glasgow, they will make the task of meeting the Paris agreement's 'well below 2C' temperature limitation goal - much less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - almost impossible.\" How big is the CO\u2082 bucket for 1.5\u00b0C? Well, the bucket is about to overflow in a few short years, unless we: 1. Turn off the tap (urgently) 2. Put a hole in the bottom to remove CO\u2082 (negative emissions) #COP25   #CarbonBudget   @FutureEarth   @gcarbonproject   https:\/\/t.co\/ycYcuFSPdF   pic.twitter.com\/o7JwZt7GlX His view was echoed by David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute (WRI). \"If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,\" he said. The conference in the Spanish capital has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. Responding to the messages from science and from climate strikers, the countries running this 26th conference of the parties (COP) meeting are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. But earlier in the meeting, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. At a \"stock-taking\" session on Saturday morning, Tina Stege, a negotiator with the Marshall Islands delegation, said: \"I need to go home and look my kids in the eye and tell them we came out with an outcome that will ensure their future.\" She added: \"The text must address the need for new and more ambitious NDCs and long-term goals. We can't leave with anything else.\" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, has been taking a hard line on promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. The deal saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. But India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. For many delegates, the deadlock is intensely frustrating in light of the urgent need to tackle emissions. \"I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action,\" said Alden Meyer. \"The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. Ministers here in Madrid must strengthen the final decision text, to respond to the mounting impacts of climate change that are devastating both communities and ecosystems all over the world.\" Jake Schmidt, from the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said: \"In Madrid, the key polluting countries responsible for 80% of the world's climate-wrecking emissions stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year. \"The mute majority must step up, and ramp up, their commitments to tackle the growing climate crisis well ahead of the COP26 gathering.\"  Also on Saturday, activists staged a protest outside the summit venue to express their frustration at what they see as the failure of world leaders in taking meaningful action on climate change.

Greater Manchester Police said the 24-year-old was approached by a man with a knife in Rudheath Avenue, Withington at about 13:30 BST on Saturday. She suffered wounds to her leg in the attack and was taken to hospital where she is in a stable condition. A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is being questioned by detectives. The woman's child was assessed at the scene by the emergency services and had no visible injuries. Police earlier issued images of a man they wanted to question about the attack, who was last seen making off on foot on to Bromborough Avenue and then continuing in the direction of Whitchurch Road. Det Insp John Robb said: \"This was a vicious attack in which a woman was stabbed in front of her young son.  \"Our thoughts are with her and her family as she recovers from this shocking ordeal. \"I would like to reassure the public that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are not currently looking for anyone else in relation to this attempted murder.\" Why not follow BBC North West on  Facebook ,  Twitter  and  Instagram ?

{"id":null,"body":"By David Reid Innovators This video can not be played Until you see it, it is difficult to conceive how much work many Rajasthani girls have to do before they go to school.  For some, their chores take precedence and school is a last priority. But one organisation is pushing to encourage up to three million girls to see just how studying can change their lives forever.  Bhagwanti Lassi Ram's typical day starts early with cooking flat roti bread; she delicately flips the bread, careful not to scorch her fingertips on the smoking hot plate.  Then it is off to feed the chickens and wash the cooking vessels.  All the time her father reminds her - and us - of her next chore.  \"She needs to take the goats to the field,\" he says, \"they can't wait\".  Eventually she's free to pull a comb through her hair, fold her neck scarf into a sharp \"V\" at the front as schoolgirls do here and heave her bag onto her back for the 4km (2.4 miles) trip to school.  \"Many girls in our village don't go to school because it's too far,\" she says.  \"If we had a school that taught children up to the age of 15 in our village, more girls would study.\" she adds.  \"Girls are scared to go to school, as you have to cross a highway where many drunk drivers pass by.\" In letting his daughter go to school, Bhagwanti's father is pretty progressive compared to many others in the village.  The group, Educate Girls, runs teams of volunteers who go into villages to find the girls who are not in school. They talk to families about the importance of sending girls to school and draw up a plan with the community to enrol them. The volunteers work with schools to make sure they are equipped with toilets - they also tutor girls and run classes in English, Maths and Hindi.  So far they have helped millions of children and been responsible for enrolling 150,000 girls at school.  Meena Bhati from Educate Girls, takes us to a house where four girls in the family were married at an early age.  Now a fifth has been taken out of school after being married off at the age of 14. \"Here parents feel there is no point educating a girl,\" says Meena. \"She's there to do housework, and look after cattle and take care of younger children, while the parents go to work as farmers or labourers. For a girl, education is a waste of time.\" Safeena Husain, who set up Educate Girls believes she could only do whatever she wanted to in life because of her education. There are estimated to be three million girls aged 10-14 not in school in India.  The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia. Learn more about  BBC Innovators . One of the main things holding other girls back from getting an education is early marriage.  \"In Rajasthan, 50-60% of girls are married below the age of 18. A lot of children - about 10-15% - are married below the age of 10,\" Safeena says. According to Unicef, India has more child brides than any other country. Nearly half of all living Indian women were married below the official legal age of 18. One member of the Educate Girls team with first-hand insight into the pressures many of these girls live with is Neelam Vaishnav. She was married off at 14 to her sister-in-law's brother.  According to tradition she moved in with her husband's family, but with the understanding that she would be able to continue going to school. When they reneged on that promise, she decided it was time to bring the marriage to an end.   \"When I decided to get divorced I faced lot of problems. Everyone in the village kept taunting me, calling me names. They still do it in fact. My in-laws accused me of being characterless and having no shame.\" Meanwhile at school Bhagwanti is looking to the future: \"I want to become a teacher after studying and teach other girls because when you are educated you have courage,\" she says. \"If I can stand on my own feet and find a job, I'll be able to support my family financially.\" This is music to the ears of Safeena who strongly believes that because women play such a crucial role in families' health and nutrition, educating girls would solve many of India's most pressing problems. According to  Unesco , every extra year of education a mother has reduces infant mortality by 5-10% and raises her lifetime earnings by 20%. \"You name any development indicator and it can be improved by girls education - so actually girls are the greatest asset we have,\" she says.

{"id":null,"body":"Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election riding on one simple phrase: \"Make America Great Again\".  As he seeks a second term, he faces a country struggling with challenges from the coronavirus and the pandemic's economic aftershocks - and an electorate that will weigh his record from his four years in office.  His 2020 pitch is to bring back the economy, boost jobs,  protect US trade interests, and to continue with his hard-line stance on immigration.  Here in detail is where the candidate stands on eight key issues. President Trump has long campaigned on \"America First\" principles, and has pushed for bringing jobs and manufacturing back to the US.  During his first campaign, Mr Trump promised huge tax cuts for working Americans, to lower the corporate tax rate, to shake up the trade status quo and to revive American manufacturing.  On some of those, he has delivered.  In the last four years, he has rolled back federal regulations on businesses, enacted corporate and income tax cuts and signed executive orders supporting preferences for domestic-made products.  Since January 2017, the US has added more than 480,000 manufacturing jobs, though analysts say growth in the sector is slowing down and Mr Trump's related policies - like tariffs - have not addressed the structural issues at play.  Mr Trump has also predicted the economy will bounce back immediately after the pandemic - though critics say his Covid-19 response has caused long-term economic damage. Mr Trump first campaigned on the promise the US should put focus on its own economic interests though he has said \"America First\" does \"not mean \"America alone\". On trade, Mr Trump has taken a hard-line stance on China, coupled with a policy to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition - and those remain the key aspects of his trade policy.  Throughout his first term, the president emphasised his work renegotiating past trade deals he says were unfair to the US - like Nafta, between the US, Canada, and Mexico  - or leaving them outright - like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. On the 2016 campaign trail, he also promised to fix the US trade deficit (the gap between imports v exports), which, for the first time in six years did decline in 2019, though economists disagree on whether this suggests an improvement in the economy.  President Trump's ongoing trade war with China has raised border taxes on close to $500bn of annual trade, and this year's \"phase one\" deal between the two nations saw most of the tariffs remain in place.  In August, he said he wants to offer tax credits to entice US firms to move factories out of China , saying \"we will end our reliance on China\".  Mr Trump has also imposed tariffs on goods from the European Union - from steel to French wine - has threatened tariffs on steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina, and recently re-imposed tariffs on some Canadian aluminium products.  As with trade, Mr Trump has also promised to put \"America First\" in US foreign policy.  In the White House's words, that means \"reasserting American sovereignty and the right of all nations to determine their own futures\", with a focus on ensuring security and prosperity.  What has that meant in practice?  It has included stepping away from some large multilateral agreements like the Paris climate accord or pulling back from some multilateral organisations, like the World Health Organization. He has challenged some international alliances, pushing for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) members to boost their defence spending in the military alliance. And he has recently reiterated a promise to bring down US troop levels overseas - which are currently at about the same level as when he took office - specifically in places like Germany and Afghanistan.  Critics have said he has created tensions with historically close US allies while reaching out to adversaries like North Korea and Russia.  He has had foreign policy successes, recently helping to broker a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalise relations.  And he has touted the killings of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, and Iran's powerful military commander, Gen Qasem Soleimani. Promises to curb immigration levels have been foundational to the president's political career.  Now, as he seeks re-election he has promised to continue the construction of a border wall on the US-Mexico border - he has so far secured funding for 445 miles (716 km) of the 722 mile barrier. He also vows to eliminate the visa lottery and chain migration - meaning immigration to the US that is based on family ties - and shift to a \"merit-based\" entry system.  Mr Trump's plans for immigration reform faced defeat this summer when the Supreme Court ruled against his administration's bid to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), which protects about 650,000 young people who entered the US without documents as children.  Mr Trump campaigned in 2016 on repealing the Affordable Care Act, brought in by former President Barack Obama.  Though falling short of a complete repeal, the administration has succeeded in undoing parts of that law including a repeal of the individual mandate, which required people to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.  President Trump has also promised to bring down drug prices in the US, and in July brought in measures that would allow discounts and import of cheaper drugs from abroad, though some industry analysts have said they would not have much effect.  He declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency in 2017 and offered $1.8bn in federal funding to states for prevention, treatment and recovery measures. He has also taken steps to restrict opioid prescribing.  But critics say his ongoing efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which expanded healthcare coverage to millions, is detrimental to battling the opioid crisis. Since he took office, Mr Trump has rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways across the country, fulfilling a campaign promise from 2016.  He also withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement, saying the deal disadvantaged the US \"to the exclusive benefit of other countries\". That withdrawal will only be formally completed after November's election.  Most recently, his administration approved oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has been off-limits for drilling for decades.   President Trump has touted the First Step Act as a key step he made towards criminal justice reform.  The 2018 bipartisan bill was significant, and reformed laws at the federal level, giving judges more discretion during sentencing as well as strengthening prisoner rehabilitation efforts.  Mr Trump had also promised a follow-up Second Step Act that would address employment barriers for former prisoners, though no such legislation has been proposed thus far.  During his 2016 campaign, Mr Trump branded himself as a firm advocate of law enforcement and has remained so during his presidency, most recently escalating his support of police amid the nationwide protests against racial injustice. In June, President Trump signed an executive order introducing several police reforms, offering federal grants for improved practices, including the creation of a database to trace abuses by officers.  The president has said that controversial chokehold methods for restraining suspects should be prohibited \"generally speaking\", but has not moved to enforce a ban.  After the US was rocked by mass shootings in Texas and Ohio in 2019, Mr Trump expressed support for a series of reforms, like tighter background checks for gun buyers and \"red flag laws\", which block access to firearms for those who are deemed a risk to society.  But after this initial flurry of interest, Mr Trump has done little to move these ideas forward. The president has instead continued his vocal defence of the US constitution's Second Amendment - which preserves Americans' right to bear arms - and of the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA).

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent A record-breaking heatwave in Siberia would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change,  a study has found . The Russian region's temperatures were more than 5C above average between January and June of this year. Temperatures exceeded 38C in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June, the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle. The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average. An international team of climate scientists, led by the UK Met Office, found the record average temperatures were likely to happen less than once every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change. That makes such an event \"almost impossible\" had the world not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions, they conclude in the study. The scientists described the finding as \"unequivocal evidence of the impact of climate change on the planet\". It is, says co-author Prof Peter Stott of the Met Office, the strongest result of any attribution study to date. This video can not be played Attribution studies attempt to work out the role that human-induced climate change plays in major weather events. Climate scientists use computer simulations to compare the climate as it is today with the climate as it would have been without human influence to see how likely different weather events would have been. The researchers say that the current Siberian heat \"has contributed to raising the world's average temperature to the second hottest on record for the period January to May\". The changing Arctic climate is of huge importance here in the UK. Four of the six main systems that determine this country's weather are driven by conditions in the Arctic, said Dr Katharine Hendry of Bristol University. She was one of the lead authors on a paper published last month that suggested a series of extreme weather events  could be linked to changes in the Arctic.  The so-called \"Beast from the East\", in the winter of 2018, is one. It involved Arctic air blasting the country, driving temperatures below 0C for several days. Over half a metre of snow fell in some areas. The storm is reckoned to have caused over \u00a31bn of damage and claimed 10 lives. The paper published last month also cites the storms and floods in February this year and ones back in 2015 as other possible examples of Arctic-linked changes. \"The link between the Arctic and UK weather is through the jet stream,\" said Prof Stott, referring to the ribbon of fast-moving air high up in the atmosphere. The jet stream helps move weather systems around the globe.  But sometimes it creates \"blocking\" patterns that can cause weather systems to stall. The unusually sunny spring experienced in the UK this year was caused by a blocking pattern that allowed high pressure systems to dominate the UK for months on end. The heatwave in Siberia was caused by the same pattern but with even more dramatic results. The extreme temperatures led to a cascade of natural and human disasters which prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to declare a state of emergency in early June. A vast fuel spill was caused by the collapse of a reservoir containing 20,000 tonnes of diesel near the Russian city of Norilsk in late May. This video can not be played Arctic wildfires are estimated to have led to the release of 56 megatonnes of CO2 in June. At the same time, there has been widespread melting of the permafrost and reports of unusually large swarms of Siberian silk moths that have damaged trees, making them more susceptible to fire. It is well-known that the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. Arctic temperatures are estimated to have risen 2C since 1850 compared with 1C globally. What impact that will have on the world's weather is less certain. \"Looking at the geological record, we don't think we've had CO2 levels as high for about five million years,\" said Dr Hendry. \"So we really don't know what to expect into the future.\" \"We are,\" she said, \"in uncharted territory\". This year's Siberian heatwaves shows just how extreme conditions can become. What worries many scientists is that this new climate era we are entering means many places now experience weather conditions beyond anything local ecosystems - or indeed human communities - have evolved to endure.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Cutting the speed of ships has huge benefits for humans, nature and the climate, according to a new report.  A 20% reduction would cut greenhouse gases but also curb pollutants that damage human health such as black carbon and nitrogen oxides.  This speed limit would cut underwater noise by 66% and reduce the chances of whale collisions by 78%. UN negotiators will meet in London this week to consider proposals to curb maritime speeds.  Ships, of all sorts and sizes, transport around 80% of the world's goods by volume. However they are also responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions thanks to the burning of fuel. Shipping generates roughly 3% of the global total of warming gases - that's roughly the same quantity as emitted by Germany.   While shipping wasn't covered by the Paris climate agreement, last year  the industry agreed  to cut emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.  This  new study , carried out for campaign groups Seas at Risk and Transport & Environment builds on existing research that suggests that slowing down ships is a good idea if you want to curb greenhouse gases.  The report though also considers a range of other impacts of a speed cut such as on air pollution and marine noise.  As ships travel more slowly they burn less fuel, which means there are also savings in black carbon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The last two in particular have serious impacts on human health, particularly in cities and coastal areas close to shipping lanes. The report found that cutting ship speed by 20% would cut sulphur and nitrogen oxides by around 24%. There are also significant reductions in black carbon, which are tiny black particles contained in the smoke from ship exhausts. Cutting black carbon helps limit climate warming in the Arctic region because when ships burn fuel in the icy northern waters, the particles often fall on snow, and restrict its ability to reflect back sunlight, which accelerates heating in the Arctic region.  The study also says that a 20% cut in speed would reduce noise pollution by two thirds - while the same speed limitation would reduce the chances of a ship colliding with a whale by 78%. \"It's a massive win, win, win, win,\" said John Maggs from Seas at Risk. \"We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature,  we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money. \"It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling.\" Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London.  Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions. One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it.   Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down. \"Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,\" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner. But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade. \"Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,\" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate.   \"We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships.\" What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions.  Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming.  \"The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,\" said John Maggs.   \"We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen  Briggs BBC News Many species will not be able to adapt fast enough to survive climate change, say scientists. A study of more than 50 plants and animals suggests their ability to adapt to changes in rainfall and temperature will be vastly outpaced by future climate change. Amphibians, reptiles and plants are particularly vulnerable, according to US researchers. And tropical species are at higher risk than those in temperate zones. Some animals might be able to move geographically to cope with rising temperatures, but others live in isolated areas where they cannot move, such as in nature reserves or on mountains or islands.  Ecologists analysed how quickly species had changed their climatic niches (the conditions where they can survive) over time, and how these rates compared with that of global warming.  They analysed populations of plants and animals, including insects, amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles. Rates of change in climatic niches were much slower than rates of projected climate change, by more than 200,000 fold for temperature (on average), they said.  \"Overall, our results show that rates of climatic niche change among populations of plants and animals are dramatically slower than projected rates of future climate change,\" said Tereza Jezkova and John Wiens, of the University of Arizona. Mammals and birds might be better placed to survive than amphibians and reptiles, because they had the ability to regulate their own body temperatures, said Dr Wiens. And, while some species might be able to move to higher latitudes or elevations to survive, \"for a lot of organisms, that is not an option\". \"It's a double jeopardy of climate change and habitat destruction,\" he told BBC News.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists. The  most comprehensive account  yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys.  But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again. They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis. They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility. In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged \u00a3250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans. The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do. Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation.  However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option. \"If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,\" he said. Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed.  Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2. They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions. During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day. The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined.  While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic.  China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India. If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%.  If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%.  But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge. Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal. He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road. Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed \"defeat devices\" to fool regulators. The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: \"We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'\". Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown. Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations. \"A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis. The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change.  When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.  She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables.  \"Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,\" she told BBC News. \"Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.\" \"So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.\" Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change.  A  letter signed by 155 major companies , representing $2.4 trillion (\u00a31.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis.  Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to \"prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy\". The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. It will take a a dramatic shift to change that.  \"I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.\" \"He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.\" \"It could go either way.\" The study has been  published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jack Goodman BBC Reality Check The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his government's stand on climate change as the country deals with devastating fires and a historic heatwave. Mr Morrison said his policies on reducing emissions would ensure what he called a \"vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment.\" Australia is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters, and there's been a long-running debate about the country's approach to climate change. So what is it doing to reduce emissions? Under the Paris Climate Agreement to tackle rising global temperatures, Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels. These goals have been criticised for being too low, and last year the United Nations (UN) reported that Australia was not on track. The UN found that:  \"There has been no improvement in Australia's climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the target.\"   About half of the G20 countries (those with the biggest economies), including Australia, are falling short.  The Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 57 countries  responsible for more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions on climate policy.  It highlighted the country's no-show at a UN climate summit in September and its withdrawal from an international fund to tackle climate change. The opposition Labor Party in Australia has said the government is \"refusing to act\" on climate change. However, the Australian government maintains it is on course to meet its 2030 commitments. \"Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets,\" according to Australian PM Scott Morrison. Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030, according to projections published in December. But it says it will meet the 2030 targets by counting the quantities of carbon already reduced under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol.   More important than specific targets - Australia as a fossil fuel producer has so far failed to acknowledge the need to plan for a world of net zero emissions, says Myles Allen, a climate change expert at the University of Oxford.  Net zero means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal. Australia is among the world's largest exporters of iron ore, uranium, coal and natural gas. It was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. Phasing out coal is considered crucial to limiting global warming to within 1.5C, but the Australian government is continuing to back the industry  for the role it plays in the economy. Facing criticism over his handling of the bushfires and response to climate change, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he will not make  \"reckless\" cuts to the coal industry. The government recently approved the construction of a  controversial new coal mine  - which could be the biggest in the world and would export coal to India.  A central climate plan is the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF).  The government put forward an additional A$2bn (\u00a31bn) spread over 15 years to help businesses and farmers reduce emissions, bringing up total investment to $4.5bn. The government says it will deliver 100 million tonnes of emissions reductions.  Though aspects of the ERF have been praised, \"Australia has adopted a piecemeal approach to emission reduction,\" said the OECD (an economic body which monitors richer, industrialised nations) in a 2019 report.  The government needs to show how existing instruments, such as the ERF, can be scaled up to reach Paris Agreement goals, added the report. Scientists round the world are looking aghast at the politics of climate change in Australia. It's one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet to rising temperatures, yet there is still denial about the impacts of rising CO2 levels on events like the current wildfires. There is no serious doubt among scientific institutions that rising global temperatures are leading to record heat. The heatwaves are driven by a natural phenomenon but they are adding to an already over-heated planet. In the election, the victorious Liberal (conservative) Party categorised climate change as a metropolitan fad for urban professionals, and gained support for the world's biggest coal mine.  Coal is the dirtiest fuel and scientists say we shouldn't be building more coal-fired power stations if we want to stabilise the climate.  This piece was originally published on 24 December 2019.

{"id":null,"body":"About 130,000 jobs could be created by transforming Scotland's economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Scottish Labour's leader. Richard Leonard said a \"Green new deal\" was needed to tackle both the economic crisis and climate crisis. His proposals include building 12,000 council homes each year and investing \u00a3100m in new electric buses. He also wants to employ and train a new workforce to restore the natural environment and tackle climate change. In a speech broadcast online, Mr Leonard said the pandemic should mark a \"turning point in the direction of Scotland's economy and its environmental impact\". He added: \"We cannot afford to return to business as usual - instead a green and just recovery must focus on tackling the economic crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. \"In Scotland we are blessed with an abundance of natural resources. We also have the will to change and to make things better.   \"So we must bring together all sectors and sections of our society, harnessing all our natural resources, all our workforce skills, and all our ambition to create a greener better future for us all.\" Mr Leonard's other proposals include: Mr Leonard said that \"bold\" proposals for housing, energy, infrastructure, environmental restoration and transport would create \"up to 131,000 new jobs\" in total. He added: \"Scotland faces a major economic and unemployment crisis.  \"Creating quality, well-paid jobs for good will be crucial not just to our recovery but to equipping our workforce - especially young workers - with the skills and opportunities they will need throughout their working lives.\" The proposals for the party's Green New Deal were drawn up by economist Laurie Macfarlane, and will form a key part of Scottish Labour's manifesto ahead of the Scottish Parliament election in May. Mr Leonard said he the election would be a chance for his party to \"win the fight for a fairer Scotland, a greener Scotland, a better Scotland\". And he accused the Scottish government of failing vulnerable older people in care homes during the pandemic, saying: \"Only 0.7% of the population live in our care homes, but almost 50% of all Covid-19 deaths have been in care homes\".   Mr Leonard said those responsible for moving some patients from hospitals to care homes  after they had tested positive for the virus  \"must face justice if necessary in a court of law\".   He was asked by journalists if this opened up the prospect of \"doctors and NHS managers being hauled before the courts on criminal charges\".  Mr Leonard said there was already evidence of families in Scotland preparing to take legal action \"because of the treatment of their elderly relatives in care homes\". The Scottish Labour leader added: \"The trail in some cases may rest at the level of the care home, in other cases it may rest at a higher level. \"Our continued concern has been the guidance that was issued in the name of the Scottish government, which dictated the policies and practices followed out in the field. \"There will, I think, be questions in the end that will need to be answered by government.\" He said it was time to accept once and for all that the country's \"fragmented\" care system was broken, and that a National Care Service should be created. Mr Leonard said this could create 25,000 quality jobs, and ensure that the care service was no longer treated by the Scottish government as a \"poor relation of the NHS\". He added: \"The way we value our older citizens says a lot about the kind of society that we are. It is time to care about care and restore dignity to our care system.\" The Scottish Greens claimed that Mr Leonard had copied its policies in his speech and attempted to pass them off as his own idea. The party's co-leader, Lorna Slater, said: \"The truth is Scottish Labour have no new ideas. Recycling Scottish Green ideas and trying to pass them off as their own won't impress the public.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives? \u201cMy face was stolen by Ukraine war scammers\u201d Video \u201cMy face was stolen by Ukraine war scammers\u201d Why was this freed Chibok girl treated differently?

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief Environment correspondent Good news is in short supply at the moment, so brace yourself for a rare burst of optimism about climate change.  World leaders know their countries face one of the most severe recessions in history thanks to the coronavirus restrictions. That presents a unique challenge, but also a massive opportunity. Politicians know they are going to need to spend huge amounts of money to kick-start economic activity as the threat of coronavirus finally recedes. It is a one-off, never-to-be-repeated chance to transform their economies. So the question is, what will they spend it on? This week the European Union put its cards on the table. On Wednesday it unveiled what it is billing as the biggest \"green\" stimulus package in history.  \"This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any one of us,\" announced Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, when she told European Parliament members what was planned.  \"This is Europe's moment,\" she said. As well as being  a big step towards federalism , the recovery package puts fighting climate change at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic.  The scale of what is being proposed is mind-boggling. The headline figure is \u20ac750bn, but add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost \u20ac2tn ($2.2tn). There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to decarbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.  The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. \"If we do not do it we will be taking much more risk,\" Teresa Ribera, the deputy Prime Minister of Spain told me. \"The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a short-cut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.\" If you are thinking this is just something that sandal-wearing European liberals might get behind, think again. Donald Trump may be an avowed supporter of fossil fuels, but his Democratic opponent in the November presidential election is not. Joe Biden is reckoned to be planning a similarly huge green stimulus package for the US. The model is the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. That was the defining policy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Biden is reportedly preparing for his own \"FDR-size presidency\",  according to New York magazine . \"He knows he needs youth enthusiasm, he knows he needs the left, he knows he needs the core democratic base, and he knows climate is probably the best issue to get that,\" explains energy and climate analyst David Roberts of the US website Vox. \"Climate polls the best across all those groups, climate even polls pretty well among wavering Trump voters,\"  he says . This is not just about rallying voters. There are sound economic reasons why politicians see green technology as a prudent investment. First off, renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world. The technologies are proven and can be built at scale today. And most importantly, their cost follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. The same logic applies to hydrogen and to electric vehicles. But it does not apply to fossil fuels, whose cost ultimately relies on mining ever more difficult and dwindling resources. And that contains the seductive promise that a huge government push to scale up solar and wind will make them even more affordable compared with coal, oil and gas - not just in the US, but globally. So the argument goes that renewables provide a pathway for clean growth in the future. Develop innovative new electric vehicles, wind turbines, ways of making homes energy-efficient, energy storage technologies or even new ways of configuring electricity grids and you are likely to find ready markets around the world in coming years. Equally importantly, renewable technologies offer something else that will be needed in the years to come: the potential to create huge numbers of new jobs. The Covid-19 crisis has driven joblessness to near Great Depression levels around the world - worse even than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Around 40 million Americans are unemployed. Worldwide, 1.6 billion people are reckoned to be in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods,  according to the International Labour Organisation . That means governments need to find ways to employ lots and lots of people. Renewable technologies offer precisely the kind of \"shovel-ready\", large-scale and labour-intensive infrastructure projects politicians are looking for. There is the obvious stuff - building wind turbines, solar farms and the foundations of a hydrogen economy - but think also about installing networks of charging points for electric vehicles, the need to insulate homes or revamp urban transport systems. Just like the road and dam building of the American New Deal, projects like these could employ tens of thousands of people in high-skilled and - crucially - local jobs. But here's the rub. China currently looks set to take a very different route to recovery. It remains the biggest piece of the climate change puzzle. China produces almost a third of the world's emissions, as much as the US and the EU combined. Last week, the country's top legislative body, the annual National People's Congress, was in full session. The country already has a big expansion of coal-fired electricity generation underway. There was no suggestion this would be reversed. After the financial crisis in 2008, China ramped up coal-fired power stations as a key part of its stimulus package. But there is still a lot to play for this time round, says Li Shuo, an energy expert with Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. Few details of the Covid recovery plan were announced at the NPC, and he says much will depend on what American voters decide in November. \"The US position looms very large in China's political calculus,\" explains Mr Li. He believes President Trump's energy policies are one of the major barriers to China raising its climate ambitions. \"I think there is a feeling here in China that it is unfair for Beijing to move forward with its climate agenda at the same time as the US is moving backwards.\" That said, the Chinese public certainly seems to support measures to decarbonise the economy. Eighty-seven percent of Chinese people see climate change as serious a threat as Covid-19, according to  a poll conducted in 14 countries by Ipsos MORI in April .  Even in America, where support was lowest, 59% of people agreed that the risks of climate change matched those of the coronavirus in the long term. Nearly two-thirds of all respondents and 57% of Americans said it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritised action on climate change. And once big economies like Europe and the US adopt policies like these, there is good reason to think other countries will follow suit. One of the most striking - and controversial - aspects of the European plan is that it will be funded in large part by debt raised by the European Commission itself. That represents a significant deepening or European integration that some member states have already signalled they will resist.  Under the proposal the hundreds of billions of euros of debt would be serviced by new EU-wide taxes. One option being discussed is a carbon tax that would include levies on imported goods with a high carbon footprint. Think about what that means. Countries that want to sell into the largest economy in the world would now face penalties unless they make efforts to clean up their energy systems. Now imagine that America embarks on a Green New Deal. It might choose to introduce a similar tariff. But I opened this piece offering optimism, so let me present an alternative path.  The countries that decarbonise first could lead by example. Remember, the more renewables you produce, the cheaper they get. As low carbon technologies increasingly undercut the fossil fuel alternatives, you won't need a stick to beat other countries into changing their ways - they will just follow the money. You see where this is headed.? Maybe we are not as far away from widespread coordinated action on climate change as many people fear. As I said at the start, a rare opportunity for optimism amongst the gloom of this present crisis.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen  Briggs BBC Environment Correspondent Scientists are calling on world leaders to sign up to an eight-point plan of action at landmark talks in Paris. The key element is the goal to limit global warming to below 2C by moving to zero carbon emissions by 2050. The UN meeting in December is \"the last chance\" to avert dangerous climate change, according to the  Earth League .  Scientific evidence shows this can be achieved, but only with bold action now, says an alliance of climate researchers from 17 institutions. The statement involves eight calls for action: Chair of the Earth League, Johan Rockstrom, of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden, said the statement set out the scientific stance on what needed to happen at the Paris talks. \"Six years after the failure at Copenhagen, the world now has a second chance to agree upon a safe pathway towards a future that does not undermine human well-being in the world.\" He said the statement summarised what the group of scientists believe has to happen at the Paris talks to avoid the risk of severe climate change linked with sea-level rise, heat waves, droughts and floods. \"The window is still open but just barely,\" he said. \"There is still an opportunity to transition into a safe, reasonably stable climate future.\" He added: \"The statement says very clearly that 2 degrees is the absolute upper limit that the world should aim for.\" The Earth League includes 17 scientific research institutions around the world, including two in the UK. Professor Sir Brian Hoskins of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College, London, said to achieve the goal, global carbon emissions would need to peak around 2020 and fall very rapidly to near zero by around 2050. He said rich countries would have to take the lead on this and help the less developed world. \"We're all in this together - we share one planet, we share one atmosphere, we share one climate system.\" The statement was released to coincide with Earth Day, an annual event to demonstrate support for environmental protection. WWF-UK said governments around the world must agree a fair deal at Paris, but should take action beyond this.  Head of climate and energy policy, Emma Pinchbeck, said: \"The next UK Government must reaffirm our leadership on this key international issue, and commit to decarbonising policy in line with the science.  \"When it comes to government action on climate change, we will benefit from ambition and will regret inaction.\" UN agrees draft text for Paris US makes climate pledge to UN A brief history of climate change Earth League - HOME Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Sweltering temperatures of up to 40C could be a regular occurrence in the UK by 2100 if carbon emissions stay very high says the Met Office. The current record stands at 38.7C, set in Cambridge last July. This new study  says there is an \"increasing likelihood\" of going beyond this figure, because of the human influence on the climate.  Under the worst emissions scenario, the 40C mark could occur every three and a half years by the end of this century. The past two summers have seen periods of significant and uncomfortable heat across much of the UK and Europe. Met Office researchers are clear that these hot summers occurred partly as a result of warming gases originating from human activities. In fact, the use of energy, transport and all the other carbon that we've been producing  made the heatwave of 2018 around 30 times more likely . The Met Office's new modelling study says that this human influence on UK temperatures is going to continue. \"We find that the likelihood of extremely warm days in the UK has been increasing and will continue to do so during the course of the century with the most extreme temperatures expected to be observed in the South-East of England,\" the report finds. The scale of the impact, though, is still very much in our hands.  Right now the chances of any part of the UK hitting 40C are extremely low - it could occur once every 100 to 350 years. This changes significantly by the end of the century, depending on how much more carbon is emitted.  The researchers say the chances of hitting that high mark are \"rapidly accelerating\" with a 40C day occurring every 3.5 years, under a very high emissions scenario. Under a more modest carbon projection, the 40C mark happens about once every 15 years.  \"If we think about the climate that we would have had, had we not emitted any greenhouse gases, and something like 40C looks looks well nigh impossible, because it is so extreme,\" said Prof Peter Stott from the Met Office, one of the paper's authors. \"But now we've already entered this scenario where we can see over 38C as we saw last summer, and increasingly the chances of seeing 40C become ever higher if we continue emitting greenhouse gases,\" he told BBC News. Some experts question the use of the most extreme carbon emissions scenario as being unrealistic. Prof Stott says that both the very high and the medium carbon projections used show a considerable chance of hitting 40C, and even the lower estimate significantly increases the chances of 40C compared to the present.  Even if the mercury doesn't go beyond the 40C mark, consistent high temperatures would have serious implications for elderly people. \"I think the main risk really is to vulnerable people, particularly elderly people who are vulnerable to such extremes,\" said Prof Stott. \"And when we're looking at extremes that we haven't seen before, then it's something to take very seriously because the buildings, the care homes, the homes that people are living in, are not necessarily adapted for such temperatures.\" The chances of hitting 40C are more likely in the South East of England, with temperatures above 35C becoming an almost annual occurrence by the end of the century.  But traditionally colder parts of the UK will also see a hike in temperatures, with many areas of the north exceeding 30C at least once per decade.  Co-author and head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre Dr Mark McCarthy, said: \"This research shows human-caused climate change has set us on a course to see temperature extremes in the UK that would be highly unlikely under a 'natural' climate, although urgent action to reduce emissions now can significantly reduce the occurrence of extreme high temperatures in the UK in the future. The study finds that if the world reduces carbon emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement, then the chances of hitting these dangerous temperatures are significantly reduced.  The research has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.  Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst May was the sunniest calendar month on record, and spring was the sunniest spring, the Met Office has said. The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rain in February.  Meteorologists say they are amazed at the sudden switch from extreme wet to extreme dry \u2013 it is not \"British\" weather. On average the UK gets 436 hours of sunshine between March and the end of May. Since 1929, only 10 years have had more than 500 hours. And none has got more than 555 hours.  Scientists say the recent weather in the UK has been unprecedented and astounding.  This year we've bathed in an extraordinary 626 hours - smashing the previous record by a \u201cstaggering\u201d amount, one Met Office worker said. It is because the jet stream has locked the fine weather in place, just as it locked the previous winter rainfall in place.  Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC News: \u201cWe\u2019ve swung from a really unsettled spell with weather systems coming in off the Atlantic to a very, very settled spell. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented to see such a swing from one extreme to the other in such a short space of time. That\u2019s what concerns me. We don\u2019t see these things normally happening with our seasons.  \u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern where we\u2019re experiencing increasingly extreme weather as the climate changes.\u201d Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, said: \u201cIf we look at the difference in rainfall that\u2019s fallen over the winter compared to spring it is the largest difference in rainfall amount in our national series from 1862. \u201cThe sunshine statistics are really astounding. \u201cThe stand out is by how much sunshine has broken the previous record - set in 1948. There\u2019s been more sunshine than most of our past summer seasons. It's quite remarkable.\"  One of his colleagues described the figures as \"absolutely staggering\". The Met Office says this year is not an indicator of the future, because the jet stream might behave differently. Scientists suspect man-made climate change may be implicated, but it is too soon to tell.   Some of them believe the rapid man-made heating of the Arctic, which has led to record temperatures and wildfires in Siberia, may be influencing the jet stream, although that is not proven. Professor Joe Smith, chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, told BBC News: \"For many people, the recent long sunny spell is simply 'nice weather'.  \"In a wider context it\u2019s a signal of the increasing unpredictability of the UK\u2019s climate. Planning for the growing season is starting to resemble a night at the gambling tables.  \u201cThe fact remains that bold early actions to slash emissions can still cut the larger risks associated with climate change in the UK and around the world\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":"The chancellor has warned Theresa May that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 could cost the UK more than \u00a31tn.  The Financial Times reports that the PM wants to introduce the legislation to Parliament next week as \"one of her most important legacies\".  Philip Hammond has written to her, saying it would mean less money for schools, police and hospitals.  The Committee on Climate Change recommended the target in May .  The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said next week would see the first stage in the process of making this new target law - but any legislation would \"have to wait until after Mrs May and after Brexit, so it could still be some time off\".  Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised his opposite number, saying: \"We are facing a climate emergency and Philip Hammond clearly doesn't get it. \"The Tory party is way overdue in adopting a target already put forward by Labour, and now the chancellor is creating obstacles to prevent the action we desperately need to take.\" A No 10 spokeswoman said there were \"a lot of figures out there on this issue that don't factor in the benefits or consider the costs of not doing this\". She added: \"The costs relating to meeting this target are whole-of-economy costs, not a fiscal cost, and so it's not really right to frame it as a trade-off for public spending.\" The CCC, which is the independent adviser to government on climate change, put the cost at \u00a350bn a year. It said, while the UK would not be able to hit \"net zero\" emissions any sooner, 2050 was still an extremely significant goal.  According to the letter,  seen by the FT , the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy believes it will cost more, estimating \u00a370bn a year.  Mr Hammond said: \"On the basis of these estimates, the total cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy is likely to be well in excess of \u00a31tn.\" The chancellor also warned the move could leave some industries \"economically uncompetitive\" - unless other countries the UK competes with follow suit.  He said it was right for the UK to lead when it came to climate change, but the implications of pursuing the target needed to be \"better understood\".  Analysis by BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith Philip Hammond is not opposed to ambitious energy targets, but it's clear he's worried about the cost - not just the financial cost, but also the potential political cost. And in Mr Hammond's view, there are hard choices to be made. Encouraging consumers to change their habits and household appliances - like boilers - will come at a hefty price in terms of possible subsidies or tax incentives, and that will mean less cash for public services. There could also be a significant additional cost for business, particularly small firms, all of which is likely to prove politically fraught. Of course, Mr Hammond won't be around to feel the political heat when these changes are introduced, but it's clear he thinks his successors at the Treasury need to start doing some serious work on the numbers. Next week will be the first stage in the process when the government announces its intention to press ahead with the net zero target. However, any legislation will have to wait until after Mrs May and after Brexit, so it could still be some time off. Former Energy Secretary, and Liberal Democrat leadership contender, Ed Davey said it was time to act on climate change. \"[Mr] Hammond might be trying to reclaim his crown as a fiscal hawk in the dying embers of [Mrs] May's premiership, but this intervention is wrong-headed and threatens our children's future,\" he said. \"The cost of tackling the climate emergency is massively outweighed by the long term cost of not acting. The chancellor has got his sums wrong.\"  The government's current target is to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.  Mr Hammond said the UK was not on track to reach that goal, so to go further would need an \"ambitious policy response\".   Analysis by BBC science editor David Shukman The tussle over whether Britain should set a carbon target of net zero is being watched closely far beyond these shores.  For months, the government has been campaigning to host what is set to be the most important climate summit for years - a vast event known as COP26, due to be staged in December 2020.  The conference will have the pivotal role of formally putting the Paris Agreement into effect - the world's only international accord designed to limit global warming.  The thinking in Whitehall is that for post-Brexit Britain, hosting this monumental gathering would send a powerful and positive signal, and several Tory leadership candidates have highlighted their support for the move.  But other countries want the prize too, with Italy offering to play host, and Belgium and Turkey throwing their hats into the ring.  The decision is due to be made on 27 June at talks in Bonn, and live coverage around that time of the Conservative leadership process may be seen as a sign of uncertainty in London.  Setting a net-zero carbon target might tip the balance. There's a lot at stake.   The CCC said England can eliminate emissions by 2050, while Scotland could go carbon-free sooner -  by 2045 .  Wales can only  cut 95% of its emissions by 2050  because of its farm industry, and  Northern Ireland will follow England's targets . The BBC's environment analyst, Roger Harrabin, said Scotland had exceptional potential for planting trees (which absorb carbon dioxide) and is more suited for carbon capture and storage. A No 10 spokesman said the government was committed to legislating to net zero and was responsible for commissioning the CCC's report.  He said it \"strongly welcomed the recommendations\" from the committee and it \"remains our intention to make announcement on next steps as soon as we can\".  By BBC Reality Check's Anthony Reuben The Committee on Climate Change puts the cost of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at between 1% and 2% of GDP - the total output of the UK economy - a year. GDP is currently about \u00a32tn a year, so, at the moment, that amount would be between \u00a320bn and \u00a340bn.  Remember, this isn't all government spending - things like transport and power generation could get more expensive, which would increase bills. The CCC reckons the cost will be about \u00a350bn a year in 2050, but will be less in the early years of the transition. Still, you can see how those figures could reach a total of \u00a31tn over 30 years. The letter also refers to a figure of \u00a370bn a year from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy - although the department has declined to comment on whether it has actually come up with that figure. But these figures are only covering the cost - they do not include any possible benefits, creating new jobs in new industries, for example. Although many environment groups are supportive of the move, many campaigners have complained the CCC target is too soft.  The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations, but \"adopt a net-zero target before 2050\". And Extinction Rebellion -  the group which protested in and shut down parts of London in April  - wants the government to hit the net zero target by 2025. Dr Doug Parr, Chief Scientist for Greenpeace UK, said Mr Hammond was putting \"ideology before our wellbeing\". He added: \"If you want to know whether a policy is a good idea, you include the benefits as well as the costs, and in this case the benefits include an economy fit for the 21st century, cleaner air, warmer homes and maximising the chances of civilisation surviving.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis. By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year.  But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says.  The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously. While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot. Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years.  A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there.  Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year.  These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt. As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050. In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat. Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies. Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade.  In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says.  Winter sports also face an uncertain future.  Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050. But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions.  The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end. The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate. Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author.  \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt. \"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said. While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a  UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050 , the majority of sports authorities have not.  The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up.  Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes.  The report was commissioned by the  Rapid Transition Alliance , a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change.  \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group. \"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to protect the landmark Paris agreement, which aims to curb climate change and fossil fuel emissions. He made the promise in a phone call with incoming French President Emmanuel Macron, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. US President Donald Trump is still deciding whether to withdraw from the accord - an election campaign promise. Climate experts worry such a move would throw the agreement into chaos. A White House meeting to discuss the topic on Tuesday has been postponed, amid reports of divisions among senior Trump advisers.  It is the second time the meeting has been cancelled. No new date has been given. The current disagreement within the White House over whether the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a prime example of the much-reported palace intrigue within the Trump administration spilling out into a policy debate. In one corner you have senior officials like strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who are on record calling for an exit from the accord. Others, like Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have been noncommittal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the US should keep a \"seat at the table\" and presidential adviser\/daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are pro-Paris.  Donald Trump,  while he did once tweet that global warming was a Chinese conspiracy , has largely avoided extended discussions on the subject. While his administration is steadily driving to roll back many Obama-era regulations, environmental issues as a whole seem of little interest to him. Any White House meeting to hash out a coherent policy on the Paris agreement is destined to be contentious and with a decidedly uncertain resolution. A battle no-one is convinced they will win is one that is ripe for delay - again. Mr Xi told Mr Macron China and France \"should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement\", according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Under former President Barack Obama, the US and China issued several joint statements on climate change, even announcing together they would sign the Paris agreement. The two countries are the world's biggest polluters. For his part, when Mr Macron received his congratulatory phone call from the US president he told him he would also seek to defend the climate deal. This video can not be played Speaking on Tuesday at a conference in Milan, Italy, Mr Obama said the US and China had to \"lead the way\" in the fight against climate change. \"The good news is the private sector has already made a determination that the future is clean energy,\" he said. \"Those things are locked in now, into the energy sector. Because of the debates taking place in the current administration the steps may be taken more slowly than they would have been done, but I'm confident,\" he added. The latest comments come as climate negotiators meet in the German city of Bonn to discuss how to put the Paris agreement into practice. Almost 200 countries have backed the agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases \"well below\" 2C. It also seeks to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels in an effort to limit floods, droughts and rising sea levels. President Trump has previously said he believes there is no evidence that humans are responsible for climate change. He has called for more drilling, fewer regulations and the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.

{"id":null,"body":"By Duncan Mascarenhas BBC science reporter Increasingly frequent marine heatwaves can lead to the almost instant death of corals, scientists working on the Great Barrier Reef have found.  These episodes of unusually high water temperatures are - like heatwaves on land - associated with climate change.  Scientists studying coral after a heat event discovered that extreme temperature rises decayed reefs much more rapidly than previously thought. They  published their findings in the journal Current Biology. The study revealed that corals became up to 15% weaker after an extreme heat event, causing some fragments to actually break off from the reef.  Dr Tracy Ainsworth, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, worked on the study. She told BBC News that her whole research team, made up of scientists who have worked on corals for more than a decade, was shocked to find them to be \"really brittle\".  More typically, temperature rises cause something called coral bleaching - when the coral expels vital algae that lives in its tissues. In those events, the coral itself remains intact. \"But what we're seeing here is that - when the coral tissue dies - it falls and breaks away from the skeleton,\" Dr Ainsworth explained.  Commenting on the paper, Dr Laura Richardson, from the School of Ocean Sciences at Bangor University, UK, said that the really significant discovery was \"the rapidity with which the reef skeleton breaks down when you have these severe heatwaves\".   Dr Richardson added that the team had documented, for the first time, that severe heatwaves were causing \"almost instant mortality of corals\".  Dr Ainsworth said the researchers referred to the resulting, heat-damaged skeletons as \"ghost corals, because there was just nothing left\".   \"Within about 10 days, those samples that had been exposed to the heatwave... were actually floating.\"  Such damage to a living coral reef affects the entire marine ecosystem, as another member of the research team, Dr Bill Leggat from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, warned. \"The scary thing is - this is a new phenomenon that's being caused by climate change. And the impacts are even more severe than we had thought,\" he told BBC News.  Dr Ainsworth added that this could be \"the canary in the coal mine\" for these ecosystems. She said the findings were a strong warning that \"things are going wrong on some reefs around the world\".   Commenting on the research, Dr James Guest from Newcastle University in the UK, who has been studying coral reef habitats for more than 15 years, said: \"It's hard to know just how much we have to keep saying that this is a big problem before policy-makers decide to do something about it.\"  This video can not be played During the high temperature event the team studied, which occurred on the Great Barrier Reef between 2016 and 2017, there was an estimated loss of a third to half of the corals. \"If you imagine losing 30-50% of the trees in England over the course of two years, it would be quite astounding.\" said Dr Guest.  As well as being vital habitats for marine life, coral reefs are vital to people in coastal communities, who depend on them for fishing, tourism and beach protection. The scientists say urgent action is needed to protect these vulnerable ecosystems from the impact of climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Scientists are learning just how fast the ice margin of Antarctica can retreat in a warming world. They've identified features on the seafloor that indicate the ice edge was reversing at rates of up to 50m a day at the end of the last ice age. That's roughly 10 times faster than what's observed by satellites today. The discovery is important because it puts realistic constraints on the computer simulations that are used to project future change in the region. \"In numerical models, you play with the parameters - and they can do very strange things,\" said Prof Julian Dowdeswell. \"But what these data are saying is that actually rates considerably higher than we get even in the satellite record today were possible in the not-far-distant geological past.\" The director of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge, UK, led an expedition last year to the Larsen region of the Antarctic Peninsula. His team deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with high-resolution mapping capability to examine the sediments at the bottom of the western Weddell Sea. What the robots saw was a delicate pattern of ridges that looked like a series of ladders where each rung was about 1.5m high and spaced roughly 20-25m apart. The scientists interpret these ridges to be features that are generated at the ice grounding zone.  This zone is the point where the ice flowing off Antarctica into the ocean becomes buoyant and starts to float. The rungs are created as the ice at this location repeatedly pats the sediments as the tides rise and fall. For the pattern to have been produced and preserved, the ice must have been in retreat (advancing ice would destroy the ridges). And the tidal \"clock\" therefore gives a rate for this reversal. Prof Dowdeswell explained: \"We have a maximum of 90 of these rungs with a spacing of 20-25m - that gives us, if extrapolated, a rate of 40-50m per day. Again, if extrapolated - that's a rate in excess of 10km per year of retreat. And the really interesting thing about that is it's a rate that's pretty much an order of magnitude higher than even the most rapid retreat of the grounding lines in the Pine Island-Thwaites system today.\" Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are two of Antarctica's fastest-changing ice bodies whose ice margins are being melted by warm ocean water getting underneath them. The ridges seen by the AUVs are some 40km from the cliffs that front the ice edge in the Larsen sector today. The marks are considered to be around 12,000 years old. Back then, the ice sheet would have been far more extensive than it is today, but like today would have been experiencing rapid change as the global climate emerged from the deepest of freezes. Dr Alistair Graham from the University of South Florida, US, works with AUV data. He was not involved in this research. He said he found the interpretation compelling but that there would likely be some scepticism in the community that the rungs really did form daily with the tides. \"The data in the paper are absolutely stunning,\" he told BBC News.   \"The ability to map at a sub-metre resolution from an AUV really lifts a veil on the seafloor structure and composition. We have been able to get snapshots of these sorts of images before, by sending an AUV under Pine Island Glacier, for example, but these imagery from the Dowdeswell team are the best yet from anywhere around Antarctica.  \"What this paper also emphasises to me is that there are still big lessons to learn from looking at the past history of ice sheets at the poles. For somewhere like Thwaites Glacier, where we are desperate to understand its future trajectory, understanding what it did in the centuries and millennia leading up to the observations we are making today will be a critical part of determining how much ice is lost and how fast going forwards.  \"We do have similar high-resolution imagery from an AUV deployed at Thwaites Glacier last year that we are currently working on, and which will hopefully tackle some of these pressing questions.\"  The new research is published  in the journal Science . The  Weddell Sea Expedition 2019  was an international effort led from the SPRI and funded in part by the Flotilla Foundation and Marine Archaeology Consultants Switzerland. The AUVs were operated by the US-UK Ocean Infinity company.

{"id":null,"body":"Former secretary of state Julian Smith has said he hopes NI politicians focus on governing for the people, not on issues around the future of the border. He was speaking during an interview for Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.  Mr Smith was secretary of state for 204 days, helping to restore devolution in January after a three-year impasse. He was replaced by Brandon Lewis just five weeks later, but told Talkback he would continue to help Northern Ireland any way he could. Mr Smith said there were some \"extremely talented\" assembly members in Northern Ireland. \"I think the biggest message and the biggest thing that I hope will happen is that, over and above the constitutional debates, in the back of every politician's mind is that they stood on the sidelines for three years and didn't lead despite being paid and service the interests of the people of Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"I think if all parties focus on governing now - yes have a debate on constitutional issues and obviously there are big topics there - but there's a lot that can be done on the north-south bodies, on climate change, on infrastructure.\" He added: \"I was really struck when we did the Stormont deal, people were literally coming up to me in the street and just thanking me for getting it back up and running. \"That was because, not that they didn't have views on the constitution, but at the moment the focus needs to be on getting stuff done, whether it's education, healthcare, whatever.\" Mr Smith said he was \"delighted and over the moon\" when the parties agreed to return to Stormont and said the importance of devolution had been shown by the way the executive had dealt with the coronavirus pandemic. \"If we'd gone in to either no deal [Brexit] last year without some form of governance or this pandemic without a government we would have had major issues,\" he said. \"So I think the biggest thing is to applaud all those political leaders for getting through that period.\" Mr Smith said the day he was appointed Northern Ireland secretary he'd had \"far too many beers\" after going to the pub when he lost his job as Conservative chief whip, but that he was honoured to take the job. He said getting the executive back up and running was the first priority. \"Those early weeks were frustrating because the political parties were really not engaging and there was ebbing and flowing between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP in their levels of enthusiasm,\" he said. Mr Smith said he was not bitter about being replaced as secretary of state and he continued to have an interest in Northern Ireland. \"I'm really committed long-term to doing anything that's needed to assist a part of the UK that has been through the most horrendous times, that when I was a child was on the television every night,\" he said. \"I was then given this opportunity to help as secretary of state and I will continue to help in the best way I can. \"What potential it has, the young people, the hope for the future - the need is to really focus on what matters and that is about people, understanding people, trusting people, working with people.\" The full interview is available via BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on  BBC Sounds.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, BBC News This video can not be played The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting in Sweden to thresh out a critical report on global warming. Scientists will underline, with greater certainty than ever, the role of human activities in rising temperatures. But many governments are demanding a clearer explanation of the  slowdown in temperature increases  since 1998. One participant told BBC News that this pause will be a \"central piece\" of the summary. Researchers from all over the world  work with the IPCC  to pore over thousands of peer-reviewed studies and produce a summary representing the current state of climate science.  Its previous report in 2007 was instrumental in helping the panel  share the Nobel Peace Prize  that year. A new Summary for Policymakers on the physical sciences, the first of three parts that make up a report to be released over the next 12 months, will be published in Stockholm on Friday. It will focus on the science underlying changes in temperature in the atmosphere, the oceans and at the poles.   New estimates will be given for the scale of global warming and its impact on sea levels, glaciers and ice sheets.   In  its last report in 2007 , the IPCC stated that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal\" and that \"most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th Century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations\" - in other words, humans burning fossil fuels.  In the latest draft summary, seen by the BBC, the level of scientific certainty has increased.  The panel states that it is 95% certain that the \"human influence on climate caused more than half the observed increase in global average surface temperatures from 1951-2010.\" But since 2007, there has been a growing focus on the fact that global average temperatures haven't gone above the level recorded in 1998.  This slowdown, or hiatus as the IPCC refers to it, has been leapt upon by climate sceptics to argue that the scientific belief that emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere increases the temperature of the planet, is wrong.  Scientists have attempted to explain the pause in a number of ways, with many arguing that the Earth has continued to warm but that the heat has gone into oceans.   The  most recent report suggested that a periodic cooling of the Pacific ocean  was counteracting the impact of the extra carbon in the atmosphere.  But there is  no certainty and little agreement among scientists  on the mechanisms involved.  And this week, when the scientists will go through their summary line by line with officials from 195 governments, the pause is likely to be the focus of heated debate.  Prof Arthur Petersen is the chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and part of the Dutch delegation that will review the IPCC report.  \"Governments are demanding a clear explanation of what are the possible causes of this factor,\" he told BBC News. \"I expect that this will be a central piece of the summary.\" There are likely to be tough negotiations between the parties throughout the week, with governments having already submitted around 1,800 comments on the draft.   Any changes to the text will need to be approved by the scientists, who will want to make sure that they are consistent with the underlying reports. This could lead to some tense moments.  \"I wouldn't say there is a reluctance of the authors to take up such an issue as the pause, but they want to do it in a proper way,\" said Prof Petersen. \"There will remain a tension between how much you can deliver based on the peer-reviewed science and what the governments would like to have.\"  In the draft report, the panel agrees that \"the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998-2012) is smaller than the trend since 1951\".  The effect of this slowdown means that the future temperature range predicted by the IPCC will be wider than in 2007, and with a lower starting point.  Many  sceptical voices believe  this is a recognition that the IPCC modelling process has been too sensitive to carbon dioxide, a claim given some credence by the text of the draft which states that some models have \"too strong a response to increasing greenhouse gas forcing\". But Prof Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is a vice-chair of the IPCC, rejects this idea.  \"To take that out of context, if that change is confirmed this week, and to present it as a big change in the opinion the IPCC has on climate sensitivity, is ridiculous,\" he said. \"Most climate scientists wouldn't say that the 15-year period is a good reason to question the overall quality of models.\" There is a feeling among many scientists involved with the process that this report will be more complicated and cautious than in 2007.  In the wake of that year's report, a small number of  embarrassing errors were detected  in the underlying material. The organisation's reputation was also questioned in the  Climategate  rumpus. \"Overall, the message is, in that sense more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones,\" said Prof Petersen. \"The language has become more complicated to understand, but it is more precise.  \"It is a major feat that we have been able to produce such a document which is such an adequate assessment of the science. That being said, it is virtually unreadable!\" Follow Matt on  Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Scientists have responded furiously to claims about climate change made in a live BBC radio interview. Experts told BBC News that the assertions made by former Chancellor Nigel Lawson on Radio 4's Today programme were simply untrue.  Lord Lawson had claimed that global temperatures had \"slightly declined\" over the past 10 years.  However, scientists working in the field said the records showed the complete opposite to be the case. BBC Radio 4's Today programme defended its decision to interview Lord Lawson on Thursday morning in a segment on climate change. The BBC argued that it had a duty to inform listeners about all sides of a debate. This video can not be played During the interview, Lord Lawson said that \"official figures\" showed that \"during this past 10 years, if anything... average world temperature has slightly declined\". But  speaking in a follow-up discussion on Friday morning , Dr Peter Stott from the UK Met Office said the former Chancellor had got the facts wrong. \"We know that 2016 was the warmest on record, over a degree warmer than late 19th Century levels, so this claim that we heard from Nigel Lawson that there's been cooling is simply not true,\" he told the BBC. His view was echoed by Prof Richard Betts from the University of Exeter.  \"The official figures do not show that the global mean temperature 'has slightly declined'. In fact, they show the opposite - global mean temperature has increased during the past 10 years,\" he said in a statement.    \"The last three years were warmer than the previous seven, and indeed were the warmest on record, and this year is also shaping up to be nearly as warm (probably not quite as warm as last year since the influence of the El Nino has passed, but still a very warm year).\"  On Thursday, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its  2016 State of the Climate  report, stating that the year was the warmest in 137 years of record keeping.  All over the planet, the peer reviewed study found strong evidence of ongoing warming linked to human activities.  Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit new highs, as did global sea levels, while at both poles the extent of sea-ice hit new lows.  Lord Lawson, who was energy secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government before becoming chancellor, now chairs the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think-tank that describes itself as \"open-minded on the contested science of global warming\". He was taking part in a segment following  an interview with former US Vice President Al Gore , who was promoting the sequel to his hit documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which made the case for tackling climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. On the programme, Mr Gore made the economic case for renewable energy and said that \"climate-related extreme weather events have grown far more numerous and far more destructive\" in the 10 years since the first film. It was suggested to the former Democratic presidential contender that he was going further than the scientific consensus but he said researchers around the world were \"virtually unanimous on this and have been for decades\", adding that \"record downpours\" in the UK were a result of climate change. Lord Lawson was asked why he thought Mr Gore was, in his words, \"talking complete nonsense\". The former cabinet minister said that \"all the experts say there hasn't been\" an increase in extreme weather events, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But speaking on Friday morning, Dr Stott said Lord Lawson was wrong about the IPCC as well.  The panel had clearly indicated that there had been an increase in extreme events and that these increases were linked to human use of fossil fuels.  \"If you take the global picture, the IPCC said very clearly that it is very likely that human influence has contributed to observed global-scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes,\" he told the Today programme.   \"If you take the global picture and look at the global fingerprint - yes, you can attribute that.\"  Many scientists took to Twitter to express their dismay at the airing of what they say were false claims.  Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox said it was \"irresponsible and highly misleading to give the impression that there is a meaningful debate about the science\". Fellow physicist and broadcaster Jim al-Khalili tweeted: \"For @BBCr4today to bring on Lord Lawson 'in the name of balance' on climate change is both ignorant and irresponsible. Shame on you.\" He added: \"There should be NO debate anymore about climate change. We (the world minus Trump\/Lawson et al) have moved on.\" In a statement, the BBC said: \"The BBC's role is to hear different views so listeners are informed about all sides of debate and we are required to ensure controversial subjects are treated with due impartiality.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By David Brown BBC News Farmers are on the front line of climate change - vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as increasingly frequent extreme weather events. They also  face criticism , in particular over greenhouse gas emissions from the meat and dairy industry, with calls for a move to a more plant-based diet. Agriculture is currently responsible for about 9% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from methane.   The National Farmers' Union (NFU), which represents 55,000 UK farmers, has set a target of net-zero emissions in British farming by 2040. That is not enough for some environmentalists, who say a comprehensive overhaul of farming practices and a move to less intensive production is long overdue.  But some new and surprising changes are happening on the UK's farms. Scientists in Wiltshire are part of a growing group of experts around the world developing small battery-powered robots that could drastically cut tractor use. Tractors use diesel, a major source of carbon emissions in farming. \"Using robots cuts the energy used in cultivation by about 90%,\" says Sarra Mander of the Salisbury-based Small Robot Company.   The machines rely on artificial intelligence to sow seeds, identify individual weeds, and apply exactly the right amounts of pesticide and fertiliser in the right places, rather than spraying it across a whole field.  \"If you had a few weeds in your garden, you wouldn't spray the whole garden, you'd just spray the area with the problem. That's what we do. It's all about precision,\" adds Sarra.   Sowing is done by placing individual seeds in the ground, without ploughing. Less soil disturbance means more carbon stays locked in the soil.  Robots are still relatively unusual in UK arable farming but machines are being developed all over the world to handle everything from mapping to planting, pruning and picking.   The investment bank Goldman Sachs is among those  predicting a huge global shift  to technology-driven \"precision farming\" in the coming years.  Drones and tractor-mounted sensors are also being used to help farmers work out the exact patterns of moisture, weeds and pests. The data is fed to precision machinery to target areas that need work - and leave the rest undisturbed. Nitrogen fertiliser takes a lot of energy to produce and, particularly if it is applied at the wrong time and in the wrong quantities, bacteria act on it to make nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is 200 to 300 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Mapping and analysing each field enables farmers to target nitrogen fertiliser in only those places where it is needed, at the right time - and cut their emissions. \"This kind of innovation is fantastic for us,\" says Becky Willson, of the  Farm Carbon Cutting Toolkit  organisation.  \"It's not a total answer but it can really help.\" Like Becky, many environmental campaigners also believe applying new technology without fundamental change to intensive farming practices is not enough.  Nick Rau, of Friends of the Earth, says: \"New technology is helpful - but simple, low-tech solutions, looking at whole farms over a number of seasons have been grossly neglected.\" Nick believes there's huge potential in a range of solutions and points, in particular, to tree planting. Friends of the Earth is calling for a doubling of tree cover - to boost carbon storage, help with flooding and prevent soil erosion.  Cambridgeshire farmer Stephen Briggs agrees. \"It's about taking lessons from nature,\" he says.  He now grows 13 different varieties of apples over 125 acres (0.5 sq km), about 8% of his farm.   The apple trees stop soil erosion, lock carbon into the ground, support biodiversity and deliver a new crop.  His profitability, Stephen says, has improved since he made the change, 10 years ago.  \"By growing trees alongside wheat, you expand the productive space up into the air and down into the soil,  plus you extend the period of the year that you're capturing the sunshine,\" he says. Wind protection from trees can also reduce the time livestock need to be kept indoors in the winter, again saving on energy and cutting emissions.  Farmers who keep their animals outdoors for longer in the UK can help to cut emissions thousands of miles away.  When animals are taken indoors, they are sometimes fed on soya imported from Latin America.   Soya is often cultivated on land that was previously rainforest, so the demand for animal feed in the UK is, critics say, exporting deforestation. British cows are fed on grass for more of the year than cows in many other countries, so the UK's impact on deforestation through soy imports may be relatively small.  But soya production for the global animal feed industry is one of the most important drivers of deforestation, according to the  Global Forest Atlas , and the Amazon has been cleared at an alarming rate.   It's estimated that since 1970 about 20% of the Amazon has been lost.   The environmental group  Greenpeace  has also highlighted the huge areas of rainforest lost to soya cultivation.  And Richard Finlay, of the NFU, says British farmers understand their part in fighting climate change does not end at UK shores.  \"A large proportion of the supply chain has already committed to solely using sustainable, responsibly sourced soya,\" he says.  Cows and sheep produce methane in their digestive systems. Methane produces 21 times as much warming in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Whilst carbon dioxide is the biggest concern for many other industries, in farming methane is a major worry.  The NFU points to many farmers using methane from manures and slurries to generate electricity and says the British livestock industry is one of the most efficient and sustainable in the world.  But the methane problem has generated a whole range of other approaches.  \"There's a lot of thinking about feed additives which might reduce methane production in the animals' guts,\" Becky Willson says. Some researchers and organisations, such as Becky's, are also pointing to better breeding and genetics as a way forward. For beef cattle, one  approach in Scotland  has been to select animals for breeding on the basis of how much methane they produce in their digestive systems.  For dairy cattle, which start producing milk at the age of two, an  approach in the US  has been aimed at lengthening the animals' productive lifespan - so the proportion of the animals' life that is unproductive and spent consuming energy and emitting methane is reduced.   Put simply, breeding cows which produce milk for longer, reduces the need for dairy calf replacements - which will consume energy and emit methane, without producing milk, for the first two years of their lives. For lambs, with a typical lifespan of about six to eight months, the goal has been to produce animals that fatten more quickly and can be slaughtered earlier.  Research in Wales  pointed to reductions of about six days in the time taken to fatten hill lambs, though some  farmers report  reductions of up to 30 days. It is, quite literally, a matter of life and death.  Produced by David Brown and Mark Bryson. Read more on the BBC's  Focus on Farming here .

{"id":null,"body":"By Bethany Bell BBC News, Vienna Austria, with its sensitive Alpine regions, has been particularly hard hit by climate change, a major survey says. The Austrian Climate Change Assessment Report 2014  says average temperatures in Austria have risen by almost 2C since 1880. This is compared with a global rise of 0.85C in the same period. The document says that the changes in temperature are mainly man-made and caused by \"emissions of greenhouse gases\". The report was put together by more than 200 scientists and presented in Vienna by Austrian Environment Minister Andrae Rupprechter. One of the scientists behind the document, Helga Kromp-Kolb from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, told Austria's ORF TV that the above-average increases in temperature were due to Austria's landlocked position and its sensitive Alpine regions. \"We are a continental area, which gives us a higher rise in temperature and\u2026 we are in a mountain region where the decrease in snow cover intensifies the warming process\", she said. The report says that in the last 130 years, sunshine in the Alps has increased by approximately 20%.  It says that snow cover, particularly at mid-altitude elevations, has declined, and that there has been a clear reduction in the surface of Austria's glaciers. Rises in temperature, it says, have accelerated since 1980. \"Cold nights have become rarer, but hot days have become more common.\" The report warns that \"without increased efforts to adapt to climate change, Austria's vulnerability will increase\", particularly in areas such as agriculture, forestry and winter tourism. \"Compared with destinations where natural snow is plentiful, many Austrian ski areas are threatened by the increasing costs of snowmaking.\" It warns that if nothing is done, temperatures could rise by 3.5% by 2100. Non-governmental organisations in Austria have called for rapid action to be taken. The \"report shows that Austria is heavily affected by climate change and the damage will continue to increase if decisive action is not taken,\" environmental organisations Global 2000, Greenpeace and WWF said in a joint press release.

{"id":null,"body":"Sir Ed Davey has been elected leader of the Liberal Democrats, beating fellow MP Layla Moran to the top job. He has served as energy and climate change secretary, received an award for a life-saving act of heroism, almost became a spy - and Ed Balls used to copy his homework. But how did the economist rise to be head of the Liberal Democrats and can he turn round the fortunes of his ailing party? Born in Nottinghamshire, to solicitor John and teacher Nina, Sir Ed has described his childhood as happy and stable. However, he was only four when his father died and still in his teens when his mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. The task of caring for their sick mother largely fell to the young Ed and his elder brother. She died when he was 15. Speaking to the Nick Robinson Political Thinking podcast,  he said that losing both parents at a young age made him \"quite independent\". \"I remember after my mum died that summer going back to our house by myself and thinking about studying - previously I had studied to make my mum happy, now I had to make that decision for myself,\" he said.  The young Ed attended Nottingham High School, which he described as a \"public school with a lot of Tory bias but also a lot of free thinking and people reading the Guardian\". The Lib Dem leader is not the first politician among the school's alumni. Conservative minister Ken Clarke also attended the school as well as Labour ministers Geoff Hoon and Ed Balls.  \"I lent him my O-level history notes,\" said Sir Ed of the Strictly Come Dancing star, adding: \"He never gave them back.\" Although interested in ideas as a teenager, he didn't commit to a political party. His elder brother Charles took him to his first political event - a Young Conservatives disco - which he says \"put me off for life\". Having been heavily influenced by Johnathon Porritt's book on the ecology of politics Seeing Green, Sir Ed looked at joining the Green Party but concluded they were \"too authoritarian and left wing\". Six months after graduating from Oxford University with a first class degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, he went to work as economics researcher to the Liberal Democrats, led at the time by Paddy Ashdown.  However his career could have taken a very different path. At around the same time MI6 tried to recruit him. Asked by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire why he turned it down, he replied that \"working for Paddy was pretty exciting - you never knew what you he was going to do next\". Despite rejecting the chance to be the next James Bond, he was still capable of heroic acts. In 1994 he received awards from the Royal Humane Society and the British Transport Police after rescuing a woman from the path of an oncoming train at Clapham Junction. Acting as an economic adviser, he continued working for the Liberal Democrats until 1993, when he left to join consultancy firm Omega Partners. However he soon returned to Parliament after winning the then Conservative seat of Kingston and Surbiton in the 1997 election. As a Liberal Democrat he may not have imagined he would one day end up in a position of power, but when Nick Clegg took his party into coalition with David Cameron's Conservatives he became a junior minister in the business department. And in 2012 he replaced Chris Huhne as energy and environment secretary.  Mr Huhne had resigned  after being charged with perverting the course of justice over a speeding case. Recalling his time in government, Sir Ed said there was \"an amazing sense that the things you had dreamed of, you could actually implement... it was so exciting\". He also admitted to feeling frustration and said he learnt to develop \"sharp elbows\". In a list of his \"proudest\" achievements at the energy department, Sir Ed includes increasing the UK's use of renewable electricity, securing EU-wide climate change targets and making switching suppliers easier. His time in government didn't last and in the 2015 election he, along with 48 other Liberal Democrat MPs, lost his seat as voters gave the party a pummelling. But two years later he returned to Parliament, retaking his Kingston and Surbiton seat. Following that election, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron resigned and Sir Ed considered running to replace him. However he chose not to, citing his family as the reason. He had married fellow Lib Dem Emily Gasson in 2005 and the pair had two young children, a daughter Ellie and a son John who could neither walk nor talk due to an undiagnosed neurological condition. The Lib Dem leader describes his son as \"adorable\" and \"great fun\" but acknowledges that caring for him is \"extraordinarily challenging\". \"It certainly shaped my views and helped me understand disability a lot more,\" he has said.  Two years on, he felt able to enter the leadership contest - this time to replace outgoing leader Sir Vince Cable. He lost that race to Jo Swinson, but six months later she was out and he took the reins as acting co-leader of the party. During his leadership campaign Sir Ed has said the party needs to move away from campaigning on Brexit,  telling the Guardian:  \"People need to understand what a party is about. And you can't define a party by an issue which will go, which is transitional.\" Seeking to replace Brexit as the party's key theme, he has sought to focus on support for carers and investment in the green economy. But with low poll ratings, and few MPs, the new leader faces an uphill struggle in his bid to get the public to care about the Liberal Democrats' core messages. In his acceptance speech,  he said he would rebuild the party, adding: \"We have to wake up and smell the coffee.\"  He said the party had lost touch at a national level and must \"face the facts\" of poor results at three successive general elections.  \"It is time for us to start listening,\" he said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tom Espiner Business reporter, BBC News Human life \"as we know it\" could be threatened by climate change, economists at JP Morgan have warned. In a hard-hitting report to clients, the economists said that without action being taken there could be \"catastrophic outcomes\". The bank said the research came from a team that was \"wholly independent from the company as a whole\". Climate campaigners have previously criticised JP Morgan for its investments in fossil fuels. The firm's stark report was sent to clients and seen by BBC News. While JP Morgan economists have warned about unpredictability in climate change before, the language used in the new report was very forceful. \"We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened,\" JP Morgan economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray said. Carbon emissions in the coming decades \"will continue to affect the climate for centuries to come in a way that is likely to be irreversible,\" they said, adding that climate change action should be motivated \"by the likelihood of extreme events\". Climate change could affect economic growth, shares, health, and how long people live, they said. It could put stresses on water, cause famine, and cause people to be displaced or migrate. Climate change could also cause political stress, conflict, and it could hit biodiversity and species survival, the report warned.  To mitigate climate change net carbon emissions need to be cut to zero by 2050. To do this, there needed to be a global tax on carbon, the report authors said. But they said that \"this is not going to happen anytime soon\". Developed countries were worried that cutting emissions would affect competitiveness and jobs, while less developed countries \"see carbon intensive activity as a way of raising living standards.\" \"It is a global problem but no global solution is in sight,\" the report added. The bank has warned about climate change before, although not in such strong and sweeping terms as its economists. In March 2019 Bloomberg reported that an executive had warned that the US needed to significantly cut its carbon footprint, and in May of that year  iJP Morgan called climate change a \"global challenge\" that presents risks for business. Large organisations such as JP Morgan face a challenge in that inaction on climate change could have a huge hit on revenues - but so could taking action. JP Morgan itself has been strongly criticised in the past for heavy investment in fossil fuels. The Rainforest Action Network released  a 2019 report  claiming that the US banking giant provided the most fossil fuel firm financing of any bank in from 2016 to 2018. Rupert Read, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of East Anglia, and a spokesperson for campaign group Extinction Rebellion, said that the bank is \"taken by some to be the largest fossil fuel funder in the world.\" He said if the bank's own researchers were \"saying the very future of the human race is at stake\" then the bank itself should change its direction. \"It's good they [the researchers] are telling the truth more - it's not good they [the bank] remain a strong funder of fossil fuels,\" he said. \"Everyone has to have responsibility for change, whether they are asset managers, or institutional investors, or chief executives, or shareholders,\" he added. A JP Morgan spokesperson said the research team's view was \"wholly independent from the company as a whole, and not a commentary on it\" and declined to comment further. Mark Cutifani, chief executive of mining giant Anglo American, told the BBC how the firm wants to reduce its carbon footprint, and ''can see a pathway to creating carbon neutral mines''.  Talking about a timeframe he added: \"We are a bit concerned about putting a date on it as yet because some of the technologies are still evolving. We will get there, the only question is how quickly we can get there.''  Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift Can big investors save the world?

{"id":null,"body":"The highest court in the Netherlands has upheld a ruling requiring the government to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% of 1990 levels by the end of next year. The case was brought six years ago by the Urgenda environment group in a bid to force ministers to go well beyond EU targets. However, the chances of the government reaching the target look slim. By the end of 2018, emissions were down only 15% on 1990 levels. Dutch environment researchers believe that levels could be cut by 23% by the end of 2020 but believe the reduction could be as low as 19%. The government in The Hague presented its climate accord at the end of June, with plans for a 49% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and phasing out coal-fired power generation starting in 2020. This video can not be played While there have been cuts in methane and nitrous oxide as well as other gases, levels of carbon dioxide emissions have changed little in the Netherlands since 1990. Last month, under pressure to act over a nitrogen oxide pollution crisis, Dutch ministers announced a cut in the daytime speed limit to 100km\/h (62mph). The Council of State forced the government to act in that case, by declaring that rules for granting building and farming permits were in breach of EU law protecting nature. In its decision on Friday, the  Supreme Court said it had based its ruling (in Dutch) on the UN climate convention  and the state's legal obligation to protect the lives and well-being of Dutch citizens. \"There is a great deal of consensus in the scientific and international community over the urgent need for a reduction in greenhouse gases by at least 25% by developed countries,\" the court said. While the EU target for a cut in carbon emissions is 20% of 1990 levels, Urgenda took up the case on behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, arguing that their government had a legal duty to prevent climate change and should seek a bigger reduction. They first won their case in June 2015 but it was challenged by the government all the way to the Supreme Court. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Dutch forced to cut speed limit to lower emissions Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Environmentalists are using the law to pressure the government to force infrastructure plans into line with its climate change commitments. Ministers are facing a fusillade of legal challenges on airports, energy and roads. And now they have been threatened with new legal action unless their airports strategy reflects the drive towards a zero-emissions economy. A separate legal challenge to the government's road building strategy from campaign group Transport Action Network is already under way. Earlier this week, campaigners won a battle to force ministers to review their energy policy statement so it reflects climate concerns. The new action against the airports strategy comes from a not-for-profit group, the Good Law Project.  It is undaunted by this week's Supreme Court defeat, when judges said the 2018 document didn't break the law because at the time the UK was aiming for a 80% emissions cut by 2050. Good Law accepts the Supreme Court ruling - but insists that the UK airports strategy must now be aligned with the Climate Change Act, which is now in force and which demands almost zero emissions by 2050. The aviation strategy was agreed in the light of fears that airport capacity in south-east England was becoming over-loaded.  Good Law says the strategy should be reviewed because of the likely long-term dampening effect on business travel from the Covid pandemic - that's as well as the carbon impacts of the runway. A government spokesperson said it had always been clear that Heathrow expansion is a private sector project which must meet strict criteria on air quality, noise and climate change. \"We take our commitments on the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions seriously,\" they added.  \"The government is planning to consult next year on an aviation decarbonisation strategy, which will set out proposals for how the aviation sector will play its part in delivering our net zero commitments.\" But Good Law's hopes for an immediate aviation review are based on a near-identical action it started in March to  force the government  to revise its Energy National Policy Statement in the light of net zero commitments.  At first, Business and Energy Secretary Alok Sharma refused to comply, but earlier this week he capitulated. Good Law expects the government to follow suit by revising the airports strategy shortly, too - especially as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously voiced opposition to Heathrow expansion and is reputed to be looking for an easy way to stop it. A spokesperson for Good Law said: \"Boris Johnson won't need to 'lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction of that third runway\" (as he  promised previously ).  \"He'll merely need to ensure that the proposed development of Heathrow is considered under the legal regime that prevails today. It's not too late to stop Heathrow expansion.\" Another group, Plan B, plans to challenge every stage of the Heathrow affair in the courts - including at the European Court of Human Rights, where campaigners will argue that relying on outdated emissions targets is inconsistent with the right to life. The advisory Climate Change Committee recommends that building a third runway at Heathrow without shrinking airport capacity elsewhere would breach UK emissions targets. The action against the road-building strategy is being taken by the Transport Action Network. It challenges the government's 2014 National Networks National Policy Statement, which underpins its \u00a327bn roads programme.  Campaigners argue that this, too, will breach climate targets.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A \"triple whammy\" of events threatens to hamper efforts to tackle climate change say UN delegates. At a meeting in Bonn, Saudi Arabia has continued to object to a key IPCC scientific report that urges drastic cuts in carbon emissions.  Added to that, the EU has so far failed to agree to a long term net zero emissions target. Thirdly, a draft text from the G20 summit in Japan later this week waters down commitments to tackle warming.  One attendee in Bonn said that, taken together, the moves represented a fierce backlash from countries with strong fossil fuel interests. There was  controversy last December at the Katowice COP24 meeting in Poland , when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia objected to moves to welcome the findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5C. That study,  regarded as a landmark , had two clear messages.  It showed that there were huge benefits in keeping temperature rises this century to 1.5C compared to a world that warmed 2C or more.   It also said that keeping the world below 1.5C was still possible, if drastic cuts in emissions were initiated by 2030. To the frustration of a huge majority of countries, the objections of the four major fossil fuel producers, meant that the scientific report was not formally recognised in the negotiations.  The battle over the 1.5C report has carried over from Katowice to Bonn. Normally, this mid-year meeting is concerned with technical questions but this time the issue of the IPCC has re-emerged as a huge fault line between nations.  The Saudis are keen to highlight what are termed \"knowledge gaps\" in the IPCC report, that they believe hamper its ability to inform decision making at national or international level.  \"We know that there are some hardliners that would try to downplay the seriousness and the actions that are required, that is their point of view,\" said Carlos Fuller from Belize, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.   \"They recognise that they need to undertake major changes that they are not happy about.\"  This video can not be played Many environmental campaigners see the Saudi pressure on the IPCC as part of campaign to discredit the science.  \"The report shows the importance of striving towards 1.5C, that it is still achievable, and there is an incredible urgency to act vigorously and quickly,\" said Dr Jeni Miller from the Global Climate and Health Alliance.  \"This report was requested by the UN, by these countries themselves, so to not accept the findings of the report is a rejection of science, and if you are rejecting the science there is not a way forward to address this problem.\" While delegates seek to find a way forward on the science, there is growing concern about the  European Union's inability to reach consensus on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 .  Despite the late support of Germany in favour of the idea, four countries including Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Estonia, refused to support the plan last week. This has caused some dismay among officials at the UN.  The Secretary General,  Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called  a special summit on climate change to be held in New York in September  with the express purpose of getting countries to increase their existing targets.  The EU's proposed net zero goal was key to making this a success. Mr Guterres has expressed his \"personal concern\" about the setback. Campaigners are also worried.  \"The EU are very aware of the Secretary General's summit, they are aware they are calling for a revision of targets, it would be embarrassing for the EU to go with what they just have now,\" said Ulriikka Aarnio, from the Climate Action Network. \"Somebody said they would be going from leader to loser if that was the case.\" Do you have a question you want to ask about the planet?

A draft of the closing communiqu\u00e9 mentions climate change as just one issue among many and omits to use the phrases \"global warming\" and \"decarbonisation\". Critics believe that Japan is trying hard to win favour with the US on trade issues by downplaying the scale of the climate question and possible solutions to it.  \"The story, based on a draft of the communiqu\u00e9, shows Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a weak host and his G20 climate promises are full of hot air, undermining his previous claims that he seeks to save the planet.\" said Kimiko Hirata, director of the Kiko Network Japan, a non-governmental organisation. \"Japan, alongside China, is the biggest financier of coal overseas in the world and the government continues to build new coal plants domestically despite our huge solar and wind power potential.\" As well as Japan, other leading economies are continuing to support coal based power generation. A  study released by the Overseas Development Institute  says that G20 nations have almost tripled the subsidies given to coal fired plants in recent years, despite the growing need to cut emissions.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent It's the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity, and emissions have risen rapidly in recent years, the BBC has learned.  Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, is widely used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits and accidents.  But leaks of the little-known gas in the UK and the rest of the EU in 2017 were the equivalent of putting an extra 1.3 million cars on the road.  Levels are rising as an unintended consequence of the green energy boom. Cheap and non-flammable, SF6 is a colourless, odourless, synthetic gas. It makes a hugely effective insulating material for medium and high-voltage electrical installations.  It is widely used across the industry, from large power stations to wind turbines to electrical sub-stations in towns and cities. It prevents electrical accidents and fires. This video can not be played However, the significant downside to using the gas is that it has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. It is 23,500 times more warming than carbon dioxide (CO2).  Just one kilogram of SF6 warms the Earth to the same extent as 24 people flying London to New York return.   It also persists in the atmosphere for a long time, warming the Earth for at least 1,000 years. The way we make electricity around the world is changing rapidly. Where once large coal-fired power stations brought energy to millions, the drive to combat climate change means they are now being replaced by mixed sources of power including wind, solar and gas.  This has resulted in many more connections to the electricity grid, and a rise in the number of electrical switches and circuit breakers that are needed to prevent serious accidents. Collectively, these safety devices are called switchgear. The vast majority use SF6 gas to quench arcs and stop short circuits. \"As renewable projects are getting bigger and bigger, we have had to use it within wind turbines specifically,\" said Costa Pirgousis, an engineer with Scottish Power Renewables on its new East Anglia wind farm, which doesn't use SF6 in turbines. \"As we are putting in more and more turbines, we need more and more switchgear and, as a result, more SF6 is being introduced into big turbines off shore. \"It's been proven for years and we know how it works, and as a result it is very reliable and very low maintenance for us offshore.\" Across the entire UK network of power lines and substations, there are around one million kilograms of SF6 installed.  A  study from the University of Cardiff  found that across all transmission and distribution networks, the amount used was increasing by 30-40 tonnes per year.   This rise was also reflected across Europe with total emissions from the 28 member states in 2017 equivalent to 6.73 million tonnes of CO2. That's the same as the emissions from 1.3 million extra cars on the road for a year. Researchers at the University of Bristol who monitor concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere say they have seen significant rises in the last 20 years.  \"We make measurements of SF6 in the background atmosphere,\" said Dr Matt Rigby, reader in atmospheric chemistry at Bristol. \"What we've seen is that the levels have increased substantially, and we've seen almost a doubling of the atmospheric concentration in the last two decades.\" The most important means by which SF6 gets into the atmosphere is from leaks in the electricity industry. Electrical company Eaton, which manufactures switchgear without SF6, says its research indicates that for the full life-cycle of the product, leaks could be as high as 15% - much higher than many other estimates. Louis Shaffer, electrical business manager at Eaton, said: \"The newer gear has very low leak rates but the key question is do you have newer gear? \"We looked at all equipment and looked at the average of all those leak rates, and we didn't see people taking into account the filling of the gas. Plus, we looked at how you recycle it and return it and also included the catastrophic leaks.\"  Concentrations in the atmosphere are very small right now, just a fraction of the amount of CO2 in the air.  However, the global installed base of SF6 is expected to grow by 75% by 2030.  Another concern is that SF6 is a synthetic gas and isn't absorbed or destroyed naturally. It will all have to be replaced and destroyed to limit the impact on the climate.  Developed countries are expected to report every year to the UN on how much SF6 they use, but developing countries do not face any restrictions on use.  Right now, scientists are detecting concentrations in the atmosphere that are 10 times the amount declared by countries in their reports. Scientists say this is not all coming from countries like India, China and South Korea.  One  study found  that the methods used to calculate emissions in richer countries \"severely under-reported\" emissions over the past two decades.  SF6 comes under a group of human-produced substances known as F-gases. The European Commission tried to prohibit a number of these environmentally harmful substances, including gases in refrigeration and air conditioning, back in 2014.  But they faced strong opposition from industries across Europe.  This video can not be played \"In the end, the electrical industry lobby was too strong and we had to give in to them,\" said Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout, who was responsible for the attempt to regulate F-gases.  \"The electric sector was very strong in arguing that if you want an energy transition, and you have to shift more to electricity, you will need more electric devices. And then you also will need more SF6.  \"They used the argument that otherwise the energy transition would be slowed down.\" Everyone is trying to reduce their dependence on the gas, as it is universally recognised as harmful to the climate.  In the UK, energy regulator Ofgem says it is working with utilities to try to limit leaks of the gas. \"We are using a range of tools to make sure that companies limit their use of SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, where this is in the interest of energy consumers,\" an Ofgem spokesperson told BBC News.  \"This includes funding innovation trials and rewarding companies to research and find alternatives, setting emissions targets, rewarding companies that beat those targets, and penalising those that miss them.\"  The question of alternatives to SF6 has been contentious over recent years.  For high-voltage applications, experts say there are very few solutions that have been rigorously tested.  \"There is no real alternative that is proven,\" said Prof Manu Haddad from the school of engineering at Cardiff University. \"There are some that are being proposed now but to prove their operation over a long period of time is a risk that many companies don't want to take.\"  However, for medium voltage operations there are several tried-and-tested materials. Some in the industry say that the conservative nature of the electrical industry is the key reason that few want to change to a less harmful alternative.  \"I will tell you, everyone in this industry knows you can do this; there is not a technical reason not to do it,\" said Louis Shaffer from Eaton. \"It's not really economic; it's more a question that change takes effort and if you don't have to, you won't do it.\" Sitting in the North Sea some 43km from the Suffolk coast, Scottish Power Renewables has installed one of world's biggest wind farms where the turbines will be free of SF6 gas. East Anglia One will see 102 of these towering generators erected, with the capacity to produce up to 714MW (megawatts) of power by 2020, enough to supply half a million homes.  Previously, an installation like this would have used switchgear supplied with SF6, to prevent the electrical accidents that can lead to fires.  Each turbine would normally have contained around 5kg of SF6, which, if it leaked into the atmosphere, would add the equivalent of around 117 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is roughly the same as the annual emissions from 25 cars. \"In this case we are using a combination of clean air and vacuum technology within the turbine. It allows us to still have a very efficient, reliable, high-voltage network but to also be environmentally friendly,\" said Costa Pirgousis from Scottish Power Renewables. \"Once there are viable alternatives on the market, there is no reason not to use them. In this case, we've got a viable alternative and that's why we are using it.\" But even for companies that are trying to limit the use of SF6, there are still limitations. At the heart of East Anglia One sits a giant offshore substation to which all 102 turbines will connect. It still uses significant quantities of the highly warming gas. The EU will review the use of SF6 next year and will examine whether alternatives are available. However, even the most optimistic experts don't think that any ban is likely to be put in place before 2025.  Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathBBC .

{"id":null,"body":"Ever since US President Donald Trump declared that he would withdraw the US from the landmark Paris climate change agreement, much has been made of the fact only two other countries have not signed up. They are Syria, and the Central American nation of Nicaragua - but the US is very different from either. Syria has been embroiled in a civil war for six years, leaving 300,000 dead, so it is perhaps understandable that it did not participate in talks.  Nicaragua's reason for refusing the deal, though, is not because it wanted to burn more fossil fuels, but because the agreement did not go far enough. The country already gets more than half of its energy from renewable resources, and plans to bump that up to 90% by 2020. A 2013 World Bank report  labelled it \"a renewable energy paradise\", with extensive opportunity for geothermic, wind, solar and wave energy. When the Paris deal was being negotiated, Nicaragua said there was a total mismatch between what the document said was needed to protect the climate, and what signatories proposed to do about it. This video can not be played The goal of the Paris agreement is to restrict temperature increases by 2100 to a maximum of two degrees Celsius more than before the global industrial age - and aim for 1.5C if possible. But Paul Oquist, negotiating for Nicaragua in 2015, said he had reservations about the level of commitment made by individual countries in their pledges. They would not restrict average temperature rises to 2C, let alone 1.5C, he said - and much more action is required. \"These voluntary commitments don't work,\" Mr Oquist  told Democracy Now after the negotiations . \"Right now we're looking at a three-degree world, and that is catastrophic and unacceptable.\" That is in sharp contrast to Donald Trump's speech announcing he was pulling out of the agreement - in which he said the Paris agreement was a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US, to the benefit of other nations. Not so, Mr Oquist argued at the Paris summit - developing nations are being held equally accountable for climate change - something he argued was unfair. Historically, the US, Europe, and more recently China account for almost half of the world's carbon emissions. The US outputs some 5.2 million kilotons of carbon dioxide every year. Nicaragua, by contrast, generated about 4,569. Rest of world rallies around climate deal Does Trump still think it's all a hoax?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Tackling climate change must be woven into the solution to the Covid-19 economic crisis, the UK will tell governments next week. Environment ministers from 30 countries are meeting in a two-day online conference in a bid to make progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  The gathering is called the \"Petersberg Climate Dialogue\". It will focus on how to organise a \"green\" economic recovery after the acute phase of the pandemic is over. The other aim is to forge international agreement on ambitious carbon cuts despite the postponement of the key conference COP26 - previously scheduled for Glasgow in November (now without a date).  Alok Sharma, the UK Climate Secretary and president of COP26, said: \"I am committed to increasing global climate ambition so that we deliver on the Paris Agreement (to stabilise temperature rise well below 2C).  \"The world must work together, as it has to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, to support a green and resilient recovery, which leaves no one behind.  \"At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, we will come together to discuss how we can turn ambition into real action.\" The informal conference is co-hosted by the UK and Germany.  Developed and developing countries will attend, along with the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and members of civil society and business.  Last week, Mr Guterres warned that climate change was  a deeper problem than the virus . Campaign groups will be sceptical about the meeting. Since the Paris deal to cut emissions, CO2 has actually been rising - although there's currently a blip in the trend thanks to the Covid recession. The development charity CARE says it's alarmed that public finance provided from rich countries to developing countries to adapt to inevitable climate change actually decreased in 2018.  Sven Harmeling from CARE said: \"If governments fail to make their economic stimulus sustainable and equitable, they will drive our planet much deeper into the existential economic, social and ecological turmoil caused by the climate crisis.\" The EU is already set on delivering a green stimulus. The Commission's Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, said every euro spent on economic recovery measures after the COVID-19 crisis would be linked to the green and digital transitions. \"The European Green Deal is a growth strategy and a winning strategy,\" he tweeted. \"It's not a luxury we drop when we hit another crisis. It is essential for Europe's future. Meanwhile, China appears set on its current carbon-intensive development path, and President Trump says the US will rescue struggling fossil fuel firms. Even in Europe there's a degree of push-back against the idea of a green stimulus . Markus Pieper, an MEP from the centre-right German CDU party, told the magazine FOCUS that the EU's sweeping plan for investment in clean technologies would no longer be possible.  He said: \"The Green Deal was a gigantic challenge for an economy in top shape. After the corona bloodletting, it is simply not financially viable.\" But the UK climate economist Lord Stern told BBC News: \"The immediate priority is the current Covid crisis \u2013 but then we have to build for the future. \"Timmermans is right and Trump is wrong. We should only be bailing out firms that are going to contribute to tackling climate change. \"They don\u2019t have be be ostensibly clean tech firms at the moment \u2013 but they do have to be committed to cutting their emissions in line with international targets.\" The high-level segment on 28 April can be followed live from around 3:10 pm  here .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Critical elements in the Earth\u2019s climate may be more likely to break down than previously thought, according to a group of scientists. Their  commentary in the journal Nature  says there\u2019s growing evidence that irreversible climatic changes could be triggered within a few decades. The authors claim this could lead to a \u201cclimatic emergency\u201d in which one shift amplifies another. But other researchers say the argument is speculative. The authors specialise in what\u2019s known as Earth Systems Science, which studies the interactions of elements of the climate system. For several years they have been promoting the theory that the climate may switch suddenly as a result of one climatic shift amplifying other changes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced this idea of \"tipping points\" two decades ago.  The commentary says that at the time these large-scale shifts were considered likely only if global warming exceeded 5C.  The authors argue that information from IPCC reports over the past two years suggests that tipping points could be exceeded even between 1 and 2C of warming.  They say research has shown that the Amundsen Sea bay of West Antarctica might already have passed a tipping point where the meeting point of ice, ocean and bedrock is retreating irreversibly.  One computer model suggests that when this sector collapses, it could destabilise the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet like toppling dominoes - leading to about three metres of sea-level rise on a timescale of centuries to millennia. The authors also point to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  As the elevation of the ice sheet lowers, it melts further, exposing the surface to ever-warmer air in what's known as a \"positive feedback\". Some models suggest that the Greenland ice sheet could be doomed to disappear relentlessly if the world warms by just 1.5C. The commentary says: \u201cPoliticians, economists and even some natural scientists have tended to assume that tipping points in the Earth system such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest or the West Antarctic ice sheet, are of low probability and little understood. \u201cYet evidence is mounting that these events could be more likely than was thought, have high impacts and are interconnected across different biophysical systems, potentially committing the world to long-term irreversible changes.\u201d Co-author Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, says it is not only human pressures on Earth that continue rising to unprecedented levels.  \u201cIt is also that as science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming,\" he says. \"This is what we now start seeing, already at 1C global warming.  \u201cThis provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency to unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.\u201d But not every scientist agrees with the thrust of their argument. One critic is Professor Mike Hulme from Cambridge University, who is disturbed by the talk of planetary emergency.  \u201cTheir position is speculative; there are no new research findings presented here. \u201cTheir mathematical \u2018formula\u2019 contradicts everything that social science and humanities scholarship tells us about public emergencies - namely that they result from political argument, reflection and judgement. \u201cEmergencies are declared by legitimate political actors; they are not calculated mathematically by self-appointed scientists.\u201d Professor Richard Betts from the Met Office says the chances of passing these tipping points increases with the level of global heating.  \"Therefore, if we want to keep the risks to a minimum, it is logical that global heating should also be kept to a minimum. \"Even if we do pass a 'point of no return' (or if we have done so already - which may or may not be the case) we still have a chance to limit the damage if we don't overshoot too far.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin.

{"id":null,"body":"It's been four years since Donald Trump made a string of promises during his long 2016 campaign to be the 45th president of the United States. Four years later, his supporters often cite \"promises made, promises kept\" as a reason why they're backing him again.  Many of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a border wall paid for by Mexico. But others went a little under the radar, like his pledge to eliminate the national debt. So how has he done in keeping his promises? Before election:  Trump promised to lower the corporate tax rate and bring in huge tax cuts for working Americans. After:  The Republican tax plan passed in December 2017, and it largely ticks the box for the president although its merits are hotly disputed. He has had to compromise on his pledge to bring corporation tax down from 35% to 15% (it will be 21% instead).  And the tax cuts for individuals will expire, although Republicans say future governments will simply renew them. But wealthy Americans are expected to benefit more than poorer ones.  Not everyone saw their taxes lowered. For some higher earners in urbanised, mostly\u00a0Democratic\u00a0states, taxes went up due to a cap on state and local property and income tax deductions. Before:  As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth.  After:  After three months of hemming and hawing behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, is unequivocally a promise kept. The exit officially takes effect 4 November, the day after the US election.  Before:  \"I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.\" After:  He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has appointed two - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  Mr Gorsuch's appointment required a procedural change to Senate rules, but it was Mr Kavanaugh's appointment that was particularly controversial. Mr Kavanaugh faced sexual assault allegations - which he denied - and was eventually voted through by 50-48 - the tightest nomination vote since 1881. What's more, his third nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is on course to be confirmed. If approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, she could ensure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades to come. In addition to making his mark on the top court, Mr Trump has appointed nearly 200 conservative judges to lower federal courts. Before:  One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered. It is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a \"job killer\" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals. After:  Republicans have been unable to pass a repeal or reform bill. That said, the Trump administration has managed to dismantle parts of the law - enrolment periods have been shortened, some subsidies have been axed, and the fine for people who did not purchase health insurance has been eliminated as part of the 2017 tax plan. And in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that repealing this penalty, an \"essential\" part of the law, meant the entirety of Obamacare is therefore unconstitutional. The law, however, remains in place as an appeal heads to the US Supreme Court, with a ruling expected sometime in 2021.  This video can not be played Before:  His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it. After:  Mexico poured scorn on the claim that it would pay for such a barrier, and even Mr Trump appears to have dropped that idea. Democrats are vociferously opposed to a wall, whereas some Republicans have baulked at a bill that could reach $21.5bn (\u00a317bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report. In December 2018 the US government went into shutdown after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn to fund the wall. He has since redirected defence and some other funds to build or replace sections of the wall, a decision that has faced legal challenges.  As of late May, 194 miles of wall system had been built, mostly to shore up dilapidated or outdated designs of the barrier already in place - just three miles construction was part of an entirely new system.  This video can not be played Before:  During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb the so-called Islamic State group into obliteration. After:  The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan. He also takes credit for driving IS out of parts of Iraq and Syria, saying the group has been \"largely defeated\", although that process was under way under Obama. Last year, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos. This video can not be played Before:  Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim. After:  In 2017, he said he formally recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and approved moving the US embassy. It opened in May 2018 to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary. The construction of a permanent US embassy building in Jerusalem was approved in 2019. Before:  \"I'm going to build a military that's going to be much stronger than it is right now. It's going to be so strong, nobody's going to mess with us,\" Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in October 2015. He promised to reverse defence cuts brought in by President Barack Obama in 2013. \"We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance,\" he said. After:  Defence spending has indeed risen steadily throughout the Trump presidency - although overall levels remain below the first years of the Obama administration.  Military spending increased dramatically from 2002 as the US entered protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It peaked in 2010 as a percentage of GDP - the value of all goods and services - after which the US began stepping back from its engagement in the Middle East and Central Asia.  Before:  Just a month before his election win in November 2016, Mr Trump said he could cut as many as 70% of US federal regulations if elected.  \"It's just stopping businesses from growing,\"  he told an audience in New Hampshire .  The promise drew him support from large and small businesses, who helped him to victory that year.  After:  The president has slashed through regulations on everything from labour to the environment. Just days after taking office he signed the Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which mandated that when government departments asked for a federal regulation, they had to specify two others they would drop.  Throughout his term he has continued to slash back red tape. In January 2020 he scrapped protections for US wetlands and streams, and in July he announced changes to the National Environmental Protection Act in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects.  \"We are reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation that gets things done,\" he said.  Before:  Mr Trump has long called for the US to leave the Middle East. On the 2016 campaign trail, he said the region was a \"total and complete mess\" and wished the government had spent the trillions of dollars in the US instead. His talk of an end to US military deployments overseas predates his presidential run. In 2013, he tweeted: \"Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.\" That same year, he said the US should \"stay the hell out\" of the Syrian war.  After:  In September 2017, the Trump administration announced the deployment of 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Mr Trump said his approach would be based on conditions on the ground. In Syria, the US had led a coalition against IS along with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, with around 2,000 troops on the ground. By December 2018, Mr Trump ordered the withdrawal of all US troops from Syria, though about half the troops, approximately 500, still remain.  Mr Trump recently said he has plans to further cut troops in Afghanistan - after reducing them to 8,600 from 13,000 over the spring and summer  - before the 3 November election. In February, US and Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops from the country within 14 months if Taliban militants uphold a new peace agreement. The president's efforts to pull down troops has at times been met with criticism from his own officials. Following Mr Trump's announcement of a Syria withdrawal  in part prompted the resignation of US Defence Secretary James Mattis .  Before:  Mr Trump called Nafta \"a disaster\" and warned that the TPP \"is going to be worse, so we will stop it\". He also pledged to correct the trade deficit with China. After:  Mr Trump followed through in his first few days on his pledge to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He later said he would consider re-joining the TPP if he got a better deal. On 30 November, after protracted negotiations, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was designed to replace Nafta and recently came into force. However, the US has reimposed aluminium tariffs on Canada, and Ottawa reciprocated with retaliatory tariffs.  The US and South Korea also signed a revised trade pact in September 2018.  The US and China, meanwhile, became embroiled in an escalating trade battle - with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.  Despite ongoing tensions, in August the US and China held talks over their  so-called \"phase-one\" trade deal - signed early this year  - that is aimed at easing the trade war.  Before:  Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a \"total and complete\" shutdown should remain until the US authorities \"can figure out what's going on\". But he switched to \"extreme vetting\" after he became the party's presidential candidate.  After:  As president, he introduced two travel bans which became ensnarled in the courts - but the third had more luck. The US Supreme Court ruled President Trump's ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges. The current ban restricts travellers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea. And in January, the US has announced it was expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries. Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas. Before:  Mr Trump said in September 2016 that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama had struck to reopen diplomatic relations and improve trade. After:  As president, he told an audience in Miami that he was \"cancelling the Obama administration's one-sided deal.\"  In 2017, Mr Trump reimposed some trade and travel restrictions lifted by his predecessor. He kept the embassy open in Havana, although without naming an ambassador to the country. Last year, the administration announced a ban on travel to Cuba for American group tours as well as cruise ships journeying to the island Until then, US tourism to Cuba was not permitted, but certain forms of organised group travel, known as \"people-to-people\" travel, had been allowed. This month the US administration announced further restrictions, saying it would suspend all private charter flights between the United States and Cuba, to increase economic pressure on Havana. The suspension comes into force on 13 October. Before:  Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a \"currency manipulator\" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of \"raping\" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods. After:  In August 2019, the administration officially named China as a \"currency manipulator\". The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when countries deliberately influence the exchange rate between their currency and the US dollar to gain \"unfair competitive advantage in international trade\". But in January, the US reversed its decision when China had agreed to refrain from devaluing its currency to make its own goods cheaper for foreign buyers. Before:  \"I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them,\"  Donald Trump told the Washington Post  in 2016, and promised to clear the country's then-$19tn national debt \"over a period of eight years\". After:  Halfway through that eight-year promise, the US national debt has ballooned by more than a third, hitting $27tn in October 2020. Mr Trump increased the national debt ceiling in 2017, before suspending it until after the 2020 election in July 2019.  It is predicted the debt will rise even further once the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic becomes apparent. Before:  Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are estimated to be more than 11.3 million - \"have to go\". After:  As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who \"are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers\".  In fiscal year 2019 deportations were at 267,000, a slight rise on the year before, though not as high as the 2012 peak of 410,000 under the Obama administration.  Mr Trump's plans for immigration reform faced defeat this summer when the Supreme Court ruled against his administration's bid to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), which protects about 650,000 young people who entered the US without documents as children. Before:  The country's infrastructure \"will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it\", he said in his victory speech in November. After:  Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but as yet, there is little sign of action. By March 2018 Congress had allocated $21bn for infrastructure spending - far short of the $1.5tn Mr Trump has called for.  The money will be spent on a wide range of upgrades and investments , according to a congressional graphic. In April 2019, Mr Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2tn on infrastructure, an agreement that later fell apart. This June there were reports the Trump administration had a $1tn plan in the works, but no announcement has been made.  Before:  Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it \"obsolete\". One issue that irked him was whether members were pulling their weight and \"paying their bills\". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia. After:  But as he hosted Nato's secretary general at the White House in April 2018, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. \"I said it [Nato] was obsolete,\" Mr Trump said. \"It's no longer obsolete.\" In July 2018, Mr Trump reiterated his support at the Nato summit, but suggested the US might still leave if allies did not acquiesce to his budget demands.  Mr Trump has continued to argue that Canada and European members of Nato  are not spending enough to support the alliance, and recently said the US will move nearly 12,000 troops out of Germany.  Before:  Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding \"immediately\" and \"make it also much worse\", adding \"torture works\". After:  But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the countervailing belief, espoused by former Defence Secretary James Mattis and then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state. Mr Pompeo said during his CIA confirmation hearing that he would \"absolutely not\" reinstate such methods.  Before:  \"Lock her up\" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters. They wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state. And Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\" After:  The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was \"such a nasty woman\" as someone the country owed \"a debt of gratitude\". Later, he said he \"hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought\" and had other priorities. In November 2016 Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton \"heal\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent China's aggressive policy of planting trees is likely playing a significant role in tempering its climate impacts. An international team has identified two areas in the country where the scale of carbon dioxide absorption by new forests has been underestimated. Taken together, these areas account for a little over 35% of China's entire land carbon \"sink\", the group says. The researchers' analysis, based on ground and satellite observations, is  reported in Nature journal .  A carbon sink is any reservoir - such as peatlands, or forests - that absorbs more carbon than it releases, thereby lowering the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. China is the world's biggest source of human-produced carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. But it recently stated an intention to peak those emissions before 2030 and then to move to carbon neutrality by 2060. The specifics of how the country would reach these goals is not clear, but it inevitably has to include not only deep cuts in fossil fuel use but ways also to pull carbon out of the atmosphere.  \"Achieving China's net-zero target by 2060, recently announced by the Chinese President Xi Jinping, will involve a massive change in energy production and also the growth of sustainable land carbon sinks,\" said co-author Prof Yi Liu at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.  \"The afforestation activities described in [our Nature] paper will play a role in achieving that target,\" he told BBC News. China's increasing leafiness has been evident for some time. Billions of trees have been planted in recent decades, to tackle desertification and soil loss, and to establish vibrant timber and paper industries. The new study refines estimates for how much CO2 all these extra trees could be taking up as they grow.  The latest analysis examined a host of data sources. These comprised forestry records, satellite remote-sensing measurements of vegetation greenness, soil water availability; and observations of CO2, again made from space but also from direct sampling of the air at ground level.   \"China is one of the major global emitters of CO2 but how much is absorbed by its forests is very uncertain,\" said the IAP scientist Jing Wang, the report's lead author.  \"Working with CO2 data collected by the Chinese Meteorological Administration we have been able to locate and quantify how much CO2 is absorbed by Chinese forests.\" The two previously under-appreciated carbon sink areas are centred on China's southwest, in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces; and its northeast, particularly Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. The land biosphere over southwest China, by far the largest single region of uptake, represents a sink of about -0.35 petagrams per year, representing 31.5% of the Chinese land carbon sink. A petagram is a billion tonnes. The land biosphere over northeast China, the researchers say, is seasonal, so it takes up carbon during the growing season but emits carbon otherwise. Its net annual balance is roughly -0.05 petagrams per year, representing about 4.5% of the Chinese land carbon sink. To put these numbers in context, the group adds, China was emitting 2.67 petagrams of carbon as a consequence of fossil fuel use in 2017. Prof Paul Palmer, a co-author from Edinburgh University, UK, said the size of the forest sinks might surprise people but pointed to the very good agreement between space and in situ measurements as reason to have confidence in the analysis.  \"Bold scientific statements must be supported by massive amounts of evidence and this is what we have done in this study,\" the  NERC National Centre of Earth Observation scientist told BBC News.  \"We have collected together a range of ground-based and satellite data-driven evidence to form a consistent and robust narrative about the Chinese carbon cycle.\" Prof Shaun Quegan from Sheffield University, UK, studies Earth's carbon balance but was not involved in this research. He said the extent of the northeast sink was not a surprise to him, but the southwest one was. But he cautioned that new forests' ability to draw down carbon declines with time as the growth rate declines and the systems move towards a more steady state. \"This paper clearly illustrates how multiple sources of evidence from space data can increase our confidence in carbon flux estimates based on sparse ground data,\" he said.  \"This augurs well for the use of the new generation of space sensors to aid nations' efforts to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.\" Prof Quegan is the lead scientist on  Europe's upcoming Biomass mission , a radar spacecraft that will essentially weigh forests from orbit. It will be able to tell where exactly the carbon is being stored, be it in tree trunks, in the soil or somewhere else. Another future satellite project of note in this context is the planned  EU Sentinel mission (currently codenamed CO2M)  to measure CO2 in the atmosphere at very high resolution.  Richard Black is director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a non-profit think-tank working on climate change and energy issues. He commented: \"With China setting out its ambition for net zero, it's obviously crucial to know the size of the national carbon sink, so this is an important study. \"However, although the forest sink is bigger than thought, no-one should mistake this as constituting a 'free pass' way to reach net zero. For one thing, carbon absorption will be needed to compensate for ongoing emissions of all greenhouse gases, not just CO2; for another, the carbon balance of China's forests may be compromised by climate change impacts, as we're seeing now in places such as California, Australia and Russia.\" Follow Jonathan  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Pupils from around the UK went \"on strike\" on Friday as part of a global campaign for action on climate change. Students around the country walked out of schools to call on the government to declare a climate emergency and take active steps to tackle the problem.  Organisers Youth Strike 4 Climate said protests took place in more than 60 towns and cities, with an estimated 15,000 taking part.  They carried placards, some reading: \"There is no planet B.\"  The action was part of a much wider global movement, known as Schools 4 Climate Action. It  began with 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg  skipping class to sit outside government buildings in September, accusing her country of not following the Paris Climate Agreement.  Since then, tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia have been inspired to hold their own demonstrations.  The biggest protests were held in London, Brighton, Oxford and Exeter, the UK Student Climate Network said.  The group, which helped coordinate the protests, has  four key demands :  Greta tweeted about the UK protests, writing: \"British PM says that the children on school strike are 'wasting lesson time'. That may well be the case.  \"But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. And that is slightly worse.\"   A Downing Street spokeswoman said that, while it was important for young people to engage with issues like climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils.  The National Association of Head Teachers  said it did not condone children missing school to take part in the action and that \"nothing is more important than a child's education\".  It said \"individual school leaders can decide how best to respond\" to any protests involving its students. However, energy minister Claire Perry said she was \"incredibly proud\" of young people's passion and concern. She told the BBC: \"I suspect if this was happening 40 years ago, I would be out there too.\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said schoolchildren were \"right to feel let down by the generation before them\", while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it was the \"most hopeful thing that's happened in years\".  Climate change is the greatest threat that we all face but it is the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line. They are right to feel let down by the generation before them and it\u2019s inspiring to see them making their voice heard today.  #SchoolStrike4Climate Feeling quite emotional! Incredible turnout in  #Brighton  for  #climatestrike . This is most hopeful thing that's happened in years. Exciting thing is positive policies like  #GreenNewDeal  are taking off too. We can win this fight for a safer, fairer future! #schoolstrike4climate   pic.twitter.com\/TA8edUjSC7 She addressed campaigners in Brighton, saying they should be allowed to miss school because of \"exceptional circumstances\".  She said: \"The time for talking is over, and time for action is now.\"  In London, 15-year-old Christina said the issue was too big to ignore.  \"A lot of us are very good, obedient students but when it comes to climate change, it's really important,\" she said.  \"The youth of our time tend to get pushed to one side. We often stay quiet but when it comes to climate change we are going to have to pay for the older generation's mistakes.\"  Scarlet, 15, from Suffolk, is part of the UK Student Climate Network. She said: \"We want the UK government to declare a climate emergency and make moves to achieve climate justice, prioritising this above all else.  \"We're demanding the government listen to us and we will continue to make a noise until they do so.  \"It can't be about behaviour change any more; it has to be about system change.\"  By BBC education reporter Judith Burns Teenagers brandishing brightly-coloured posters packed Parliament Square chanting \"save our planet\".  Many were keen to point out it is their generation who will be left to pick up the pieces of our civilisation's waste and pollution.  They don't feel the government is listening to scientists' warnings on climate change. Without a vote, protests like this one are their only option, they say. Some climbed onto statues but were quickly ordered down by police. The organisers had planned a revision session to show the protestors take their education seriously but instead, shortly after noon, some of the teenagers, sat down on a crossing, blocking traffic.  Again they moved on quickly, but took an unplanned walk up Whitehall. Most of the protesters left the square and marched to Downing Street.  The protest is good-humoured, but the organisers' plans have been abandoned.   By about 13:30 only a noisy hardcore of a few hundred demonstrators remained, determined to cause maximum disruption to traffic outside the Palace of Westminster.  Small groups staged sit-down protests across junctions, surrounding buses, shouting \"engines off\" at drivers and climbing traffic lights. As police dispersed one group another would form. I saw one young man arrested for obstruction - but he said he was not a school student.  Hundreds of young protesters chanted for climate justice in Cambridge. One of them was 10-year-old Zachary, who attended with his mother.   He said: \"People just have to change their ways as we don't want the world as it is right now. \"We just want to make people aware of it. We were talking about it in our class, so we just came along.\" A protest was held in Belfast , where students walked out of schools to attend a demonstration at the City Hall.  In Wales, hundreds of primary and secondary school pupils  descended on the Welsh Assembly  in Cardiff Bay. Meanwhile in the Scottish Highlands,  pupils staged hour-long walkouts  outside their school gates.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed youngsters taking part, saying it was a \"cause for optimism in an often dark world\". It\u2019s a cause for optimism, in an often dark world, that young people are taking a stand on climate change.  @scotgov  is a world leader but, given the urgency, it is right that we are all challenged to do more and that we hear the voice of the next generation.  https:\/\/t.co\/NJOMuN649Q Scotland Yard said two arrests were made in London. A 19-year-old man was arrested for obstructing a highway while a 17-year-old was arrested for a public order offence. Another nationwide protest has been planned for 15 March.

{"id":null,"body":"Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions in the UK is achievable with current technology, according to a new report. The  Centre for Alternative Technology  (CAT) said a net zero-carbon Britain is already possible, without relying on future developments. The Powys-based charity said changes to buildings, transport and industry could help slash UK energy demand by 60%.  \"We have the technology to combat climate change and we can start today,\" said project coordinator Paul Allen. The CAT report -  Zero Carbon Britain: Rising to the Climate Emergency  - also claims making further changes to energy, diets and land use could help provide 100% renewable energy and cut emissions from agriculture and industry. That would mean the UK would not be reliant on \"as yet unproven\" technologies, such as carbon or air capture, said Machynlleth-based CAT. Mr Allen said using alternatives to technology that is ready to be rolled out at scale was \"not worth the risk\". However, the UK government described carbon capture as a \"game-changing technology\" in addressing climate change and said  the country's first project should be operational next year . Britain was the first major nation to propose cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero,  promising to do so by 2050 . Reducing energy use CAT said more new houses should be built to high Passivhaus standards that can  reduce energy costs to just \u00a315 a year  by using insulated masonry and concrete, triple-glazing, LED lighting and air-source heat pumps. Some of these changes could also be fitted to existing buildings to improve temperature control and potentially reduce heating use by around 50%. Transport energy demand could also be cut by 78% by increased use of public transport, walking, cycling and using electric vehicles while  cutting flights by two-thirds . Increasing energy supplies Based on the past decade's weather and energy use, it is possible to fully match the UK's entire energy demand with renewable and carbon-neutral energy, the report claims, if CAT's recommendations are carried out. Half of that would be provided by wind while other sources suited to the UK climate - including geothermal, hydro, tidal and solar - would produce most of the rest. Carbon-neutral synthetic fuels  are also an important alternative to electricity, especially in some areas of industry and transport. Transforming land and diets Switching  from meat and dairy to plant-based proteins , reducing food waste and improving agriculture could go a long way to cutting carbon emissions, the report said. CAT says the UK can: \"We can still have coffee, chocolate and tea in a zero-carbon Britain, but the UK currently imports many foods that we can easily grow here,\" said Mr Allen. \"By changing what we eat and how it's grown, and by wasting less food, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase resilience and improve health and wellbeing.\" CAT is urging politicians to come up with action plans with policy frameworks and large-scale investment as a matter of urgency. This video can not be played Recent polling said the environment was one of the top priorities for voters at this year's general election. As well as the 2050 pledge, the  Conservatives announced a halt to fracking , the controversial process of extracting gas from shale rock. Labour derided the halt as a pause rather than a total ban. Labour followed that with a  warm homes plan  to insulate the country's nearly 27 million households and help with solar panels and heat pumps. The Tories dismissed the scheme's \u00a3250bn bill as unaffordable and unrealistic. The Liberal Democrats have  pledged a \u00a3100bn climate fund  over five years to be funded through borrowing and tax changes. The Green Party has gone further, promising  \u00a3100bn, every year  to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a  \u00a320bn \"green jobs revolution\"  in Wales including three tidal lagoons, a barrage and a new offshore wind farm.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News, Washington DC The population of wild reindeer, or caribou, in the Arctic has crashed by more than half in the last two decades.  A new report on the impact of climate change in the Arctic revealed that numbers fell from almost 5 million to around 2.1 million animals.  The report was released at the American Geophysical Research Union meeting.   It revealed how weather patterns and vegetation changes are making the Arctic tundra a much less hospitable place for reindeer. Reindeer and caribou are the same species, but the vast, wild herds in northern Canada and Alaska are referred to as caribou.  It is these herds that are faring the worst, according to scientists monitoring their numbers. Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - \"such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight\", this  Arctic Report Card  stated.   There are multiple reasons.  Prof Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating. \"We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation.\" The lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. \"Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,\" he told BBC News.  Another very big issue is the number of insects. \"Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,\" said Prof Epstein. \"It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou.  \"If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects.\" Rain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food.  At the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase.  But scientists say we have opened the door on the \"world's freezer\" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate.  The report, compiled by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in \"uncharted territory\".  \"In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,\" she said. \"And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world.\"     Some other key points from the report included:  Also here at AGU, scientists have revealed that  East Antarctica's glaciers have begun to \"wake up\"  and show a response to warming. This is evidence of unprecedented climate-driven change at the top and bottom of the planet.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent It may sound like the title of a low budget sci-fi movie, but for planetary scientists, \"Hothouse Earth\" is a deadly serious concept. Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come. Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this \"irreversible pathway\".  Their  study shows  it could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies.  Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse.   So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. \"What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,\" co-author Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News.  \"We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium.\" Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade.  In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term \"feedback processes\". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor.  The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes.  In short, it's not good.  According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years.   The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable.  The impacts would be \"massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,\" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought.  \"One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,\" said Prof Rockstr\u00f6m. \"It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought.\" What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems.  People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century.  But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an \"irreversible pathway\" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Surprisingly, yes!  We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet.   \"Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions.  \"This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,\" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound.  \"As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',\" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. \"Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for \u2012 thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth.\" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. \"Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,\" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. \"At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The biggest and most damaging hurricanes are now three times more frequent than they were 100 years ago, say researchers. Using a new method of calculating the destruction, the scientists say the increase in frequency is \"unequivocal\". Previous attempts to isolate the impact of climate change on hurricanes have often came up with conflicting results. But the new study says the increase in damage caused by these big cyclones is linked by global warming. Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was estimated to be $125bn, roughly 1% of US GDP. This video can not be played One of the big questions that scientists have wrestled with is how to compare storm events from different eras. Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier? Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency. However this new paper challenges that view.  Instead of looking at economic damage, the authors looked at the amount of land that was totally destroyed by more than 240 storms between 1900 and 2018, based on insurance industry databases.  As an example, the researchers examined Hurricane Irma that hit Florida in 2017.  Around 1.1 million people were living inside the 10,000 sq km closest to the storm's landfall.  With the wealth per capita estimated to be $194,000, the scientists concluded that the overall wealth in this 10,000 sq km region was $215bn.  As the storm caused $50bn worth of damage, this was 23% of the wealth in the region. Taking 23% of the 10,000 sq km gave an area of total destruction of 2,300 sq km.  By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons in terms of damage over the decades.  The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century. And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures. \"Our data reveal an emergent positive trend in damage which we attribute to a detectable change in extreme storms due to global warming,\" they write.   This video can not be played The scientists involved believe their new method is solid and gives a more accurate picture of what is happening with the worst storms. \"The new method of looking at the frequencies is really robust,\" said Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the study. \"The increase in frequency is not only in my own dataset but is also present in other datasets, so it is extremely robust, and I think that will help it become more accepted.\"  The  study has been published  in the journal PNAS.

{"id":null,"body":"By Kris Bramwell BBC News Users of the social video app TikTok have been spreading a message of climate change awareness through make-up and time-lapse videos. Their chosen hashtag of #Globalwarning - a play on the term \"global warming\" - has been viewed more than 24 million times on the app so far. Short-form videos created by popular TikTokers show the possible effects of global warming on the human body and the Earth.  Many of the featured videos show healthy flowers dying and the effects of people overheating and choking on plastic. \"It's a very current issue,\" says 21-year-old  Anna Bogomolova, from Russia, who created one of these videos  before the hashtag became official.    \"People need to be aware of the problem for things to change. We've got to take action. Our lives depend on it.\"  Anna's video, one of several on TikTok, has been liked more than 2.3 million times. However, reaction to her vision of the future has been mixed.  \"Some people were saying they weren't going to be alive in 100 years so we shouldn't worry. Others have been scared by the horrors in the video and the future it depicts,\" she says. One user called Tigerlover7749 writes \"we're going to regret not listening\", while PS1 Hagrid says the video made them worry about their grandchildren's futures.    At one stage in her video, Anna leaps to the year 3000 and coughs up some plastic while choking.  She says she does this to show \"the long-term impact of global warming\" and the \"bigger consequences\" that could occur in the future. \"Other generations started this problem but we can't say we won't be alive to see the consequences. We have to do something and change things, otherwise the planet will just die,\" she adds.  Anna, currently studying fine art in London, believes there are things individuals can do to help slow down global warming and minimise pollution, such as using public transport and shopping responsibly.  \"Small changes can go a long way and it's up to us to keep the planet alive,\" she says.

The 31-year-old, from Andover in Hampshire, uses the top half of her body to show a green and pleasant landscape by the sea.  This is then transformed by the emergence of a power station, a number of tower blocks, roads and litter. The trees have lost their leaves or have been cut down and the grass has died.  Hannah says she \"pulled an all nighter\" and worked for 10 hours to complete the body art. She was motivated to become involved in #globalwarning because of the increased attention given to the amount of plastic being used across the world.  \"At the moment we're seeing a lot on television about plastics in the sea, and there's a huge emphasis on reducing plastic in everything we do,\" she says.    Plastic played a huge part in Hana Martin's design too.  The 16-year-old, from South Wales, says she saw videos on TikTok representing the effects of global warming in the distant future and wanted to show the damage being done to the world.  She created  a make-up design depicting an ocean full of life,  before this is replaced by a sea of rubbish, plastic and toxic waste. There is even a dolphin caught up in a net and a turtle trapped in plastic.   \"I wanted to show a drastic change,\" she says.   Hana has been creating make-up designs in her spare time for the last month, and hopes her video \"shocks people\" but also educates and inspires. In response to it, one user called Dede comments \"this just teaches us [that] it's not always about us, we need to think of the animals. Don't litter, take shorter showers - we need to save our beautiful world\". Many others have responded by saying that people need to help to save the Earth.  This video can not be played Hana believes young people are becoming more aware of social issues because of people like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, and in response are becoming activists themselves.  \"Younger people will listen to other younger people,\" she says.  \"My friend told me off the other day for using a plastic bottle.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Molloy Technology reporter Are you the type of person who always says thank you? Well, if it's by email, you should stop, according to UK officials looking at ways to save the environment. The Financial Times reports that we may all soon be encouraged to send one fewer email a day, cutting out \"useless\" one-line messages - such as \"thanks\".  Doing so \"would save a lot of carbon\", one official involved in next year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow said. But would it really make a huge difference? Most people tend to think of the internet as a cloud that exists outside their computing hardware. But the reality is when you send an email - or anything else - it goes along a chain of energy-burning electronics. Your wi-fi router sends the signal along wires to the local exchange - the green box on the street corner - and from there to a telecoms company, and from there to huge data centres operated by the tech giants. Each of those runs on electricity, and it all adds up. But a single email's effect on such massive infrastructure is tiny.  The Financial Times report says the officials  promoting this idea referred to a press release from renewable electricity firm Ovo Energy from one year ago.  It claimed that if every British person sent one fewer thank you email a day , it would save 16,433 tonnes of carbon a year, equivalent to tens of thousands of flights to Europe. The problem, however, is that even if the sums involved roughly worked out, it would still be a splash in the pond. The UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions were 435.2 million tonnes in 2019  - so the amount in question here is about 0.0037% of the national picture. And that's if every single British person reduced their email output.  Mike Berners-Lee, a respected professor on the topic whose research was used in the Ovo Energy work,  told the Financial Times it was based  on \"back-of-the-envelope\" maths from 2010 - and while useful to start conversations, there were bigger questions. On top of that, the estimate of how much carbon an email generates \"takes into account absolutely everything involved\", according to Chris Preist, professor of sustainability and computer systems at the University of Bristol.  It tries to include the energy used by servers, your home wi-fi, your laptop - even a very small share of the carbon emitted to construct the data centre buildings. \"The reality is that a lot of the system will still have impact, whether or not the email is sent,\" Prof Preist explains. \"Your laptop will still be on, your wi-fi will still be on, your home internet connection will still be on, the wider network will still use roughly the same amount of energy even with a reduction in volume.  \"There will be a small saving in the data centre hosting the email, particularly if it allows them to use a few less servers. But the carbon saved will be far far less than 1g per email.\" Rather than worrying about relatively low-impact emails, some researchers suggest we should turn our attention to services such as game and video-streaming and cloud storage which have a much larger effect. But the topic is immensely complicated, and there is a debate about how estimates should be calculated - and who should be responsible for it. This video can not be played Big tech firms such as Google, for example, are already proudly carbon-neutral: they pay subsidies for environmental projects to offset the carbon they burn providing your emails - and other services like YouTube. \"What really makes a difference is buying less kit, and keeping it for longer,\" Prof Preist explains. \"But even this is small fry compared with your travel, heating your home, and what you eat.\"  He said consumers should focus their \"eco-guilt\" on things that make a difference - and not sweat the small stuff. \"That is the job of the companies providing the services, who should be designing their systems to deliver services in as energy and resource efficient way as possible.\" His advice on email etiquette and thank you messages? \"Send an email if you feel that the other person will value it, and don't if they won't,\" he said. \"The biggest 'waste' both from an environmental and personal point of view will be the use of time by both of you.\" Is game streaming bad for the environment?

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Scientists have reconstructed a 700-year history of how westerly winds have blown around the Southern Hemisphere. It's a remarkable record that's written in the muds at the bottom of a small lake on the remote Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. What this history reveals is that the strength and latitude of the westerlies is tied closely to temperature. And the implication is that the winds will likely intensify and move poleward as the climate warms. \"What we're seeing in this lake record is that these westerly winds are highly mobile and sensitive to really quite small changes in temperature, and this has some big implications for what the future of our planet looks like,\" Dr Bianca Perren from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) told BBC News. The westerly winds - known by latitude as the roaring forties, furious fifties, and screaming sixties - are hugely influential.  The position of their core belt is linked to drought and wildfire potential on southern landmasses; they also regulate the Southern Ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide and heat by churning its waters; and in recent decades the winds have reshaped the distribution of sea-ice around Antarctica, and have become implicated in the melting of the west of the White Continent by driving warm water under floating glacier fronts. But, you might ask: how does a lake on Marion Island retain a record of these westerly winds? The answer is in the chemistry of its sediments. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, it kicks up a salty spray. When this lands on the island lake, it makes the lake water more saline. This, in turn, alters the biology in the lake, favouring only those tiny algal species, or diatoms, that can tolerate the new salty environment. The stronger the winds, the more salt spray and the more challenging are the conditions in the lake. What this means is that when the scientists drill into the mud at the bottom of the lake, dating its layers and identifying the remains of the dominant species of diatoms through time, they get a multi-century \"proxy\" for the strength of the winds blowing over Marion Island. When this information is combined with other climate records around the Southern Hemisphere, what emerges is a fascinating picture. It shows that during cool periods in recent Earth history, such as the so-called Little Ice Age (roughly AD 1400-1870), the core belt of the winds weakened and shifted towards the equator.  During warm periods, on the other hand (before 1450 and after 1920), the core intensified and migrated poleward. Since the 1960s, instrumental records have documented a continuation of the poleward migration and intensification of the main belt winds - most probably as a result of the atmospheric changes induced by the loss of stratospheric ozone, which was caused by human-produced chemicals that have subsequently been banned.  The question now is whether, as the ozone hole is repaired, global warming steps in to renew and harden the trend. Computer models will take this new information and refine their forecasts. \"This research gives us a little window into what the westerly winds have been doing in the past, and what we can anticipate in the future,\" said Dr Perren. Co-author Dr Dominic Hodgson, also at BAS, added: \"With the rapid changes now occurring in the Earth's climate it is especially important that we use historical data to increase the accuracy of our climate models.  \"This study has revealed the behaviour of the westerly winds long before satellites and on the ground measurements began.  \"It shows us that climate warming drives moisture bearing winds southwards away from Australia, South America and South Africa. The immediate human consequences of this are increased droughts and wildfires.\"  The Marion study is published in  the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment .

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales Environment Correspondent Offering young people work on nature projects and converting empty offices into eco-homes are among the ideas being considered by a \"green recovery\" Welsh Government taskforce. Its boss Sir David Henshaw said it was \"absolutely critical\" climate change was tackled alongside coronavirus. This also means investing \"heavily\" to enable long-term homeworking, he said. His team has received more than 180 ideas for policies and projects and are deciding which to take forward. \"Some of the ideas are challenging but I think we're going to have to be quite brave,\" he said.  \"The danger is that we reach back and use the old levers, if you like, as we try to restart [after Covid-19] and miss what's actually facing us in terms of the [climate] crisis. \"It's an existential threat and we can't just leave it, put it to one side of the desk and wait to catch up with it. We have to take the two together.\" Sir David - chairman of environment watchdog Natural Resources Wales and formerly chief executive of Liverpool City Council - was asked by the Welsh Government to lead  its green recovery taskforce .   As well as working out how to help cash-strapped environmental charities and voluntary groups continue their work, they were told to come up with ideas to fight climate change and nature loss while creating jobs and strengthening the economy. They are set to report to Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths later this autumn. Ideas being considered range from \"small local projects to very big ones across the whole of Wales,\" Sir David said. They include measures to boost horticulture farming so fruit and vegetables can be sourced more locally.  They are also looking at volunteering, work experience and apprenticeship opportunities, for example in nature conservation, energy efficiency, woodland planting, or peatland restoration.  Sir David said improving infrastructure that allows people to work from home - which he described as \"not good enough\" - was a key priority. The hope for a greener future is driving the team behind a new college in Talgarth, Powys. \"Black Mountains College came about as an idea specifically in response to the climate and nature emergencies in order to produce new kinds of graduates,\" said director Ben Rawlence. With a focus on teaching sustainability, ecology, heritage skills and implementing Wales' Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, they hope the courses will prepare students for \"a very different net zero future\". While vocational courses on topics such as regenerative horticulture - which helps keep soil healthy - will start next year, the college hopes to offer a programme for undergraduate students from 2022, working towards taking on 600 students a year. \"We hope we can be a catalyst for regeneration for mid Wales as a whole - helping stem the brain drain of young people over the border to England to study further and higher education,\" Mr Rawlence added. He said society needed to think differently about how the economy works. \"The economy is about the relationship between people and the environment, and if there's no environment there's no relationship.\" Ffion Storer Jones, of the Rural Youth Project, echoed this sentiment and said the last few months had highlighted how quickly changes can be achieved. \"Young people have been on the streets for years now asking for change and the pandemic has shown us that a different way of life is possible - where we work within the boundaries of the planet to create a world that's better both for the environment and people.\" Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief Young people hit as unemployment rate rises Natural Resources Wales - NRW led taskforce set to accelerate a green recovery in Wales Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Madrid UN negotiators meeting in Madrid have been accused of \"playing politics\" while the climate crisis grows. The talks - now in their final week - are bogged down in technical details as key countries seek to delay efforts to increase their pledges, observers say.  Ministers are due to arrive in the Spanish capital this week to try to secure an ambitious outcome. US presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg is due to attend, while Greta Thunberg will also address the meeting.  This video can not be played Up to  half a million people took part in a march in Madrid  in support of rapid climate action, but according to observers, negotiators haven't got the message.  \"The problem is while hundreds of thousands of people are marching outside in Madrid, and school children are striking, countries are playing politics with the negotiations,\" said Mohammed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a climate and energy think tank based in Nairobi, who's an observer at these talks. \"We need ministers to arrive this week and make some real progress.\" Inside the convention centre, the central question of increasing country pledges to cut their carbon has been pushed aside as negotiators resort to protecting  national interests. Back in 2015, everyone signed up to the Paris agreement and put new plans on the table that are due to run from 2020. However the richer countries were supposed to undertake specific carbon cutting actions in the years between 2015 and 2020, which many haven't yet achieved.  Here in Madrid a group of countries including China, India and Saudi Arabia are pushing for these pre-2020 commitments be adhered to - even if it means achieving them post-2020. Observers believe this is partly a negotiating tactic designed to put pressure on richer nations in any discussions about improving pledges in the period after 2020. There is frustration that countries are focussing on trying to get advantages in the talks, instead of working together to increase ambition. \"The Paris agreement is clear: all countries agreed to deliver new climate targets by 2020, and as the recent UNEP emissions gap report made clear, the onus is on the top 10 polluters to deliver,\" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the key architects of the Paris agreement, now with the European Climate Foundation. \"I know leaders in Brussels, Delhi, Beijing, Tokyo and Ottawa care about global action, but we need them to deliver this week. We need their leadership to deliver on their Paris commitments.\" As well as the pre-2020 question, the talks are stuck on two tricky, technical issues - one about the question of loss and damage, the other about carbon markets. Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement deals with the trading of emissions reductions credits that might arise from a country beating its own pledges or from a public or private initiative that cut emissions, such as a renewable energy plant or the restoration of a forest.  Here in Madrid, as last year in Katowice, countries are struggling to agree the rules of how these markets would work.  A number of countries including Brazil want to carry over credits that were created under previous versions of this scheme.  The worry is that many of these historical credits are not real reductions. If they are used by countries to meet part or all of their pledges they simply dilute real efforts to cut carbon. The question of loss and damage sees developing countries looking for a new facility in the UN talks that would deal with the impacts of events like sea level rise or major storms that have a climate component.  They argue that the poorest are the ones feeling the impacts of a climate they didn't create.  Rich countries have long resisted the idea feeling they will be on the hook for billions of dollars for centuries to come.  Up to now these discussions have been led by civil servants, but the arrival of ministers will likely clarify if both can be resolved by political horse trading.  It's possible that a compromise could be arrived at that would see both issues resolved here. Or not! While the interventions of Michael Bloomberg and Greta Thunberg will likely gain headlines, there is still uncertainty over whether a final decision can be taken here that will be ambitious and set out a clear timeline for countries to get their pledges on the table ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in November 2020.  There is hope that a large number of countries will sign up to long term net-zero emissions targets, and if that happens it will be significant progress.  But many eyes here will be closely watching Brussels this week where the new EU commission is due to present a European Green Deal.  \"What happens in Brussels will resonate in Madrid,\" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Climate change driven by industrial society is having an increasing impact on the UK\u2019s weather, the Met Office says.  Its annual UK report confirms that 2019 was the 12th warmest year in a series from 1884.  Although it does not make the top 10, the report says 2019 was remarkable for high temperature records in the UK. There was also a severe swing in weather from the soaking winter to the sunny spring. The temperature extremes were: No national low temperature records were set in the State of the UK Climate report, published by the Royal Meteorological Society.  This video can not be played It shows that UK temperatures in 2019 were 1.1\u00b0 C above the 1961-1990 long-term average. Mike Kendon, lead author of the report, said: \u201cOur report shows climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK.  \u201cThis year was warmer than any other year in the UK between 1884 and 1990, and to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963.\u201d The Central England Temperature series is the longest instrumental record of temperature in the world, stretching back to 1659. Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, added it was a particularly wet year across parts of central and northern England. He said Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Cheshire received between a quarter to one third more rainfall than normal. For northern England this was the ninth wettest year in a series from 1862. He said: \"It\u2019s worth noting that since 2009 the UK has now had its wettest February, April, June, November and December on record \u2013 five out of 12 months.\" Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, identified a number of concerning trends.  She said: \"As well as extreme hot temperatures, the stand-out weather events in 2019 were the many different types of floods, causing millions of pounds worth of damage and causing misery to many people. \u201cThe picture that emerges is of the multiple flooding threats that are facing the UK, many of which are exacerbated by climate change.\" She cited as examples summer flash floods caused by extreme downpours, extensive autumn and winter river floods caused by persistent heavy rain and storms, and a backdrop of continued sea-level rises heightening the risk of coastal floods. Professor Ilan Kelman, from University College London, said heat would become an increasing problem. He said: \"These UK records show that if we do nothing about stopping climate change we are on track for summer heat and humidity which would be highly dangerous for us to be outdoors - and to be indoors without continual cooling.\u201d Gareth Redmond King from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said: \u201cThese are records we shouldn\u2019t be breaking. Tropical temperatures may be nice on occasion, but here in the UK they are a stark reminder that we are in a climate crisis.   \u201cThe whole world has to act ahead of next year\u2019s UN climate conference; and as hosts we must urgently raise our ambition if the UK is to show global leadership.  \u201cRight now, that means investing in a green recovery in the coming budget and spending review, for the sake of both people and planet.\u201d Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The speed and extent of current global warming exceeds any similar event in the past 2,000 years, researchers say. They show that famous historic events like the \"Little Ice Age\" don't compare with the scale of warming seen over the last century.  The  research suggests  that the current warming rate is higher than any observed previously. The scientists say it shows many of the arguments used by climate sceptics are no longer valid. When scientists have surveyed the climatic history of our world over the past centuries a number of key eras have stood out.  These ranged from the \"Roman Warm Period\", which ran from AD 250 to AD 400, and saw unusually warm weather across Europe, to the famed Little Ice Age, which saw temperatures drop for centuries from the 1300s.  The events were seen by some as evidence that the world has warmed and cooled many times over the centuries and that the warming seen in the world since the industrial revolution was part of that pattern and therefore nothing to be alarmed about.  Three new research papers show that argument is on shaky ground. The science teams reconstructed the climate conditions that existed over the past 2,000 years using 700 proxy records of temperature changes, including tree rings, corals and lake sediments. They determined that none of these climate events occurred on a global scale.  The researchers say that, for example, the Little Ice Age was at its strongest in the Pacific Ocean in the 15th Century, while in Europe it was the 17th Century.   Generally, any longer-term peaks or troughs in temperature could be detected in no more than half the globe at any one time, The \"Medieval Warm Period\", which ran between AD 950 and AD 1250 only saw significant temperature rises across 40% of the Earth's surface. Today's warming, by contrast, impacts the vast majority of the world.  \"We find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the 20th Century for more than 98% of the globe,\" one of the papers states.  \"This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic (human induced) global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.\" What the researchers saw is that prior to the modern industrial era, the most significant influence on climate was volcanoes. They found no indication that variations in the Sun's radiation impacted mean global temperatures. The current period, say the authors, significantly exceeds natural variability. \"We see from the instrumental data and also from our reconstruction that in the recent past the warming rate clearly exceeds the natural warming rates that we calculated - that's another view to look at the extraordinary nature of the present warming,\" said Dr Raphael Neukom, from the University of Bern, Switzerland. While the researchers did not set out to test whether humans were the chief influence on the current climate, their findings indicate clearly that this is the case.  \"We do not focus on looking at what's causing the most recent warming as this has been done many times and the evidence is always agreeing that it is the anthropogenic cause,\" said Dr Neukom. \"We do not explicitly test this; we can only show that natural causes are not sufficient from our data to actually cause the spatial pattern and the warming rate that we are observing now.\"  Other scientists have been impressed with the quality of the new studies.  \"They have done this across the globe with more than 700 records over the past 2,000 years; they have corals and lakes and also instrumental data,\" said Prof Daniela Schmidt from the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved with the studies.  \"And they have been very careful in assessing the data and the inherent bias that any data has, so the quality of this data and the coverage of this data is the real major advance here; it is amazing.\" Many experts say that this new work debunks many of the claims made by climate sceptics in recent decades. \"This paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle,\" said Prof Mark Maslin, from University College London, UK, who wasn't part of the studies.  \"This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.\" The three papers have been published in the journals Nature  (1)  and Nature Geoscience  (2) ,  (3) .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Joe Biden's plan to tackle climate change has been described as the most ambitious of any mainstream US presidential candidate yet. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers what he wants to do, and how he might get it done. Much will be made about Joe Biden's pledge to re-join the Paris climate agreement, the international pact designed to avoid dangerous warming of the Earth. President Trump pulled out of the deal after the Obama administration had signed up in 2016, and during the drawn-out election count, Mr Biden confirmed that reversing the decision would be one of his first acts as president. But key to his credibility on the international stage will be his domestic policies on cutting carbon emissions. More radical Democrats such as congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez have put forward a proposal called the  Green New Deal , which would eliminate carbon emissions from most sources over a decade. The  Biden climate plan  is more moderate. However, if enacted, it would still be the most progressive climate strategy the US has ever attempted.  Mr Biden is proposing to make US electricity production carbon-free by 2035 and to have the country achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century.  Reaching net zero requires that any carbon emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees.  Once in office, Joe Biden wants to spend $2 trillion over four years to drive down emissions by upgrading four million buildings to make them more energy efficient.  He wants to spend heavily on public transport, to invest in electric vehicle manufacturing and charging points and give consumers financial incentives to trade up to cleaner cars. All of these options have one additional component apart from cutting carbon: they put people back to work.  Andrew Light, a former senior climate official in the Obama administration, says Mr Biden is focused on what lowers emissions and increases jobs at the same time. \"There will be a big push on electric vehicles, a big push on efficient buildings, both residential and offices, a big push on creating a new kind of civilian conservation corps and doing a lot of nature-based solutions on climate change. \"You've got a really good menu to choose from in all of these different sectors.\" Mr Biden has also said he will not allow fracking on federal land. Fracking is a drilling process in which chemicals are injected into rocks to liberate natural gas and oil, and is controversial because of its environmental impact. However, since about 90% of it occurs on state or private land, the vast majority of fracking will be unaffected. The Paris deal sought to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2.0C (3.6F), but in 2018 UN scientists  clarified how much of a difference it would make to limit the rise to 1.5C. The 1.5C target could prevent small island states from sinking beneath the waves, it could ensure that millions of people avoid the disasters of extreme weather, it could limit the chances of an ice-free Arctic in the Summer.  Scientists say that Mr Biden's goal of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century could have significant implications for the 1.5C target.  \"With Biden's election, China, the USA , EU, Japan, South Korea - two thirds of the world economy and over 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions - would have [commitments toward reaching] net zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century,\" says Bill Hare, who's part of the  Climate Action Tracker , which monitors the world's carbon cutting plans. \"This could be an historic tipping point.\" For the first time ever, this puts the Paris Agreement's 1.5C limit within striking distance, he says. There will be a Democrat in the White House, but the Republican party currently controls the US Senate and has so far shown a marked reluctance to spend money on stimulating the economy, despite the pandemic. That position might change if - as some have forecast - a January run-off election in Georgia gives Democrats control of the Senate. But if not, there are still grounds for President-elect Biden to believe the upper house may be open to some of his climate plans.  While President Trump has taken a strident anti-climate approach, there has been a softening of rhetoric from some Republicans in the last couple of years.  There are already precedents of co-operation to point to. In September,  Democrats and Republicans co-operated on a bill to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) , a family of gases commonly used as refrigerants. They include some of the most powerful greenhouse gases known to science. The same month, the Senate also passed a bill called the  Bipartisan Wildlife Conservation Act , intended to improve species conservation and protect vital ecosystems. Joe Biden also knows better than many how navigate the upper house; he was elected to the senate six times before serving as vice-president under Barack Obama.  If the president-elect can structure his plans so that they create jobs and new infrastructure, while also tackling carbon emissions, he may be able to find a way forward that works for both sides of the aisle. \"I think you could get a lot of common ground just around good policies that also have climate implications,\" says Katie Tubb, a senior policy analyst from the conservative think tank, the  Heritage Foundation .  If he fails to agree legislation with the Senate, President-elect Biden will have to issue executive orders, similar to the way that Presidents Obama and Trump overcame such obstacles.  President Trump used them to roll back dozens of environmental regulations on the production of oil and gas, and on  mileage standards for cars and trucks .  It's expected that many of those Trump rollbacks will themselves be rolled back at the start of the Biden administration. But the weakness of the executive approach is that it is open to legal challenges. President Obama had to use executive orders to try and implement a key climate policy, the  Clean Power Plan , but they were blocked by the Supreme Court. If President-elect Biden goes down this route, the Supreme Court could present a potential stumbling block.  The court would ultimately rule on any litigation over his climate proposals, and with the court's strong conservative majority, that could be a significant problem for Joe Biden. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accords took effect on 4 November - the day after the election. A month after the Biden administration informs the United Nations of its decision to re-join, the US will once again be part of the global effort to curb climate change - much to the delight of climate diplomats.  \"It would definitely be a positive move, not only because they are a big player, but I think because it really emphasises the fact that the US believes in the science of climate change,\" says Carlos Fuller, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) in annual UN climate meetings. These annual COP - conference of the parties - meetings are the mechanism by which countries agree to lower their carbon emissions. And US leadership is absolutely critical for this process. With China, Japan and South Korea having set long-term goals to cut carbon, expectations are rising that the UN's COP26 climate summit, which convenes in Glasgow in November 2021, may turn out to be a success. The UK government, which will run the Glasgow talks, will want every country to update their national carbon cutting plans with tougher targets than they submitted in in 2015. They will also want as many nations as possible to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.  The return of the US to the climate fold, under President-elect Biden, will bring both goals within reach.

{"id":null,"body":"US President Donald Trump has declared that wildfires burning through homes and devastating precious forestry in parts of California are a major disaster and has released federal aid. Over 14,000 firefighters are battling 585 fires that have now burnt nearly one million acres (400,000 hectares). Forecast high winds are threatening to drive flames into more populated areas as foul air blankets the state. At least six people have died and thousands have evacuated. Most of the destruction has been caused by three large fire complexes in mountainous and wooded rural areas.  On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the SCU Lightning Complex fire south and east of San Francisco was the third-largest in the state's history. Video tweeted by the governor showed burnt tree stumps against the reddened fumes-filled sky and plumes of white smoke rising from ash-laden ground. An  evacuation order on Saturday  extended to thousands of people in the Bay area near San Jose and warned others to be prepared to abandon their homes at short notice. Surveying the SCU Lightning Complex -- this is now the third largest wildfire in CA history.  pic.twitter.com\/MKhVD8u48U Exhausted firefighters continue to battle the flames, with some working 72-hour shifts in the dangerous, hot conditions,  reports AP news agency . \"They're scrambling for bodies\" to help fight the fires, an official in the city of Fresno told Reuters news agency. In California's oldest state park, flames scorched redwood trees that began their lives more than 2,000 years ago. The historic visitor centre of Big Basin State Park was burnt to the ground and officials say some trees, which tower as high as 330ft (100 metres), have fallen as the area was \"extensively damaged\". The state faces a more acute shortage of personnel than usual - the coronavirus pandemic has depleted a fire-fighting corps made up of prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, due to early releases from jail. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. After doubling in size on Friday, the fires continued to grow moderately on Saturday and firefighters made some progress in containing the flames. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes last week during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reached  what could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded . The largest wildfire, called the LNU Lightning complex, is in the prominent wine-growing areas of Napa and Sonoma north of San Francisco and is just 15% contained, CalFire said on Saturday. Further south in Santa Cruz county, 115 homes have been destroyed and some residents evacuated.  \"I left with my clothes... two guitars and a dog,\" one evacuee in Santa Cruz told CNN affiliate KGO. Firefighters dug a fireline around the University of California Santa Cruz campus as flames came within a mile of the buildings and surrounding area. Gov Newsom has requested help from as far afield as Australia and Canada. Firefighters, engines and surveillance planes raced in from US states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. Although California is used to wildfire, the governor called the fires unlike anything the state had seen before.  \"If you don't believe in climate change, come to California,\"  he tweeted on Saturday. With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature.  Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. Officials also advise people to remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing electricity shortages, which have caused rolling blackouts for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts. Satellite images show smoke blanketing nearly all of California, as well most of Nevada and southern Idaho.

{"id":null,"body":"By Nuala McCann BBC News NI In March, as shutters clattered on shop windows, lights went off in restaurants and office doors were locked, there was peace to be found in the woods. If lockdown had a silver lining, for many people, it was a renewed love of nature. Ian McCurley, director of the Woodland Trust NI, has seen a huge increase in numbers across the countryside. \"I'm seeing people walking in country lanes where I've never seen them before,\" he said. The Woodland Trust is the largest woodland conservation charity in the UK. It has more than 500,000 supporters. It wants to see a UK rich in native woods and trees for people and wildlife. Carnmoney Wood is a site that is run by the trust. \"It's a steep climb,\" Mr McCurley said, \"but that has not stopped people walking there. \"In lockdown, people seemed to value getting out, perhaps because we were told not to do it as much.\" \"People baked a lot of bread, did DIY and gardens and took their daily exercise... so they became aware of just how important the outdoors is. \"We have had more people inquiring and wanting to help us.\" In the run-up to the pandemic in March, climate change was in the spotlight.   Swedish climate activist  Greta Thunberg called out world leaders , and had gathered a global youth movement hungry for change. \"It took the younger generation to get really fired up.  This was a big wave, a huge opportunity and I don't think it has gone away,\" said Mr McCurley. \"In the pandemic, people have had time to think. They want to get outside and we want to bring them there.\" He pointed to three crises  - species in decline and habitats fragmented; nature deficit disorder where people, especially children, are disconnected from nature and the food chain as well as climate change. \"Trees are the most cost effective method of delivering and resolving the nature and climate crises. They also have positive impacts on people's mental health and well being,\" he said. Trees help clean air, store carbon, clean our rivers and provide havens for wildlife. But Northern Ireland has a poor reputation with just 8% tree cover. It is the least wooded area in the whole of the UK and one of the least wooded places in all of Europe.  In its Emergency Tree Plan, published in January 2020, the trust said we would need to  plant 2,000 hectares of trees a year in Northern Ireland  to hit an existing target of 12% cover by 2050.   In 2018\/2019, just 240 hectares were planted in Northern Ireland. Good news came in March, just as the threat of Covid-19 moved frighteningly close, when   Environment Minister Edwin Poots  promised to plant 18 million trees at a cost of \u00a380m over the next 10 years to store carbon and improve Northern Ireland's woodland cover. He told the Stormont assembly it would deliver 9,000 hectares by 2030. Agencies such as NI Water and the Roads Service, which own large swathes of land, will be key to the plan called Forests For Our Future. For conservationists, like the Woodland Trust, that future is looking brighter. Lockdown has not dimmed its vision of a future where farming is more ecologically minded. \"We need to make a steep change. So Edwin Poots' announcement was very welcome,\" said Mr McCurley. \"The minister can pull together farming and woodland into a more combined vision for land use.  \"Climate change legislation will draw in every aspect of government - moving the environmental areas into the heart of government as opposed to being held in the environment sector \" The trust is behind 50 new woodland sites across NI since 2000.   This year, it created the single, largest native woodland in Northern Ireland.  Aughrim Hill, in the Mourne Mountains, County Down, is being transformed from a bare hillside with no tree cover to a habitat with more than 110,000 native trees.  Scots pine, birch, oak and cherry will flourish and these natural woodlands will be havens for wildlife like red squirrels as well as for human visitors. Although our tree cover is very poor, some of our trees are celebrated on the international stage. A tunnel of beech trees known as the  Dark Hedges featured as the Kingsroad in the HBO Series Game of Thrones  and has drawn thousands of fans to the Antrim coast. It is thought the trees were planted in 1775 by the Stuart family along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion. After Games of Thrones, so many people travelled by car to see the trees near Armoy that the traffic had to be banned to reduce man-made damage. At the age of 245, the beeches are now in the winter of their lives.  They are, in the words of one tree expert, \"old age pensioners\" - another said they have less than 10 years left. The Woodland Trust runs a competition for Tree of the Year across Northern Ireland. Past winners have included the mysterious \"invisible tree\", the big Oak, the King tree and the Crom yews. The  Holm Oak, Kilbroney Park has also won . It is known by locals as \"Old Homer\" - a name that suggests the great wisdom that comes with age. Musician Tommy Sands who knows it well has said it was a deserved winner. \"My vote goes for the bendy tree that may be bent but not broken.  \"It was, for many years, the tree that we gathered under during the festival for children's concerts, and will be again,\" he said. The Woodland Trust hopes that, like Old Homer, many more native trees will grace the landscape, grant nature the reprieve that is desperately needed and be celebrated in years to come.

{"id":null,"body":"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who \"built this country\", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances.  With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues.  Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme.  He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend \"whatever it takes\" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his \"Build Back Better\" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (\u00a311.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce \"Buy American\" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas.  His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology.  In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his \"build back\" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised \"tough-on-crime\" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty.  However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme.  Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing \"green energy\" products.  Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts.  The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China \"can't afford to ignore\", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the \"Dreamers\" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid.  In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access. These would be paid using money gained back from withdrawing the Trump-era tax cuts.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Agreed by 196 parties in the French capital in December 2015, the Paris climate deal aims to keep the rise in global temperatures this century \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.\" We look at five key countries and how well they have kept their promises. Every one of the signatories to the Paris climate agreement has had to lodge a climate action plan with the UN to spell out what steps they are taking to curb carbon.  Overall, according to a new assessment from global consultancy Systemiq, low-carbon solutions have been more successful in this period than many people realise.   The growth in coal for energy outside of China has declined significantly.  \"We have to translate what we can do into what we will do,\" said Lord Nicholas Stern, from the London School of Economics (LSE). \"But a big part of that is understanding what is happening and that's why I think this report is important. It will change people's perspectives of what is possible and translate that into action.\" So the big picture might be improving, but what about individual nations? We looked at how five key countries have lived up to their promises under the pact. As well as being the world's fifth largest economy, the UK is the incoming president of the Conference of the Parties or COP, the main UN climate negotiating forum, which will take place in Glasgow in November 2021.  This global gathering of world leaders will try and work out how to improve the collective effort to tackle climate change, and take the next steps.  COP26 in Glasgow will be the most important meeting since the Paris climate agreement was signed five years ago.  The president of the meeting is a key influence on the success or failure of the event.  In Paris in 2015, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius was seen as a  hugely effective, impartial leader  who gained the trust of nations rich and poor.   UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has already been tasked with the job by Boris Johnson, but already  there are worries that he has too much on his plate .  Has the UK lived up to its promises?  The answer to this is mostly yes.  Since 2008, the UK government has had to set five-year greenhouse gas targets by law, based on advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). Targets set under the first three carbon budgets have been met. While it was part of the EU, the UK's target for 2020 was a reduction of 16% on 2005 emissions.  The UK easily achieved this. In fact, right now, Britain's total output of warming gases has gone down by around 45% from 1990 levels. As a result of leaving the EU, the UK has to register its own standalone plan to cut carbon with the UN.  This is known as a \"nationally determined contribution\" or NDC. It focuses on targets for 2030, which are meant to show the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. Reaching net zero requires that any carbon emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. The  new 2030 plan , released on 3 December, won plaudits for its ambition. But critics said there were major hurdles ahead. Under the NDC, around 87% of UK electricity would need to come from low carbon sources by the end of this decade, up from over 50% now. Almost half the cars on the road would need to be electric, up from around 6% at present. As well as making major changes to transport, energy and food emissions, the UK will have to take a tough stand internationally so that it doesn't simply substitute carbon cuts at home with emissions-laden products from abroad. \"It's what you do at home, but it's also what you invest in internationally,\" Dr Alison Doig, from the  Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) , told BBC News.  \"The UK needs to ensure with our export finance credits and with our Brexit deals, that we are strongly signalling overseas, what we're doing domestically.\" Nevertheless, in April 2021, the government announced that it would speed up its emissions-cutting plan. Boris Johnson said carbon releases would be reduced by 78% by 2035 - taking the country more than three quarters of the way to net zero. Australia matters because not only is it one of the biggest sources of fossil fuels, it is also a country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The nation is now the world's largest exporter of coal and gas, according to a  recent study . Emissions of greenhouse gases from Australian exports are responsible for 3.6% of global emissions  according to research . On a per capita basis, and including exports, Australians are responsible for four times as much CO2 as people living in the US. Politically, Australia is also very important in climate change terms as well.  Over the past five years, it has moved further away from the majority of nations in the UN, which have been urging rapid cuts in carbon. Prime minister Scott Morrison was  criticised by other politicians  for downplaying the role of climate change after recent, devastating wildfires. Has Australia lived up to its promises? Not really. While it is set to hit a rather low 2020 target set under a previous global agreement, its actions under the Paris climate agreement are not measuring up, according to experts.  Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels. Projections published at the end of 2019 suggested Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030. This year's UN Emissions Gap report says that, right now Australia is projected to fall short on what should be a very easy target. \"That 26% reduction needs to be at least double that to be in the Paris Agreement pathway,\" says Dr Bill Hare, who's part of the  Climate Action Tracker  group of scientists who have rated Australia's plans as \"insufficient\". \"There's very little going on whether you're talking about electric vehicles, motor vehicle standards, it's alone in the OECD in not having fuel efficiency standards, it has virtually nothing on energy efficiency, and virtually nothing on building efficiency.\" \"It is really an embarrassment actually.\" There's a lot of focus on Australia now because of changing world politics.  A dispute with China has threatened its exports of coal, while the result of the recent US election has taken away a climate ally of the Australian government. There's even been some talk in recent weeks that the country might soon set a long-term net-zero emissions goal. And  according to newspaper reports , Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to announce that the country will no longer use carbon credits carried over from a previous international climate agreement.  Australia had planned to use these questionable credits as a way of making up the shortfall in its 2030 target.  \"I think if Trump had won the election then Australia would see themselves as part of a gang with Brazil and Saudi Arabia and a few others,\" said Dr Alison Doig, from the ECIU. But with the dawn of the Biden era, \"they know are in a position that's becoming more outcast. So that might be why there's some softening on local language and the rhetoric\". While action at the federal level in Australia might be slow, lower down there's a good deal of movement.  \"Our energy market operator has said that for the power sector in Australia, we're looking at the fastest transition in the world,\" said Dr Bill Hare.   \"Everyone knows that we're famous for our sunshine, our wind and our space. And that means that renewables are cheap, they are rapidly outcompeting coal and gas, and those technologies are going to be replaced very quickly.\" The EU represents about a fifth of the world's economy - and  was responsible for around 9% of the global share of CO2 emissions in 2019,  the third largest emitter.  Climate change is seen as a key issue for Europe, because it's an international problem where acting together makes sense to many citizens. Europe's political leaders also see tackling climate as important in showing the global relevance of the Union. During the Trump administration, the EU stepped into a leadership role, attempting to build bridges with China on how to tackle the challenge.  The EU is well-regarded generally among developing countries and small island states because they are seen as wanting to push for greater ambition in terms of cutting carbon.  In terms of building a global alliance of rich and poor countries the EU is key.   Has the EU lived up to its targets? Mostly, yes. But back in 2007, EU leaders set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% of their 1990 levels by 2020.  By 2018, the collective efforts had cut warming gases by 23.2%.  This over-achievement caused many to think that the initial targets had been set far too low.  The EU subsequently announced a target of 40% for 2030, but this too came to be viewed as too easy to meet. The bloc has now adopted the aim of having a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.   And in the  European Green Deal , announced in September 2020, the European Commission proposed a new target for cuts of around 55% by 2030. In April 2021, ahead of President Biden's climate leaders' summit, the EU adopted the goal. The European Parliament and many environmentalists had wanted them to go further and aim for a 60% cut. But the proposal ran into trouble with Eastern European member states who argued this was too much, too soon. China is key to solving the global problem with climate change, because it is the world's biggest contributor to the root cause, CO2 emissions.  As China's economy rapidly expanded over the past two decades, using coal as their main energy source, their emissions have overtaken the US and now comprise around 28% of the global CO2 output.  But China is also the reason for a recent burst of optimism that has spread through the international community since September, when China's President Xi Jinping  told the UN  that his country would reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Has China lived up to its promises? The answer is mostly, yes, but with some caveats. Seeing itself as a developing country, China has always been reluctant to take on targets to cut carbon, arguing that the West should go first and farthest to rein in CO2.  Instead, China has focussed on carbon intensity rather than cuts. This means limiting the amount of CO2 used per unit of economic activity.  This is easier to achieve than outright emissions reductions but the downside is that as GDP increases so does the overall total of carbon used. Before the Copenhagen conference of the parties meeting (COP) in 2009, China pledged to cut its carbon intensity by 40-45%, compared to 2005 levels.  At the end of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46% from the 2005 level. In the Paris Agreement, China promised to cut carbon intensity by 60-65%, and to peak its emissions by 2030.  The country remains on course to meet these goals. In fact,  according to some research , it could meet them years ahead of schedule.  \"I think China took the conservative approach to the Paris Agreement, they only proposed something that they were very sure that they could meet,\" says Niklas H\u00f6hne from the Climate Action Tracker.  \"It was also clear that at, the moment when they proposed their 2030 target, that they would over-achieve it. And that doesn't mean that that it's a bad target, per se, but that's their way of approaching it.\" When President Xi Jinping told the UN in September that China would reach net-zero in 2060 and peak its emissions well before 2030, the statement was welcomed all over the world. But observers said targets contained in the country's five-year plan, released in March 2021, could lead to emissions continuing to increase. A new Chinese national commitment is to be submitted to the UN in the run up to the Glasgow COP26 meeting. But there are significant challenges. \"The nature of the peaking in the 2030 target can be only measured in a 100% certain way after the fact,\" said Dr Shuwei Zhang, from the Draworld Environment Research Centre in Beijing.  \"The 2060 neutrality goal is theoretically possible, but could become unfeasible in reality, if action is continuously delayed.\"  \"From now, there is no leeway to accommodate coal any longer.\"  China will have to limit coal for energy, not just inside the country but outside as well.  The financing of overseas coal power plants will have to wind down. Right now, the country's  emissions have rebounded  in the wake of the pandemic, as coal continues to burn brightly. But many remain optimistic that, if China says it can do something, then it will get there. The Philippines is one of the countries suffering the most from  the impacts of climate change .  Like many other developing economies, the country is very keen to use energy to bring people out of poverty and raise living standards.  In the past, the Philippines has looked to significantly increase investment in coal to foster development.  But its current approach seeks to move away from coal, and experts say the country could be a role model for many developing nations in similar situations.  Has the Philippines lived up to its promises? Up until the Paris Agreement, the Philippines had not had any international requirements to curb its carbon. But in the Paris pact, it committed to cut its emissions by 70% below \"business as usual\" by 2030.  According to the Climate Action Tracker analysis, its actions to date are compatible with keeping warming well below 2C this century. In 2019, around half the country's electricity came from coal - and plans in the pipeline would have more than doubled the country's coal fired capacity. But in October 2020,  the government announced a moratorium on new coal plants , preferring instead to pursue a more mixed energy strategy. According to the Climate Action Tracker, this could curb emissions from the Philippines by 35% on top of their current policy projections by 2030. \"I think that one of the most critical factors is that the market has been very important in the power sector,\" said Dr Bill Hare.  \"In other countries in Southeast Asia, we have what's called political economy, vested interests dominate in places such as Vietnam or Indonesia.\" \"But in the Philippines, the market has been really important in determining investments for quite some time. And I think that's what we're seeing unfolding, multiplied by a government predisposition now towards renewables, and a realisation that, as a very vulnerable country, they really need to be getting their act together.\" The expectation of observers is that with funding from the UN's  Green Climate Fund  and more focus on sustainability from international banks, the move away from fossil fuels in the Philippines in the longer term will likely speed up.  The Philippines has not yet set a long-term goal, but it says it is committed to submitting a new national climate plan with enhanced targets.  The country will also likely push for further action on a concept known as \"loss and damage\" within the UN negotiation process. For developing nations, this means financial recompense for the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided or adapted to. But richer countries are strongly resistant, believing that because they contributed the most to carbon emissions, they will be on the hook for compensation for centuries to come.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Young people will be left to pick up the bill for climate change because politicians are dodging the issue, a UK report warns. The government must act faster to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road traffic, homes and farming, the Committee on Climate Change says. Without action, the coming generation will have to pay much more to curb emissions in a heating world.  The government says it is committed to being a world leader on climate change.  It will introduce its low-carbon transport plan soon. The advisers are \"acutely concerned\" at the UK's lack of progress in cutting the carbon emissions overheating the planet. The committee says the UK made a good start with the power industry but emissions cuts have effectively stalled in the past five years. Members say it will be much cheaper, for instance, to begin a steady changeover to electric cars now than to have to rush the technology in years to come. What is climate change? Climate change 'hurts women more' 2017: 'Warmest year without El Ni\u00f1o' A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves) Since 2012, 75% of emissions cuts have come from power.  Coal power stations in the UK are  being phased out  - they are the worst polluters.  Renewables have proved far cheaper than anyone thought.  The government has banned subsidies for onshore wind - even though analysts say that will add to energy bills. In addition, communities have been given the say as to whether they can go ahead or not. This means that just a few objections are needed to block the progress of wind projects. But the committee says onshore wind and solar will be even cheaper than burning gas for electricity in the 2020s.  If it's dumped in a landfill, food and plant matter will rot and create methane, which contributes to climate change. Councils have been asking people to separate food and garden waste from general waste.  Now, companies are increasingly trying to capture methane from food waste and harness it to make useful biogas.  But after a good start, emissions cuts are stalling. Making fertiliser emits greenhouse gases. And so does spreading animal dung on the fields to help crops grow.  Farm machines pollute. And cutting wood for farms is problematic for the climate too, because trees soak up CO2. The government says it will help more farmers combat climate change.  People are buying bigger and heavier cars.  The government removed the fuel duty incentive for low-pollution cars, so now a Porsche can be taxed at the same rate as a clean Toyota Prius.  What is more, concern about pollution from diesels has shifted some drivers to petrol cars.  They create less pollution but more greenhouse gases.  The committee says sales of electric cars and installation of charging points are both too slow. Getting people to insulate their homes to save wasting heat is a big challenge.   The committee says insulation rates in homes are 95% lower because of grants cuts. It wants ministers to insist that all new homes are zero-carbon.  We also have to start experiments on a large scale with actually capturing the CO2 gas from industry and storing it in rocks underground, it says. The committee says part of the problem is that responsibility for cutting emissions is split between various government departments.  They don't all see tackling climate change as a key priority. But a spokesperson for the UK government said: \"We've proven ourselves to be world-leaders in tackling climate change - cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and producing record levels of low carbon energy.  \"We're confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth.\" People committed to personally tackling climate change can avoid flying and eating meat - two of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases. They maybe walk or cycle instead of taking the car - and they try to insulate their homes or turn the heating down.  They recycle too - but that probably helps less with the climate than many people think. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By BBC News Staff As several papers show images of children returning to the classroom,  the Daily Mail  features an empty rush-hour railway station and asks: \"They're back at work, where's the rest of the UK?\"   The Guardian says  37% of UK office workers have gone back to the workplace, compared with more than three-quarters in Germany, Italy and Spain. A survey for the i newspaper  has found that 60% of businesses believe staff should return by the end of this year - while only 42% of workers are of the same view, citing concerns about the health risks of using public transport.   More than 80% of both employers and employees see remote working becoming a core part of their operation. The Daily Telegraph accuses the government of a \"lacklustre campaign to reassure commuters\" and warns that the country \"is in danger of sleepwalking into economic catastrophe\".   The paper reveals  that a record 500,000 under-25s are claiming benefits - almost double the figure before lockdown - which it says is causing growing concern about the economic impact of Covid-19 on the younger generation.   Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The columnists are quick to grade the government's performances on their \"first day of term\" after the parliamentary recess.   Isabel Hardman of the Spectator says  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was castigated by opposition MPs after he \"failed to hand his homework in on time\", giving them very late advance notice of his statement to the House.  But she says he escaped a \"public dressing down\" from Conservative MPs, despite many being annoyed by his handling of the exams \"fiasco\".    Huffpost UK suggests  there \"was clearly a whips operation to circle the wagons round the education secretary\", in contrast with Health Secretary Matt Hancock's turn at the dispatch box.  It says that, while Mr Hancock \"largely had Tory backbench backing, there was an undercurrent of unease on his own side\".    Others speculate about how much longer Gavin Williamson might stay in his job.   For the Times's Quentin Letts , Mr Williamson seemed to anticipate imminent punishment, standing \"with shoulders hunched, as if expecting to be clanged over the head by a frying pan at any moment\".   The Daily Mail columnist, Henry Deedes, agrees  that \"his face bore the anxious look of a child outside the headmaster's study, awaiting an inevitable rollicking\".    Michael Deacon in the Daily Telegraph  believes Boris Johnson is biding his time. He predicts Mr Williamson will \"make the perfect ready-made scapegoat if the return to schools goes wrong\", rather than the prime minister having to sack a \"shiny new education secretary\".    That's a view shared by  the Guardian's John Crace , who sees Mr Williamson as the \"classic useful idiot\". He adds: \"Sack him now and there's no-one but Boris left to take the hit.\" New rules on Covid-19 etiquette -  drawn up by Tatler magazine  - are helpfully  reproduced in the Times , to allow readers to pass as upper class while maintaining proper social distancing.   Upper class members of society, it says, would turn up their noses at careless kissing, homemade face masks and hugging their parents - preferring instead separate bedrooms, holidaying in Britain and paying for a new hospital wing.

{"id":null,"body":"Hundreds of climate activists marched through Cardiff as part of Extinction Rebellion's latest protests in the city. Some activists scaled the roof of the Welsh secretary's office to hang banners, demanding action to cut greenhouse gases.   Police and the Welsh Government urged protestors to be vigilant to the threat of coronavirus.  Demonstrations are taking place across the UK this week. There have been at least  65 arrests . Extinction Rebellion said it was putting a focus on Cardiff because of its position as a coastal capital. Gwenllian Rees, 17, from Powys, said people had been advised to wear face masks and stewards walked in the march to ensure people were social distancing. She said: \"Imagine if before the Covid crisis there had been a mass campaign of people pushing government to prepare for a pandemic.  \"We would have been way more prepared.  \"This is essentially what we are doing now.\" Gwenni Jenkins-Jones, 23, from Cardiff, said: \"Although the focus is on Cardiff, this is a message to all leaders to do something. \"Here in Wales... we've got over a thousand miles of coastline so, if sea levels rise, you can only imagine how many communities are going to be affected by that.\" Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas said the city was investing in flood defences while also playing its part in trying to \"become carbon neutral\" after reducing emissions as a council by 49% in the last five years. \"We reckon we need to go further but we need to bring others,\" he said.  A Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"Achieving the radical changes needed to end Wales' contribution to global warming will require efforts from government at all levels as well as from businesses and communities.\" South Wales Police said officers were \"working to engage with protest organisers and attendees in order to remind them of their obligations under the current coronavirus legislation\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new UN report says the world needs to rapidly raise investment in early warning systems for extreme weather events. Over the past 50 years, recorded disasters have increased five-fold, thanks in part to climate change. The study warns that one in three people on Earth are not adequately covered by warning systems. The numbers of people in need after natural disasters could increase by 50% over the next decade.  The State of Climate Services 2020 has been produced by experts from 16 international agencies and financial institutions, and co-ordinated by the  World Meteorological Organization  (WMO). Over the past 50 years, it says, some 11,000 disasters involving weather, climate and water-related hazards have occurred claiming two million lives and causing more than $3.5 trillion in economic losses.  In 2018, around 108 million people sought help from international agencies to cope with natural disasters.  The authors of the new report say that by 2030 this number could increase by 50% at a cost of around $20bn a year. Effective early warning systems are key says the study - And the researchers who have compiled it are calling for a change in emphasis from simply forecasting what the weather will be, to showing the impact of that weather system.  Good quality warning systems are critically needed in the least developed countries and in small island states.  These countries have lost billions to weather and climate related disasters over the past five decades. Around 70% of the deaths connected to these disasters occurred in the poorest nations. Yet according to the WMO, just 26% of weather observation networks in Africa meet their standards.  The advent of the coronavirus has made the building of early warning systems more difficult, the report says. But it shouldn't distract from the need to help poorer people to cope with natural disasters, made worse by climate change. \"Being prepared and able to react at the right time, in the right place, can save many lives and protect the livelihoods of communities everywhere,\" said WMO secretary-general Prof Petteri Taalas. \"While Covid-19 generated a large international health and economic crisis from which it will take years to recover, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat to human lives, ecosystems, economies and societies for centuries to come,\" he said.  The report outlines six recommendations that the authors say are critical: \"Covid-19 has made risk everybody's business,\" said Mami Mizutori, who is the special representative of the UN secretary-general for disaster risk reduction. \"We need to carry this understanding and momentum into the much bigger fight for our planet against the larger, stronger, more devastating climate emergency.\" The report has been released on the  International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction .

{"id":null,"body":"Two gold nuggets worth around A$350,000 (\u00a3190,000; US$250,000) have been discovered by a pair of diggers in southern Australia. Brent Shannon and Ethan West found the nuggets near goldmining town Tarnagulla in Victoria state. Their lucky find was shown on TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, which aired on Thursday. The men dug up the ground and used metal detectors to detect gold in the area. \"These are definitely one of the most significant finds,\" Ethan West said, according to CNN. \"To have two large chunks in one day is quite amazing.\" They found the nuggets, which have a combined weight of 3.5kg (7.7lb), in a number of hours with the help of Mr West's father, according to the Discovery Channel which airs the programme. The show, which is also broadcast in the UK, follows teams of gold prospectors who dig in goldfields in remote parts of Australia. \"I reckoned we were in for a chance,\" Mr Shannon told Australian TV show Sunrise. \"It was in a bit of virgin ground, which means it's untouched and hasn't been mined.\"  Mr West said that during four years of mining for gold, he is picked up \"probably thousands\" of pieces. The Discovery Channel also said collectors could pay up to 30% more for the nuggets than their estimated value. In 2019  an Australian man unearthed a 1.4kg (49oz) gold nugget  worth an estimated A$100,000 (\u00a354,000; $69,000) using a metal detector. Gold mining in Australia began in the 1850s, and remains a significant industry in the country. The town of Tarnagulla itself was founded during the Victoria Gold Rush and became very wealthy for a period of time when keen prospectors moved there to make their fortune,  according to a local website.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Madrid This video can not be played The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a \"fight to the death\" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances.  Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks.  The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases  trap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: \"Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides.  As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week.\" She added: \"It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee.  But we also refuse to die.\" Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. \"We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement,\" she said. \"In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         \"With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide.\"   The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, \"the point of no return is no longer over the horizon\".  Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. This video can not be played \"In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. \"We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,\" Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020.  This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them.  The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers.  Last month, he  began the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal . However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. \"While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action,\" said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity.  \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA \"America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share.\" Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls \"climate shocks\" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa.  The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart.  This video can not be played Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last March, while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding. \"The climate crisis is happening here, and it's killing people, forcing them from their homes and ruining children's chance of a future,\" said Ian Vale from Save the Children.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The signs and impacts of global warming are speeding up, the latest science on climate change, published ahead of key UN talks in New York, says. The data, compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), says the five-year period from 2014 to 2019 is the warmest on record.  Sea-level rise has accelerated significantly over the same period, as CO2 emissions have hit new highs. The WMO says carbon-cutting efforts have to be intensified immediately. The climate statement is a pull-together of the latest science on the causes and growing impacts of unprecedented levels of warming seen in recent years.  Recognising that global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees C since 1850, the paper notes they have gone up by 0.2C between 2011 and 2015. This video can not be played This is as a result of burgeoning emissions of carbon, with the amount of the gas going into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2019 growing by 20% compared with the previous five years.  Perhaps most worrying of all is the data on sea-level rise.  The average rate of rise since 1993 until now is 3.2mm per year. However, from May 2014 to 2019 the rise has increased to 5mm per year. The 10-year period from 2007-2016 saw an average of about 4mm per year.  \"Sea-level rise has accelerated and we are concerned that an abrupt decline in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which will exacerbate future rise,\" said WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas. \"As we have seen this year with tragic effect in the Bahamas and Mozambique, sea-level rise and intense tropical storms led to humanitarian and economic catastrophes.\"  The report also highlights the threats to the oceans, with more than 90% of the excess heat caused by climate change ending up in the waters. The WMO analysis says 2018 had the highest ocean heat content values on record.  This video can not be played The study underlines the fact that wherever you look on the planet right now, the story is the same: human-induced warming is impacting the scale and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and wildfires.  \"Climate change due to us is accelerating and on a very dangerous course,\" said Prof Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and professor of meteorology, University of Reading. \"We should listen to the loud cry coming from the schoolchildren. There is an emergency - one for action in both rapidly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions towards zero and adapting to the inevitable changes in climate.\" The WMO report is meant to inform the special UN summit on climate change taking place in New York on Monday. A range of political leaders will attend the one-day event, which is designed to be about action and not words, according to UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.  \"I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,\" he said ahead of the meeting.  \"People want solutions, commitments and action. I expect there will be an announcement and unveiling of a number of meaningful plans on dramatically reducing emissions during the next decade, and on reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\" Greta Thunberg and other youth activists, fresh from marching on the streets of New York on Friday, will speak at the opening of the meeting. About 60 heads of state are expected to follow, with countries expected to announce new actions to limit the causes of warming or to speak on initiatives developed by a coalition of nations.  While China, India, France, Germany and the UK will speak at the meeting, there is no place on the podium for Japan or Australia.  Mr Guterres has asked that as well as committing to net-zero emissions by 2050, countries should reduce subsidies for fossil fuels and stop building new coal-fired power stations. The question of coal has led to the barring of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australia's Scott Morrison. The US, Brazil and Saudi Arabia will also not be taking part. The success of the special summit remains in the balance - what isn't in question is the urgency of action and the fact that delay means more difficult decisions down the line.  \"It is highly important that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, notably from energy production, industry and transport. This is critical if we are to mitigate climate change and meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement,\" said Petteri Taalas from the WMO. \"To stop a global temperature increase of more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, the level of ambition needs to be tripled. And to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, it needs to be multiplied by five,\" he said. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Jessica Murphy BBC News, Montreal For the first time in more than a decade, climate change is at the forefront of a federal election campaign in Canada. Can Justin Trudeau again win the heart of environmentally minded voters?  Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg had words for Liberal leader Justin Trudeau: - the Canadian Prime Minister is \"obviously not doing enough\" on climate change.  The 16-year-old schoolgirl has earned a reputation for speaking truth to power - but Mr Trudeau nonetheless chose to meet her on Friday before she led the climate strike march in Montreal. \"I agree with her entirely,\" said Mr Trudeau later. \" We need to do more.\" The Liberal leader has been laying out increasingly ambitious climate policies this week on the federal campaign trail - though they lacked key details on how they would be achieved -  from a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to a vow to plant two billion trees over the next decade.  It's not the first time Ms Thunberg expressed frustration at Canada's climate policies.  In June, parliamentarians passed a motion put forward by the Liberal environment minister declaring a national climate emergency.  The next day, the Liberal government approved the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.  On Twitter, Ms Thunberg called it \"shameful\".  One second they declare a  #ClimateEmergency  and the next second they say yes to expand a pipeline. This is shameful. But of course this is not only in Canada, we can unfortunately see the same pattern everywhere... https:\/\/t.co\/zVbWXnLBSQ On the campaign trail, his political opponents also weighed in on Mr Trudeau's environmental record.  \"Justin Trudeau is protesting his own government's record of failure,\" retorted Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, referring to the Liberal leader's participation in the Montreal climate march.  The Green Party dismissed the new Liberal goals as \"greenwashing\".  Mr Trudeau says if re-elected on 21 October, his government \"will not only meet our 2030 targets, but exceed them\".  This federal election is the first in over a decade in Canada where climate has been at the forefront -  and it's taking place amid renewed international pressure on world leaders to act.  Canadians are anxious about climate change  - an effect seen across regions, ages and genders.  S\u00e9bastien Jodoin is a professor at Montreal's McGill University, whose research focuses on looking at social and legal solutions to complex problems like climate change.  He says he thinks Canadians have \"changed their minds\" on climate over the last few years due to a  growing awareness of the severe weather predicted to accompany rising temperatures.  In Quebec, large scale flooding in recent years has hammered the message home. The province is currently working on new rules for construction in areas prone to inundation.  Other Canadian provinces are seeing costs related to extreme weather events balloon. Alberta had two of the most costly disasters in Canada's history in recent years - the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires and major floods in 2013.  But climate and energy issues have been driving a wedge between provinces in recent years.  Quebecers are among the most environmentally-minded Canadians. The province also has lower per capita emissions than other provinces, mainly due to its vast hydro power reserves.  British Columbia - especially the coastal regions of the province - also has a strong green bent.  Both provinces strongly oppose oil pipeline project within their own jurisdiction, putting them at odds with land-locked, oil-producing Alberta.  University student and climate marcher Nina Blancas, 20, told the BBC in Montreal that she wanted political leaders who would move Canada away from its dependence on energy intensive natural resources. \"Invest in innovation, invest in change,\" she said.   Canada is the fourth largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.   Most of those reserves are in Alberta's oil sands, which account for 11% of Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions  and 0.1% of global emissions - as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in government revenue.  Oil producers and analysts say increased pipeline capacity is necessary to boost the industry, allowing it to export its product to globally and to command higher prices.  Albertan Miles Matulinios told the BBC in Calgary that both the environment and the economy need to be considered by policy makers.  \"Canada's strength is natural resources, so the most important thing is we can't just ignore that,\" he said. \"People still need to eat and live, so I think it has to be a balance.\"  Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy, a Quebec college professor and one of the activists behind the Montreal strike, says one of their top demands is for climate laws to be put in place that would force governments to reach their emissions targets.  \"Once we have that, we can have a discussion together about how we want to achieve these goals,\" he said. \"But these goals should not be optional, they should be mandatory. That's what the science says that we need to achieve.\"  Canada's emissions are currently higher than they were in 1990, though down slightly from levels seen in the early 2000s.  \"We don't have time for empty promises anymore,\" says Mr Geoffroy. \"The time for speeches is over.\"  Canada - a country of 37 million people - is among the world's top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases as well as one of the world's largest per capita emitters.   Mr Jodoin said Liberal governments in Canada from the 1990s to the early 21st century made grand commitments on climate action but with few real results.  And under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who governed from 2006 to 2015, Canada formally abandoned the Kyoto protocol, a legally binding international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Harper was critical the deal failed to include the US and China, the world's largest emitters.  Despite the withdrawal Canada continued to participate in global climate talks, though it was frequently criticised as being an uncooperative participant.  Canada is currently not on track to meet its Paris Agreement targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.  According to the Climate Action Tracker, Canada's efforts are \"insufficient\" and \"not consistent with holding warming to below 2\u00b0C, let alone limiting it to 1.5\u00b0C as required under the Paris Agreement\".  Analysts have said Mr Trudeau's main climate policy - a national carbon tax imposed on provinces without an equivalent plan already in place - is capped too low, at C$50 ($38; \u00a330) by 2020, to ensure Canada meets its targets.  \"If we just go with their current policies, they're inadequate,\" said Mr Jodoin.   Mr Trudeau's federal Liberals also took the rare step last year of buying the Alberta-to-BC Trans Mountain oil pipeline for C$4.5bn ($3.4bn; \u00a32.6bn) to help ensure a project to expand its capacity goes ahead.  While there has been daylight  between Mr Trudeau's promises and his policy,  Mr Jodoin did say \"the measures [the Liberals have] taken -  they're the most ambitious we've seen in Canada\".  He calls the Conservative plan, which would cancel Mr Trudeau's carbon tax and focus on the innovation and export of green tech innovation as \"more a shield than a sword - they just don't want to be seen that they're doing nothing\".  Mr Jodoin says he is cheered by the fact that climate has become a high-profile political issue, but is still skeptical that it will truly be a deciding factor for many voters.  \"I'm not sure how many people are really voting on this specific issue and assessing the climate science,\" he said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst This video can not be played Climate change can't be halted if we carry on degrading the soil, a report will say. There's three times more carbon in the soil than in the atmosphere \u2013 but that carbon's being released by deforestation and poor farming. This is fuelling climate change \u2013 and compromising our attempts to feed a growing world population, the authors will say. Problems include soils being eroded, compacted by machinery, built over, or harmed by over-watering. Hurting the soil affects the climate in two ways: it compromises the growth of plants taking in carbon from the atmosphere, and it releases soil carbon previously stored by worms taking leaf matter underground. The warning will come from the awkwardly-named IPBES \u2013 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services - a panel studying the benefits of nature to humans. The body, which is meeting this week, aims to get all the world\u2019s governments singing from the same sheet about the need to protect natural systems. IPBES will formally release its report on Monday 6 May. About 3.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from degraded soils, said IPBES chairman Prof Sir Bob Watson. \"That's almost half of the world population. There\u2019s no question we are degrading soils all over the world. We are losing from the soil the organic carbon and this undermines agricultural productivity and contributes to climate change. We absolutely have to restore the degraded soil we\u2019ve got.\" Prof Watson previously led the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \"Governments have focused on climate change far more than they have focused on loss of biodiversity or land degradation. All three are equally important to human wellbeing.\" Soil expert Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University, UK, added: \"The thin layer of soil covering the Earth's surface represents the difference between survival and extinction for most terrestrial life. \"Only 3% of the planet's surface is suitable for arable production and 75 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to land degradation every year.\" She said soils form at a rate of  1cm in 300 years. There's uncertainty about the exact level of global soil degradation. But the major hotspots are reported to be in South America, where forests are being felled; sub-Saharan Africa; India and China. Soil scientists in both the biggest Asian nations are worried that their ability to grow their own food may be compromised. In the US, some soils are being restored as forests take over poor quality land previously worked by small farmers, but others are still being degraded. The UK is not immune either. Some maize fields in south-west England suffer major soil loss with heavy rainfall because growing maize leaves bare soil exposed. Heavy rain is more likely under climate change. Erosion is also a long-standing issue in the fertile Fens, where, on dry windy days, peaty soil particles sometimes form a kind of smog called the \"Fen Blow\".  Peat has a high carbon content \u2013 and a recent paper suggests there\u2019s far more carbon being lost from peatlands than previously thought. And on the chalky hills of southern England, chemical-intensive crop farming is said to have caused the loss of over a foot of soil in some places. Soils are \"incredibly important\" for our well-being, said Dr Joanna Clark from Reading University. \"We all know that crops are grown in soil, but soils are important for climate change as well. There's three times more carbon stored in soil than there is in the atmosphere. So imagine if all that carbon was released, we\u2019d get runaway climate change. So we need to keep the carbon in the soil.\" The simplest way to protect soils while combating climate change is to let forests grow back. This option is favoured by fans of re-wilding. But some farmers believe they can continue to produce food by changing the way they farm to enhance the soil. Brexit could give the UK greater flexibility on how to spend public money on farming - enabling much more leeway to reward farmers for capturing carbon in the earth. But there are more than 700 soil types in the UK alone, so it won\u2019t be simple.

{"id":null,"body":"Celebrity Extinction Rebellion supporters have admitted in an open letter being \"hypocrites\" over their high-carbon lifestyles. But stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, who last week joined London protests, called for \"systemic change\" to the \"fossil-fuel economy\". It comes as Extinction Rebellion was granted permission to challenge a London-wide protest ban in court. Several demonstrators have been arrested as hundreds defied the ban. More than 100 celebrity supporters of Extinction Rebellion signed  the letter to the media , which urges the media to focus on \"the real story\" of the climate and ecological emergency. Spice Girl Mel B, comedian Steve Coogan, musician Bob Geldof, actor Sir Mark Rylance, model Lily Cole and Glastonbury's Emily Eavis, among others, all confessed their culpability in the climate crisis. The letter says: \"Dear journalists who have called us hypocrites. You're right. \"We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints. \"Like you, and everyone else, we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm.\" But they called on the media to focus on the \"more urgent story\" of life on earth  dying in a sixth mass extinction . They said they cannot ignore the call of young people such as Greta Thunberg to \"fight for their already devastated future\", even if it means putting themselves \"in your firing line\". Meanwhile, the  prime minister is to chair a new cabinet committee on climate change  to drive action to cut emissions across the government. Green groups have been calling for such top-level co-ordination - although they remain critical of other policy details. It comes as police have begun making arrests after Extinction Rebellion activists defied an order banning them from demonstrating anywhere in London. About 500 protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, some of whom covered their mouths with black tape to symbolise the silencing of their protest. Within a couple of hours, the protest broke up and large numbers dispersed. Police arrested a small group who were blocking Whitehall, BBC correspondent Andy Moore said. Among those arrested were Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley and George Monbiot, the author and Guardian journalist. As he was arrested, Mr Monbiot said: \"We have to make a stand against the destruction of our life support systems.\" An application for a judicial review of the ban was accepted by the High Court, according to an Extinction Rebellion spokesman. It means the case can go ahead, with an initial hearing scheduled for Thursday. The claimants include the Green Party's Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jenny Jones, Labour MPs Clive Lewis and David Drew, and Mr Monbiot. Extinction Rebellion argues the ban is disproportionate and an unprecedented curtailment of the right to free speech and free assembly. The group hopes the High Court will quash the decision to implement the blanket ban. It follows the Metropolitan Police announcing  new restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act , which required protesters to disperse by 21:00 BST or risk arrest. Any assembly of more than two people linked to the Extinction Rebellion action is now illegal in London. The force said it decided to impose the rules after \"continued breaches\" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square. More than 1,600 people have been arrested since the protests, dubbed the Autumn Uprising, began on October 7. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, said he was confident the Met's decision was \"entirely lawful\" and \"entirely proportionate\". Also on Wednesday, a group of mothers and babies defied the restriction, staging a \"feed-in\" outside Google's offices in London's King's Cross, while other activists targeted the nearby offices of YouTube - a Google subsidiary. They said they wanted to highlight the company's political donations to organisations that have campaigned against action on climate change. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said concerns had been raised about the police's decision to ban the protests, adding that shadow home secretary Diane Abbott was discussing it with the police. \"I think it's important to protect the right of free speech, and the right to demonstrate in our society - obviously in a non-violent way,\" he said. He added that Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan had no involvement in the \"operational decision\" by police to remove the protesters. On Tuesday, Mr Khan said he was \"seeking further information\" about why the ban was necessary, saying he believed \"the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld\". A government spokesman said the UK was already taking \"world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050\". \"While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives,\" he added. Police have the powers to ban a protest under the  Public Order Act 1986 , if a senior officer has reasonable belief that it may cause \"serious disruption to the life of the community\". Police are also under a duty to balance the task of keeping the streets open with the right freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the  Human Rights Act 1998  and freedom of expression, under Article 10. These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them. However, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: \"The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary.\" By law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance. Police have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions. A Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News This video can not be played High-tech tracking collars on nine female polar bears have measured the animals' efforts to find food on the diminishing Arctic ice. Each bear wore a collar - recording video, location and activity levels - for 8-12 days, while metabolic tracers tracked the bears' energy use. This revealed that most of the animals were unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs. The team says wild bears have higher metabolic rates than thought.  Moreover, climate change appears to be having dramatic effects on the Arctic sea-ice, forcing polar bears to move greater distances as they hunt, and making it harder for them to catch prey. The vision of a polar bear plucking a vulnerable seal off an ice floe is something familiar to wildlife documentary fanatics. Earlier this winter, though,  an image of an emaciated polar bear went viral,  with many asking if this was the telltale image of climate change.  The authors of this study,  published in the journal Science , point out that the animals do now need to travel further to find seals, and that this is likely to be an \"important factor explaining declines in their body condition and survival\" of polar bears. In Spring of 2014, 2015, and 2016, Anthony Pagano, a researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz and his colleagues, set out to track the polar bears' hunting and survival during this critical season. They captured nine females on the sea-ice of the Beaufort Sea and measured the metabolic rates of each bear using blood and urine samples.  They also fitted the bear with the GPS-camera collars, to record and film their activity.  \"We found that polar bears actually have much higher energy demands than predicted. They need to be catching a lot of seals,\" Mr Pagano explained.  The extent of Arctic sea-ice, as measured at its minimum in September, is decreasing at a rate of about 14% per decade, which is likely reducing polar bears' access to seals. And their plight could be exacerbated by the need to alter hunting strategies with the seasons.  In the spring, the researchers explained polar bears are mostly preying on juvenile seals. But later in the year, after the bears' long summer fast, those young seals are older and wiser, meaning polar bears are not able to catch as many.  \"It's thought that bears might catch a couple per month in the fall, compared to five to 10 per month in the spring and early summer,\" Mr Pagano said. \"We now have the technology to learn how they are moving on the ice, their activity patterns, and their energy needs, so we can better understand the implications of these changes we are seeing in the sea-ice.\" Follow Victoria on Twitter Polar bears travel further on ice The 'face of climate change'?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Ireland stands on the brink of putting climate change at the heart of its government if Green Party members vote in favour of a new coalition. The new administration plans to ban fracked gas imports from the US, make steep cuts in emissions and end new drilling for oil and gas. Agreed in talks with two larger parties, the plan now needs the support of two thirds of Green members. But there is opposition, with some saying it is not progressive enough. The results of voting are expected on Friday evening. Ireland's reputation as a clean and green country has been tarnished in recent years by the inability of successive governments to tackle carbon emissions. Compared to the rest of the EU, Ireland is the  fourth largest emitter per capita .  An agreed EU target to cut carbon by 20% by this year was  missed by a country mile .  The main problems have been in transport and agriculture, with a growing national dairy herd increasing by more than a quarter in the past five years.  Voter concern over climate change saw a significant improvement in Green Party representation in parliamentary elections held in February this year. With no one  winning an overall majority , the Greens' 12 seats made them a key partner in coalition talks, with  the two largest traditional parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael . Delayed by the Covid-19 crisis, negotiators eventually produced an agreed  programme for government . The issues of climate change and sustainability are at the heart of it.  The proposed cuts in emissions will be enshrined in a Climate Action law, which will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set.  This idea, which would see Ireland's emissions cut by 51% by 2030, is similar to existing legislation in the UK, and has been welcomed by scientists.  \"The achievement of the 7% annual cut in emissions would be a scientifically acceptable solution at least in the short- and medium-term for Ireland, given that we have been flatlining our emissions and failing to meet the targets we have signed up to,\" said John Sweeney, emeritus professor of geography at Maynooth University. \"It has a very strong influence if you embrace the carbon budget principle. And I think that's what will drive the achievement of reductions here so I am quite happy from a scientific point of view.\" As well as banning the importation of fracked gas from US shale production, the programme would stall any future oil and gas drilling in Irish waters.  The programme is likely to be approved by members of the two bigger parties - but the Greens' high bar of two thirds support makes the whole project uncertain.  Some experts believe that failure to support the deal would be a calamity, as the programme, they argue, would usher in the greenest government in the history of the state. \"It's completely transformational,\" said John Gibbons, an Irish journalist and long time climate commentator. \"What this delivers is a quantum shift in Ireland's climate response. A ban on fracked gas is incredibly important, as is the ban on oil and gas exploration, this is saying to the multinational fossil fuel industry, Ireland is now off limits.\" Despite the potential gains, within the Green movement there is considerable opposition from members who feel that it doesn't address issues of social justice, housing and economic strategy. \"There's a new generation of activists that believe in climate justice and they don't feel that you can separate issues around housing, issues around finance, issues around taxation from environmental concerns,\" said Neasa Hourigan, who is a new Green party TD (Member of Parliament). While she helped negotiate the programme for government, she is now urging members to reject it. \"Until you address everything in terms of the fabric of how we operate as a society, then really what you're doing is just compartmentalising something into one area and that's not going to effect real climate action,\" she told BBC News. \"It has to be system change instead of climate change.\" With opposition from young people and members of the party in Northern Ireland, Green leaders have turned to Hollywood,  enlisting actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo to  encourage members to back the deal . With the result said to be down to a handful of votes, there are worries that opponents of the programme based in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland may scupper a plan that won't directly impact them.  Some commentators are urging Green members to keep their eye on the bigger picture. \"In a climate emergency when your house is on fire, you deal with the emergency and then when that's stabilised we'll get onto all the other good stuff,\" said John Gibbons. \"This is the best chance, it's out of sight in terms of anything that's ever been on the table.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helier Cheung BBC News, Washington DC US President Donald Trump's position on climate change has been in the spotlight again, after he criticised \"prophets of doom\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At the event, which had sustainability as its main theme, and activist Greta Thunberg as its star guest, Mr Trump dismissed \"alarmists\" who wanted to \"control every aspect of our lives\" - while also expressing the US's support for an initiative to plant one trillion trees.  If you judge the president based on his words alone, his views on climate change appear contradictory - and confusing. He has called climate change \"mythical\", \"nonexistent\", or \"an expensive hoax\" - but also subsequently described it as a \"serious subject\" that is \"very important to me\". Still - if you sift through his multitude of tweets and statements, a number of themes emerge.  In 2009, Mr Trump actually signed  a full-page advert in the New York Times , along with dozens of other business leaders, expressing support for legislation combating climate change. \"If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet,\" the statement said. But in the years that followed, he took an opposite approach on Twitter, with more than 120 posts questioning or making light of climate change. In 2012, he famously said climate change was \"created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive\" - something he later claimed was a joke. He regularly repeated claims that scientists had rebranded global warming as climate change because \"the name global warming wasn't working\" (in fact, both terms are used, but  experts at Nasa have argued  that climate change is the more scientifically accurate term). And he also has dozens of tweets suggesting that cold weather disproves climate change - despite the World Meteorological Organization saying that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA (If you can't see this chart tap or click  here )  He has tweeted less about climate change in recent years - and, since being elected president, he has adopted an ambiguous, inconsistent stance in interviews and speeches.  But even when he acknowledges the significance of climate change, he tends to frame it in terms of clean air and water (which are not directly related to climate change), or the cost to business: Commentators have suggested  that Mr Trump tends to conflate climate change with environmentalism more generally.  \"He doesn't really understand what climate change is about,\" says Professor Michael Gerrard, an environmental law professor at the University of Columbia.   This video can not be played Meanwhile, Joseph Goffman, executive director of Harvard's Environmental Law Programme, argues that Mr Trump \"believes nothing on climate change - he's a climate nihilist\". Mr Trump's position is based on his need to appeal to \"the part of the Republican establishment that rejects climate policy,\" Mr Goffman, who previously worked as Democratic staff director on the Senate environmental committee, adds.  Joseph Pinion, a  Republican strategist who has called for more action on climate change , also argues that Mr Trump looks at the issue from a political, rather than a moral perspective. \"He's not going to win running on the environment,\" Mr Pinion says. \"In America, climate is not an issue, so the reason it is not an issue for President Trump is because he cares about winning. And the reason Democrats are OK with it not being a priority for them, is because they want to beat him.\" \"Ultimately it doesn't matter what President Trump believes, what matters is what he's doing - we need to recognise climate change is not a priority of his administration.\" The  Climate Deregulation Tracker , run by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, has documented more than 130 steps the Trump administration has taken to scale back measures to fight climate change. High-profile rollbacks include: \"He's completely halted and reversed the momentum that was built up during the Obama administration in fighting climate change,\" Prof Gerrard says.  While withdrawing from the Paris Agreement was \"terrible symbolically\", the agreement had \"virtually no specifics on what the US had to do\", so other rollbacks, especially the attempt to limit fuel economic standards of cars, were more damaging, he adds. This video can not be played Dan Costa worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years, including as the National Director of the Air, Climate & Energy Research Program. He said he noticed an \"anti-science stance\" once the Trump administration's team took over.  \"One of the folks who came as part of the transition team said 'if climate change is such a bad thing, why are so many people moving to Arizona? Anyway, you can turn up the air conditioning.'\" He noticed that budget documents from the president's office and Congress began to refer to his Air, Climate & Energy Research Program (ACE) as the Air and Energy research programme instead. \"There was a fair amount of anxiety and self censorship... people would start to keep the word 'climate' out of titles,\" he said, adding that he also noticed a policy of \"benign neglect\" where many employees were not replaced after they left. In 2018, Mr Trump made headlines after he cast doubt on the government's own National Climate Assessment. When asked about the findings that climate change would have a devastating economic impact, Mr Trump said: \" I don't believe it .\" Prof Costa said some in the EPA responded with \"derisive laughter\" when they heard this. \"Everybody knows that what he says doesn't necessarily reflect what he really thinks.\" The Trump administration's actions have widely rolled back on climate change measures. But some have seen a recent shift in his tone, as he has described himself as \"an environmentalist\" several times in the past few months.  \"We've seen him really soften his rhetoric on the issue of climate change. He's no longer talking about it being a hoax, and he's talking about his care for the environment,\" says Quillan Robinson, government affairs director at the American Conservation Coalition. His group is led by young Republicans who want more to be done on the environment - and he argues that, while Mr Trump often talks about climate change in more general environmental terms, it was still a \"promising sign\". \"We would like him to come out and talk about where the scientific consensus is at... at the same time, talking about it in terms of clean air and water appeals to broader factions of the country, so it's something people can get behind.\" Not everyone agrees there is a shift in Mr Trump's rhetoric - Prof Gerrard argues that it is \"sporadic, and not substantive... the administration continues to go all out on repealing regulations\". But if Mr Trump does change his tone - or his actions - on climate change in the future, it is likely to be for political reasons.  A Pew survey last year  found that 52% of young Republicans felt the government was doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, while  a Monmouth University poll  found that almost two thirds of Republicans now believe in climate change - a 15% increase from just three years ago.  A survey commissioned by the American Conservative Coalition  suggested that 67% of millennial Republican voters believed the party should do more on climate change.  \"The trajectory of the GOP of old consider climate change a hoax, but the future of the GOP is comprised of individuals who take the issue just as seriously as Democrats,\" says Mr Pinion.  \"You can find ways to win elections by slimmer and slimmer margins, but we are quickly arriving at the day when a party that does not have solutions on climate change is not going to be viable with the overall majority of the electorate.\"  'Not a time for pessimism' - Trump 'Net zero?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Incheon, South Korea This video can not be played It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures.  Their  dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C  says the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".   It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open.  After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards.  Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear.  Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger \"The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,\" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. \"The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation.\" \"Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. \"And they have.\" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable.  Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature \"guard rail\" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030.  We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades.  Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever. This video can not be played The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair.  \"That's a very empowering message for the individual,\" she said. \"This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved.\"  \"You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use.  \"We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport.\" \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve \"annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion\" between 2016 and 2035.  Experts believe this number needs to be put in context.  \"There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. \"The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.\" \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming.  Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding.  There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.  \"We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. \"Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire.\"  Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close.  By the same token, the report's \"pathways\" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets.  Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees.  But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific.  \"If you save a small island country, then you save the world,\" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. \"Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity.\" Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road.  \"They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,\" said Prof Jim Skea.  \"If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face.\" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. \"This is the moment where we need to decide\" said Kaisa Kosonen. \"We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent We're living through the biggest carbon crash ever recorded. No war, no recession, no previous pandemic has had such a dramatic impact on emissions of CO2 over the past century as Covid-19 has in a few short months. Multiple sources indicate we are now living through an unrivalled drop in carbon output. But even though we will see a massive fall this year, the concentrations of CO2 that are in the atmosphere and warming our planet won't stabilise until the world reaches net-zero. As our chart shows, since the Spanish flu killed millions over 100 years ago, the global expansion of emissions of CO2, from the use of oil, gas and coal has risen massively. While these energy sources have transformed the world, the carbon seeping into our atmosphere has driven up global temperatures by just over 1C since the mid-1850s.  They could rise by 3-4C by the end of this century if CO2 levels aren't savagely reduced.  Over the past 100 years, as indicated on the graphic, a number of events have shown that dramatic falls in carbon are possible.  Much is made of the financial crash in 2008-2009, but in reality, carbon emissions only fell by around 450 million tonnes between 2008 and 2009. This is much smaller than the fall in CO2 in the aftermath of World War II, which saw a drop of around 800 million tonnes.  This video can not be played It is also smaller than the global recession in the early 1980s that followed the oil crisis of the late 1970s.  During this period, CO2 went down by around one billion tonnes. But the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 dwarves all of these previous shocks by some distance. In a few months, demand for energy globally has fallen off a cliff.  The International Energy Agency (IEA)  says that the world will use 6% less this year  - equivalent to losing the entire energy demand of India. This will feed through to large falls in CO2.  A number of different analyses,  including this one from Carbon Brief , show that emissions this year will fall by 4-8%, somewhere between 2 and 3 billion tonnes of the warming gas.  That's between six and ten times larger than during the last global recession. By air and on roads, the world has cut back heavily on travel. Full lockdowns have also pushed global electricity demand down by 20% or more, says the IEA. Across the full year, the need for electricity will fall by 5% - the biggest drop since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  \"This is an historic shock to the entire energy world,\" says Dr Fatih Birol, IEA executive director.  The changes in energy demand will have a knock-on effect on global coal demand, which is set to fall 8% this year.   With China the first country to stall its economy in response to the virus, coal use dropped sharply at first, though it is now rebounding and the expectation among energy analysts is that production this year will be down by just over 1%. Researchers say the biggest thing hitting CO2 emissions right now is the reduction in road transport. According to the IEA global average road transport activity fell to 50% of the 2019 level by the end of March 2020.  As can be seen in our chart, almost every country has seen a huge drop in road use. This has resulted in a massive fall in the use of oil. \"Back in the 2009 recession, average oil demand dropped by 1.3 million barrels per day versus 2008. And now 2020 is set to average 10 million barrels per day less than 2019.\" said Erik Holm Reiso, from Rystad Energy, an independent research firm. \"It's a much more severe cycle.\" Similarly, air travel has dropped hugely, but by different amounts in different regions.  In Europe, the number of flights is down around 90%, whereas in the US it has been more resilient with around half the number of planes taking off compared to last year. Globally, though, the demand for jet fuel is down 65% year-on-year to April.  \"What we're seeing is that the largest relative reduction is in air traffic,\" said Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (Cicero). \"But air emissions are only about 3% of global total. So while the relative reductions in land transport are lower than air transport, the absolute reductions there are much more significant.\" While the lockdown might feel rather uniform across the world, there have been huge variations in emissions reductions from different cities. If we take Paris and New York as examples, the contrast, as shown on our chart, is huge.  Paris saw a CO2 drop of 72% (+\/-15%) in the month of March compared to normal. New York in the same period, saw a CO2 fall of around 10%.  So why the big difference?  \"In the Paris area, there are no large fossil fuel power plants, or industrial sites,\" said Philippe Ciais, from the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace in Paris. \"Another difference is whether buildings are heated with fuels or with electricity. In France, around 70% of electricity comes from nuclear.\" Much of New York's CO2 comes from emissions related to the heating of buildings. But significant emissions come from fossil fuel plants based within the city limits. Cars make up a much smaller proportion of overall energy use. \"I guess something to think about is that we shut down the entire city and got a reduction of 10% in the CO2 emissions,\" said Prof R\u00f3is\u00edn Commane from Columbia University in New York. \"We are still emitting more than 80% of our previous CO2 emissions. That is a massive number. So personal behaviour really isn't going to fix the carbon emission problem. We need a systematic change in how energy is generated and transmitted.\" This video can not be played Back in 2008, the European electricity industry was hit badly by the global financial recession and demand for power fell sharply.  But when that demand picked up again, it was solar and wind that were by then large enough to supply all the growth.  Europe's use of fossil fuels to produce electricity never returned to the level it had been at before the crash. Experts now believe something similar could happen with the coronavirus pandemic. \"In about half of the world, we've already seen peak demand for fossil fuels,\" said Kingsmill Bond, from independent financial think tank Carbon Tracker. \"In Europe it was 2005, in the USA 2007.\" This means that the trend in demand has been downhill ever since. He added: \"There has been a global coal demand peak in 2013. If you look at car demand, it is increasingly accepted that you saw peak conventional car demand in 2017.\" So will the pandemic's big hit on carbon mean that last year, 2019, becomes the year the world reached a turning point? Not so fast.  The carbon emissions drop that followed the recession in 2009  was followed by a sharp rise  of almost 6% in 2010. Something similar could happen over the next couple of years.  \"At this point, we do not see any clear signs that the pandemic and our societal response to it will lead to significant and permanent changes in the path of future global emissions,\" said Robbie Andrew from Cicero. \"Right at the moment what we're seeing are immediate emissions responses, and following most previous crises, global emissions have returned to their pre-crisis trajectory.\" To keep the world on track to stay under 1.5C this century, the world needs similar cuts for the foreseeable future to keep this target in view.  \"If Covid-19 leads to a drop in emissions of around 5% in 2020, then that is the sort of reduction we need every year until net-zero emissions are reached around 2050,\" said Glen Peters, also from Cicero. \"Such emissions reductions will not happen via lockdowns and restrictions, but by climate policies that lead to the deployment of clean technologies and reductions in demand for energy.\" Energy experts believe there will be a bounce back next year, but that, long term, the world will move to greener fuels. But it may not be enough to keep temperatures down to safer levels.  \"That downward slope will accelerate over time beyond peak fossil energy,\" said Erik Holm Reiso, from Rystad Energy. \"That doesn't chime with 1.5C, but maybe 1.8-1.9C degrees could be within reach and this situation right now could help achieve that, I think.\" Lessons learnt? Many climate researchers are optimistic that this deadly pandemic has taught governments some critical lessons that they can apply to the problem of rising temperatures.  The big challenge is to ensure the recovery has a green focus. According to Prof Gail Whiteman from Lancaster University, UK, it was almost impossible to believe that governments around the world, when faced with a health emergency, would put humanity ahead of the economy. But they did. \"We can recover from an existential, complex threat and emerge much stronger and more resilient,\" she says.  \"Which strengthens the idea that we can do things differently on climate, that we can tackle this one.  \"I think it gives us huge energy.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"id":null,"body":"EU leaders have agreed on a more ambitious goal for cutting greenhouse gases - reducing them by 55% by 2030, rather than 40%.  The new target was reached after difficult all-night talks in Brussels.  Poland, heavily reliant on coal, won a pledge of EU funding to help it transition to clean energy. The EU Commission will draw up detailed plans for all 27 member states to contribute to the 55% target, measured against 1990 CO2 emission levels. EU Council President Charles Michel hailed the agreement, tweeting \"Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change\". It is part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C. Environmental campaign groups say the 55% target does not go far enough. And the European Parliament, yet to debate the new target, has called for a 60% cut. Sebastian Mang of Greenpeace said \"the evidence shows that this deal is only a small improvement on the emission cuts the EU is already expected to achieve\". Greenpeace is urging a minimum cut of 65% in EU carbon emissions. That figure was also advocated by Johannes Wahlm\u00fcller of Austrian green group Global 2000.  There are two key questions about this new target for 2030: is it significant and is it enough?  It is undoubtedly a major step forward for the EU, the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. It puts the Union on track to reach a net-zero emissions goal by 2050. The fact that they have been able to bring the more reluctant countries like Poland along is also a positive.  But is it sufficient to satisfy the science and to avoid dangerous levels of warming? That's more debatable. Many green groups and the European Parliament argue that the EU should have gone much further to 65-70% if they really are serious about keeping the rise in temperatures under 1.5C this century.  The announcement is hugely timely, coming just a day before the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement. And right now, thanks to China and the new incoming US administration, there is a great deal of positive news on climate change. This EU decision certainly adds weight to that momentum. The UK government plans to slash UK emissions by 68% over the next decade. Meanwhile, Australia has said it will achieve its 2030 emissions pledge, made under the Paris deal, without resorting to using old carbon credits. Australia overachieved on previous climate targets, meaning it built up credits to offset against carbon emissions. But there was international opposition to the idea of using those credits instead of adopting more ambitious clean energy measures. This video can not be played In September the  EU Commission set out its blueprint  for reaching the 55% target by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures. To reach the 55% target, it says, annual investment in the energy system will need to be about \u20ac350bn higher across the EU. The volume of fossil fuel imports to the EU needs to fall by more than 25% compared to 2015 levels, it says. According to the Commission, by 2030 the proportion of renewable sources in power generation needs to rise to about 66% and fossil fuel sources diminish to under 20%.  In the first half of this year, the EU figure for electricity generation from renewables was 40% and that for fossil fuels was 34%.  Currently in the EU the burning of fossil fuels in the energy sector accounts for just over 75% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions, most of it CO2, the Commission says.

{"id":null,"body":"The UK's coastguard has issued a new warning urging people to be careful in the sea, after recording its highest number of call-outs in a single day for more than four years. Its teams dealt with 340 incidents and rescued 146 people on Saturday. Saturday was the second day of a mini-heatwave for parts of the UK, with temperatures hitting 34.5C (94.1F). A woman in her 30s died on Sunday after getting into difficulties in the sea off the coast in Waxham, Norfolk. She was recovered from the water but was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital, said Norfolk Police, adding that the death was being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.  The latest figures from the coastguard came just over a week after the coastguard reported  its previous record of 329 incidents . HM Coastguard's head of coastguard operations, Richard Hackwell, said there had been \"a big rise\" in incidents this weekend \"as more people visit coastal areas and head to the beach\".  \"We understand that people want to have fun at the coast and enjoy the heatwave but we urge everyone to respect the sea and take responsibility in helping to ensure the safety of themselves, friends and family,\" he said.  Separately, the RNLI called for people to wear life jackets if going out on the sea, after  a number of kayakers needed rescuing off the Devon coast  on Sunday.  The warnings came on another sweltering day for many Britons on Sunday, with a high of 34C recorded in East Sussex, according to BBC Weather. Earlier, it reached 24.3C in Scotland (Achnagart), 23C in Wales (Hawarden) and 21.6C in Northern Ireland (Ballywatticock), BBC Weather said. There will also be little relief from the warm weather overnight, particularly in south-east England, where some face a so-called tropical night - when temperatures stay above 20C. Crowds packed out beaches along the coast for the third day in a row on Sunday as the hot weather continued. Thanet District Council warned four of its beaches in Kent - Margate Main Sands, Viking Bay, Joss Bay and Ramsgate Main Sands - were \"extremely busy\", with high tide likely to make social distancing difficult. And Dorset Council urged people to avoid Lulworth and Durdle Door by midday due to large numbers in the area. Some seafront car parks in Dorset were full by mid-afternoon, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council warned beachgoers - via a new mobile app - of congestion on much of its 24 beaches. Meanwhile, a woman has died following  a collision between a water bike and a boat  off Anglesey, in Wales.  The coastguard co-ordinated search and rescue responses to a wide range of incidents on Saturday, including people being cut off by the tide and children swept out to sea on inflatables. In total, the service responded to 186 emergency 999 calls, rescued 146 people and assisted a further 371. Saturday's incident count represents a \"significant\" 145% increase compared to the average number of call-outs recorded throughout August 2019, the coastguard said in a statement.  Mr Hackwell stressed that beachgoers should \"check and double check tide times as even the most experienced swimmer or keen watersports enthusiast can get caught out by currents and tides\". And he encouraged people to plan their days out, \"always exercise caution\" and to make sure they have a way of contacting the coastguard if they get into trouble.  The hot weather is likely to continue into next week, with humid nights, according to BBC Weather.  Forecasters have predicted \"oppressive\" highs of 34C in the south-east during the day on Monday, with sunny spells expected elsewhere in the UK. However, there is a growing risk of thunderstorms. There is a chance of sharp showers that could turn thundery for some areas in western England and Wales on Monday. Yellow thunderstorm warnings have been issued for all parts of the UK for Monday through to Thursday, with the Met Office stating \"not everywhere will see them, but where they do occur they could be significant and disruptive\". Large parts of England and Wales have been warned there may be torrential rain, large hail, frequent lightning and strong gusty winds. Downpours could see rainfall of 20-30mm in an hour, with some locations potentially receiving 40-60mm in three hours. These would be fairly isolated instances, according to the Met Office. This video can not be played Friday saw the hottest August day in 17 years, with  the mercury hitting 36.4C  at London's Heathrow Airport and Kew Gardens.  Last week, the Met Office warned that climate change driven by industrial society is having  an increasing impact on the UK's weather . Its annual UK report confirmed that 2019 was the 12th warmest year in a series from 1884, and described the year as remarkable for high temperature records in the UK.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The world is in the middle of what is likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850, say scientists. The Met Office is forecasting that temperatures for each of the next five years are likely to be 1C or more above pre-industrial levels.  In the next five years there's also a chance we'll see a year in which the average global temperature rise could be greater than 1.5C. That's seen as a critical threshold for climate change.  If the data matches the forecast, then the decade from 2014-2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of record keeping. The Met Office says that 2015 was the first year in which the global annual average surface temperature reached 1C above the pre-industrial level, which is generally taken to mean the temperatures between 1850 and 1900.  Each year since then, the global average has hovered close to or above the 1C mark. Now, the Met Office says that trend is likely to continue or increase over the next five years.  \"We've just made this year's forecasts and they go out to 2023 and what they suggest is rapid warming globally,\" Prof Adam Scaife, head of long term forecasting at the Met Office, told BBC News.   \"By looking at individual years in that forecast we can now see for the first time, there is a risk of a temporary, and I repeat temporary, exceedance of the all-important 1.5C threshold level set out in the Paris climate agreement.\"  Last October,  UN scientists published a special report  on the long-term impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C.  They concluded that it would take a massive carbon cutting effort to keep the world from tipping over the limit by 2030. The Met Office analysis now says there's a 10% chance of this happening within the next five years.  \"It's the first time the forecasts have shown a significant risk of exceedance - it is only temporary. We are talking about individual years fluctuating above the 1.5 degree level,\" said Prof Scaife.  \"But the fact that that can happen now due to a combination of general warming and the fluctuations due to things like El Ni\u00f1o events in the next few years does mean we are getting close to that threshold.\"  The Met Office says it has a 90% confidence limit in the forecasts for the years ahead.  It says that from 2019 to 2023, we will see temperatures ranging from 1.03C to 1.57C above the 1850-1900 level, with enhanced warming over much of the globe, especially over areas like the Arctic. The research team says it is pretty certain in its predictions because of its past experience. The team's previous forecast, made in 2013, predicted the rapid rate of warming that's been observed over the past five years. It even predicted some of the lesser known details such as the patch of cooling seen in the North Atlantic and the cooler spots in the Southern Ocean. \r\n            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map\r\n         If the observations over the next five years match the forecasts, then the decade between 2014 and 2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of records.  The Met Office forecast comes as a number of agencies publish their full analysis of temperature data from 2018, showing it to be the fourth warmest since records began in 1850. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has published an analysis of five major international datasets showing that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22.  \"Temperatures are only part of the story. Extreme and high impact weather affected many countries and millions of people, with devastating repercussions for economies and ecosystems in 2018,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.  \"Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate. This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority,\" he said.  Other researchers in the field said the new forecast for the next five years was in line with expectations, given the record level of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere in 2018. \"The forecast from the Met Office is, unfortunately, no surprise,\" said Dr Anna Jones, an atmospheric chemist at the British Antarctic Survey. \"Temperatures averaged across the globe are at a record all-time high, and have been for a number of years. They are driven predominantly by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that result from our continued use of fossil fuels.  \"Until we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect to see upward trends in global averaged temperatures.\" Keeping Up Appearances' Clive Swift dies 'The day I went to prison, I got my life back' What's your area like for young people?

{"id":null,"body":"Africa is more vulnerable than any other region to the world's changing weather patterns, explains climate specialist Richard Washington. The African continent will be hardest hit by climate change.  There are four key reasons for this: Is Africa sleepwalking into a potential catastrophe? African climate is replete with complexity and marvels. The Sahara is the world's largest desert with the deepest layer of intense heating anywhere on Earth.  In June and July the most extensive and most intense dust storms found anywhere on the planet fill the air with fine particles that interfere with climate in ways we don't quite understand.  The region is almost completely devoid of weather measurements yet it is a key driver of the West African monsoon system, which brings three months of rain that interrupts the nine-month long dry season across the Sahel region, south of the desert. For the decades following the 1960s and peaking in 1984, there was a downturn of rainfall of some 30% across the Sahel, which led to famine and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of many millions. No other region has documented such a long and spatially extensive drought.  Evidence points to Western industrial aerosol pollution, which cooled parts of the global ocean, thereby altering the monsoon system, as a cause. The currently observed recovery of the rains is projected to continue through the 21st Century, particularly over the central and eastern Sahel. But that change seems to depend on exactly where future heating in the central Sahara peaks, emphasising cruelly the region we least understand. In southern Africa we are seeing a delay in the onset and a drying of early summer rains, which is predicted to worsen in forthcoming decades. Temperatures there are predicted to rise by five degrees or more, particularly in the parts of Namibia, Botswana and Zambia that are already intolerably hot. Meanwhile over Kenya and Tanzania, the long rains from March to May start later and end sooner - leading to an overall decrease in rainfall. This observed change sits uncomfortably next to predictions of a wetter future in the same season - a problem scientists have termed the East African Climate Paradox. Central Africa, one of three regions on the planet where thunderstorms drive the rest of the planet's tropical and sub-tropical weather systems, lives perilously close to the rainfall minimum needed to support the world's second largest rainforest system. Even a little less rainfall in the future could endanger the forest and its massive carbon store.  We know remarkably little about that climate system - it is scarcely even monitored - there are more reporting rain gauges in the UK county of Oxfordshire than the entire Congo Basin. Africa's complex climate system is, unusually, influenced by the three main global ocean basins. Emerging from one of those rapidly warming oceans, tropical cyclones Idai and Kenneth in March and April 2019 destroyed parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, with Kenneth following a particularly unusual path over Tanzania. But on the scientific front there is hope. In collaborative efforts we are working intensely hard to improve climate prediction. Projections of climate change depend on climate models of which there are dozens, each as complicated to understand as the real world. Through efforts such as the ongoing Future Climate for Africa (FCFA), a programme funded by the UK's Department for International Development and Natural Environment Research Council, the experience and insights of African climate scientists have led to a discernible jump in our ability to understand and model African climate.  We have new insights brought through that scientific ingenuity. This video can not be played Each region and sub-region of Africa is changing differently but an emerging commonality is a shift towards more intense rainfall - even where there is observed and projected future drying. The rainfall arrives in shorter bursts, causing more runoff and longer dry-spells in between. New models, developed as part of FCFA, are now run at extremely high resolution with grid spacing of around 4km (2.5 miles) for the entire continent. The results point unambiguously to an increase in both rainfall intensity and the length of dry spells, and we have strong reason to believe them. Central to that rainfall change is the behaviour of thunderstorms, which deliver around 70% of African rain. Standard global climate models can only represent these key systems indirectly but the new models are capable of representing thunderstorms systems adequately for the first time.  This is part of the approach we are adopting - to find out exactly how the models simulate the changing weather.  From an extremely modestly resourced lab in Cameroon, for example, Wilfried Pokam and his team of researchers are exposing the way that the central African climate system and southern Africa are linked, thereby breaking the mould of our stubborn piecemeal, regional view of the continent's climate system.  Such breakthroughs are improbable when you consider that these researchers download massive data sets through cheap Sim cards in their mobile phones and analyse the output overnight. By day, they keep the first Lidar system in central Africa running. The Lidar measures winds in the lowest few kilometres of the atmosphere, helping to fill the vast data void in central Africa. They are part of a set of young scientists joining the race to set adaptation to climate change in motion before Africa is overwhelmed. It is a matter of social justice that we succeed. Africa will be hardest hit by climate change, but has contributed the least to causing that change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Who occupies the White House for the next four years could play a critical role in the fight against dangerous climate change, experts say. Matt McGrath weighs the likely environmental consequences of the US election. Scientists studying climate change say that the re-election of Donald Trump could make it \"impossible\" to keep global temperatures in check. They're worried another four years of Trump would \"lock in\" the use of fossil fuels for decades to come - securing and enhancing the infrastructure for oil and gas production rather than phasing them out as environmentalists want. Joe Biden's climate plan, the scientists argue, would give the world a fighting chance. In addition to withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement - the international pact designed to avoid dangerous warming of the Earth - President Trump's team has worked hard to remove what they see as obstacles to efficient energy production. Over the past three years,  researchers at Columbia University in New York have tracked  more than 160 significant rollbacks of environmental regulations. These cover everything from car fuel standards, to methane emissions, to light bulbs.  This bonfire of red tape has occurred at the same time that the US is reeling from several years' worth of severe wildfires in western states.  Many scientists have linked these fires to climate change .   So where are we after four years of Donald Trump - and where are things likely to go after the election on 3 November? \"Trump believes that regulations are all cost and no benefit,\" says Prof Michael Gerrard from Columbia University in New York.  \"He denies that there really is such a thing as anthropogenic climate change, or at least that it is bad. He believes that if you cut back on regulations of all kinds, not just environmental, but also occupational and labour and everything else, it'll create more jobs.\" Critics say the rollbacks on environmental regulations are part of an agenda to remove any reference to climate change across the federal government. \"The Trump administration has done everything they can to deny the science and denigrate scientists,\" says Gina McCarthy, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and now the president of the  NRDC Action Fund . \"They have really done everything humanly possible to try to convince people that what they see and feel and taste just isn't happening in front of them.\"  President Trump's supporters will say that his strong support for fossil fuels has been a success. Thanks to fracking, the US  briefly became the world's biggest oil exporter  late last year. Fracking is a set of techniques for recovering oil and gas from shale rock. But when it comes to coal, the story is different. Despite the administration's efforts to undo regulations,  mining has continued to decline  with around 5,000 fewer coal-related jobs now than when Donald Trump was elected. For many of those backing Trump, his actions on the climate are consistent with boosting energy production and keeping the economy growing. Others argue that Trump's war on environmental regulations has nothing to do with economics at all.  \"Trump is convinced that climate change is a culture war issue that ignites the resentment of his far right base,\" says Paul Bledsoe, who served in the Clinton administration and is now an adviser to the Democrat think tank, the  Progressive Policy Institute .  \"So he sees this as a cultural effort to ignite grievance among his base. It has no other function for him.\" Pulling out of the Paris agreement was a  strong message  to the rest of the world that the US no longer shared the international consensus on climate change.  When announcing the pull-out, President Trump spoke of re-negotiating the agreement, but nothing has come of that idea. Some observers believe that US actions have made it easier for other nations, like Brazil and Saudi Arabia, to  stymie progress on cutting carbon emissions . \"Right now, we're a pariah, And this is the most embarrassing and shockingly bad time that I could ever imagine for the United States,\" says Gina McCarthy. \"And it's all because we have a president who simply doesn't give a damn about people. He just gives a damn about his own base, and how it feeds his own ego.\" If Joe Biden wins, it is likely he will reverse the pull-out from Paris as soon as possible. Re-joining the pact requires only a month's notice. The president's decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement will take effect on 4 November, one day after the election.  However, opinion polls show that  growing numbers of young Republicans  and conservatives are taking a different position to the President on climate change. But many still support his decision to leave the Paris pact.  \"What I've found is that really big goals and really high targets don't really mean anything if you don't actually have a plan to achieve that goal,\" says Danielle Butcher who describes herself as a young conservative with the  American Conservation Coalition . \"We've got China saying that they're going to reduce their emissions by this year. And they're financing coal plants all around the world.\"  \"Even though the Paris Agreement may sound good, there has to be follow through, right?\" Evangelical Christians are among the religious groups to have strongly supported President Trump.  Polling shows that they will probably turn out for him again in overwhelming numbers . But younger members of the faith are less enchanted with the president, especially on the topic of climate change.  Emily Robertson is a 21-year-old student at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, and a first time voter in this election.  She says that if she could have voted last time round she would probably have voted for Trump, like her parents did.  But her growing awareness of the climate change issue has persuaded her to vote for Joe Biden this time. \"On social media platforms, I have seen a lot of young evangelicals move toward voting for Biden, but those are in select circles,\" she says. \"So for some people, perhaps, but honestly, just based on some people I have talked to, even though they care about climate change, I don't believe they care enough to still vote for Biden rather than Trump.\" As well as confirming America's departure from the Paris deal, a win for Trump will likely see further efforts to step up fossil fuel production. This could have serious consequences for global temperatures. \"The 1.5C temperature target is very difficult to achieve right now, although it is theoretically possible,\" says Michael Gerrard. He's referring to one of the goals of the Paris agreement - a global rise in temperature of 1.5C is regarded as a kind of gateway to dangerous levels of warming.  Two years ago,  a scientific review of the target  concluded that keeping the temperature rise under this threshold would make a  huge difference to people and to nature, compared to letting them increase by 2C (which previously regarded as this threshold for many years).  \"If Trump is re-elected, I think it goes into the realm of physical impossibility,\" says Prof Gerrard. \"We'd have to wait another four years for another election to try to rectify that. But by then, a lot more fossil fuel infrastructure will have been locked in and a lot more greenhouse gases will have gone into the atmosphere. So, it would be very bad news for the climate indeed.\" In some parts of the US, the lack of action from the White House on climate change has served as a call to action. For residents in the coastal city of Charleston, South Carolina, questions of climate and sea level rise are high on the list of political issues.  Water levels in Charleston harbour used to rise about 2.5cm every decade - now they're going up by that amount every two years.  With a pressing need for new sea defences, the  local authority has decided to sue 24 fossil fuel companies  for their role in producing the carbon that is linked to the rising waters.  \"Flooding is at this point an issue on 100 days of the year,\" said local climate activist Belvin Olasov. \"This situation calls for leadership and there is currently a huge vacuum, because of the President that we have.\"  \"So you have a city government taking on a giant conglomeration of oil corporations because nothing is being done on the federal level.\" \"It is an unusual situation that we've been pushed into.\" Many states and regions have pushed ahead with climate action, but this has its limits. For example, road transportation is responsible for around one third of US carbon emissions but car fuel standards are set by the Federal government. While the Obama administration sought to strengthen them significantly, President Trump has watered them down. Joe Biden says that his  plan for climate change  would see the US energy sector go carbon-free by 2035. This would allow the country to become a net zero emitter by 2050. Achieving net zero means that any carbon emitted by industry, transport or other sources is balanced out by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, through, for example, planting forests. Mr Biden has ambitious ideas to revolutionise transport in the US using electric vehicles and trains. He also wants to build 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units. His plan would not just benefit the US, say supporters, it would help keep global temperatures down. \"This is the first election ever that really may determine whether we can prevent runaway climate change,\" says Paul Bledsoe. \"Joe Biden is proposing that the US adopt climate change tariffs on nations who do not reduce their emissions. Biden's international climate plan, if anything, is even more ambitious than his domestic plan. So the contrast could not be starker.\" President Trump has accused his opponent of wanting to ban fracking. But Biden says it should continue as the US transitions to a green economy. The oil and gas boom opened up by fracking - including in battleground states such as Pennsylvania - means thousands of jobs hang in the balance. The candidates are aware of the need to tread carefully - irrespective of their more general positions on climate change. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Megan Janetsky Medell\u00edn At Colombian dinner tables \u00c1lvaro Uribe has always been a topic \"better avoided\", explains political organiser Isabel P\u00e9rez.  No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, Colombia's ex-president who governed for two terms from 2002 to 2010, and perhaps the most powerful individual in the country, sparks passion. Some view Mr Uribe as a hero, whose strong-armed military tactics in his government's war against guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) quelled violence in much of the country.  Others say that those same tactics led to gross human rights violations, including the extrajudicial killings of thousands of innocent people.  His critics describe him as a villain and accuse him of having ties with paramilitary groups, which he has denied.   That split often runs down a generational line. Older Colombians have stark memories of the violence before President Uribe's time in office while younger Colombians associate the right-wing politician with the damaging investigations that now plague his political legacy. \"There are people in my larger family who continue to defend Uribe,\" says Ms P\u00e9rez, 29, a grassroots political organiser in the city of Medell\u00edn, \u00c1lvaro Uribe's political stamping ground.  \"They don't believe he did anything bad,\" she explains, saying that theirs is almost an emotional defence. \"They believe he is the saviour of the motherland.\" The conflict between those who love and those who loathe Mr Uribe reared its head again earlier this month when Colombia's Supreme Court ordered the politician to be placed under house arrest while he is under investigation for alleged witness tampering.  More recently, Mr Uribe has been called on by the court to testify in another investigation into his potential connection to three massacres in the 1990s. The probe could settle longstanding allegations linking Mr Uribe to paramilitary death squads. The political fallout forced the South American country to once again reckon with an unresolved past and an uncertain future.  And while intense debate around Mr Uribe reopens old wounds, a growing number of young Colombians crave a more forward-looking political discourse. \"The majority of people under 30 years old at this moment haven't lived through the age before \u00c1lvaro Uribe. They were kids. They don't view Uribe as the saviour of anything,\" says Ariel \u00c1vila, the deputy director of the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation NGO.  \"They see him as an old guy, part complicated, part criminal, but famous,\" Mr \u00c1vila adds. But 72-year-old Francisco Alzate does remember that time. Mr Alzate grew up in Medell\u00edn and vividly recalls the violence that once dominated the streets.  His wife, too, was acutely touched by the decades of armed conflict, forced to flee from her home town of Granada after it was bombed by guerrillas.  \"(Uribe) has been the blockade to the violence that has attacked the country,\" he said. \"In times past we couldn't even leave Medell\u00edn to [go to] other municipalities. ... We were totally encircled by the guerrillas.\" Mr Alzate, who collects historical items, has built up an assortment of framed political posters, T-shirts and photos of the ex-president, which line the walls of his home. Despite the many allegations and investigations into Mr Uribe, Mr Alzate says he has remained loyal to Mr Uribe's far-right party, the Democratic Centre, because he \"brought back peace.\" The problem, critics say, is at what humanitarian cost.  Like many of Mr Uribe's loyal supporters, Mr Alzate reacted to his detention with outrage, calling it \"a blow to the Colombian people\" even though opinion polls suggest that the majority of Colombians support the court decision. Polls also suggest that disapproval of the ex-president runs high, in marked contrast to the public support he enjoyed while he was in power from 2002 to 2010. Many other Colombians, like Isabel P\u00e9rez, saw the decision as an opportunity to shift the political discussion forward and stop rehashing the same political battles that have polarised Colombia for decades.  Ms P\u00e9rez says that the detention represents not only the waning power of a once larger-than-life political figure, but also a chance for new voices to be heard. \"I think he's a character that is losing power,\" she explains. \"And for this person to lose power, it could open space for others. ... We're entering a political discussion in a post-Uribe time.\" Mr Uribe's supporters and Uribismo, the political current they espouse, once had a firm political hold on the region, but it has slipped in recent years.  In local elections in 2018, his party lost ground countrywide, and in Medell\u00edn an independent candidate won the coveted seat of mayor. The Democratic Centre has struggled with an identity crisis for a long time, explains analyst Ariel \u00c1vila.  After Farc guerrillas demobilised during Colombia's 2016 peace accords, the party lost its common enemy. While the Democratic Centre's candidate, Iv\u00e1n Duque, won the 2018 presidential election, he has been highly unpopular and has not proven to be the forward-looking extension of Mr Uribe's policies the party faithful had hoped for, says Mr \u00c1vila. The move away from Uribismo was most acutely felt in November, when hundreds of thousands of Colombians across the country took part in mass protests against President Duque and his political mentor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe.  Driven mainly by young students, the protests carried on for more than a month. Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Rey, 19, is a political organiser for Youth of the Democratic Centre in Medell\u00edn, a group which aims to attract younger people to the party.  It is no secret that Uribismo has an age problem, he and other organisers say. To draw younger Colombians to the table, they have had to branch out, using social media to reach new audiences.  They have increasingly focused their conversations around topics like climate change and anti-corruption legislation that spark more unity than division. Those are the topics that Isabel P\u00e9rez also cares about. \"If we as Colombians want the country to move forward, we need to be having other discussions,\" Mr Rey argues. But, like Francisco Alzate, he also sees the need to defend his embattled political leader.  \"We can't forget the legacy of President Uribe,\" he says. \"But we have to also look at the new generation in politics. It doesn't just have to be young people, it has to be people with new ideas,\" he argues.

{"id":null,"body":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she supports school students' protests about climate change. It appears to contradict some education officials, who have criticised participants for skipping school and threatened them with exclusion. Mrs Merkel said students might be frustrated at the time taken to move away from coal-based energy but asked them to understand it was a challenge. Across the world, some students have been leaving school to demand action. On Friday thousands of high school students in the city of Hamburg marched against climate change, with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg - who started the series of school strikes - present. But the city's education official, Ties Rabe, wrote on Twitter: \"No-one makes the world better by skipping school.\" Meanwhile the education minister in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia has told schools that students face disciplinary action up to and including expulsion if they do not comply with their legal duty to go to school. In a video released on her official website,  Angela Merkel said protecting the climate was a \"challenge that people can only tackle together\"  (in German). Asked about the Friday school strikes, which in Germany have been dubbed \"Fridays for Future\", Ms Merkel said the country's climate goals could only be reached with the support of wider society. \"So I very much welcome that young people, school students, demonstrate and tell us to do something fast about climate change,\" she said. \"I think it is a very good initiative,\" she added, without making reference to the fact that they were protesting during school hours. This video can not be played But, she said, in her role she had to let them know that there were many steps to take before the full switch-off of coal, planned for Germany by 2038. \"From the students' point of view,\" Ms Merkel continued, \"that may seem like a very long way away, but it will challenge us very much so I ask them to understand that too.\" Two years ago  a small survey suggested that Germans worried more about climate change  than they did about terrorism.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent  While high temperatures were critical to the melting seen in Greenland last year, scientists say that clear blue skies also played a key role.  In a study, they found that a record number of cloud free days saw more sunlight hit the surface while snowfall was also reduced. These conditions were due to wobbles in the fast moving jet stream air current that also trapped heat over Europe.  As a result, Greenland's ice sheet lost an estimated 600 billion tonnes. Current climate models don't include the impact of the wandering jet stream say the authors, and may be underestimating the impact of warming. Greenland's ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m. Last December,  researchers reported that the Greenland ice sheet was melting seven times faster  than it had been during the 1990s.  In recent weeks, an analysis of last year's melting said the 600 billion tonnes of ice added 2.2mm to global sea levels in just two months. This new study says that while rising global temperatures played a role in the events last year, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns were also to blame.  Researchers found that high pressure weather conditions prevailed over Greenland for record amounts of time.  They believe this is connected to what's termed the \"waviness\" in the jet stream, the giant current of air that mostly flows from west to east around the globe. As the current becomes more wobbly, it bends north, and high pressure systems that would normally move through in a few days become \"blocked' over Greenland. These systems had different impacts depending on the part of Greenland you were in. In the southern part of the island, the authors say, it caused clearer skies with more sunlight hitting the surface.  The cloud-free days brought less snow, which meant that 50 billion fewer tonnes were added to the ice sheet.  The absence of snow also exposed bare, dark ice in some place which absorbed more heat - contributing to the melt.  In other parts of Greenland, the changing atmospheric patterns had different but equally damaging impacts. In northern and western region, the swirling but stuck high pressure systems pulled in warm air from southern latitudes.  \"You can imagine that a sort of vacuum cleaner that is spinning clockwise and sucking all the warm and moist air from New York City for example,\" said lead author Dr Marco Tedesco from Columbia University in New York, US. \"And because of the rotation, it deposits this warm, moist air high in the northern part. It forms clouds, and they behave like a greenhouse, trapping the heat that would normally radiate off the ice.\" Dr Tedesco explained that Greenland in 2019 experienced the largest drop in surface mass balance since records began in 1948.  The term surface mass balance describes the overall state of the ice sheet after accounting for gains from snowfall and losses from surface melt-water run-off. The authors believe their study explains why, despite the fact that 2019 was not as warm as 2012, last year produced a record drop in surface mass balance.  \"This is really pushing Greenland into the red,\" said Dr Tedesco.  Other researchers working in this field agreed that the new paper is a good explanation of what happened last year in Greenland.  \"The main message of the paper is that the very high melt was mostly driven by clear skies and direct melting rather than necessarily being attributable to unusually high temperatures over the ice sheet - a radiatively-driven, rather than thermally-driven, melt season as they put it,\" said Dr Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen. \"In some ways, the weather pattern is rather similar to the great blocking high that lodged over Scandinavia for weeks in 2018, giving us the most extreme drought on record in much of northern Europe.\" The exact mechanism by which climate change affects the jet stream isn't understood. But the view is that as the Arctic warms, the temperature differences between the region and the mid-latitudes that drive the air current are reduced. This slows down the stream, making it wander further.  \"The more CO2 we pump out, the more divergence starts to emerge between the behaviour of the Arctic and the mid-latitudes and this behaviour is accelerating and enhancing some of the differences. It is a crucial part of what is creating this waviness and the consequences,\" said Dr Tedesco. The authors also argue that climate models in general need to take account of this impact of the wavy jet stream. Others in the field say this issue needs addressing. \"These results imply that the climate models we use for future projections of sea level rise from Greenland are underestimating the extreme years at present and therefore likely also the rate at which the ice sheet melts and the oceans will rise in the future,\" said Dr Mottram. \"The only ray of light is that as processor power increases and we can do higher resolution simulations with climate models, the representation of these processes does seem to improve and not just in Greenland but in other areas of the world where persistent blocking patterns can have an important influence on the season.\" The study has been published in the journal  The Cryosphere .

{"id":null,"body":"By Taylor Kate Brown BBC News Magazine Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events around the world. One US group has given the 50 states a report card, ranking the risk of potential disasters and long-term dangerous changes. Most US states are well-prepared for current natural disasters, but across the country, states have done little to factor  in how climate change will increase or change risks  - from wildfire, extreme heat, inland and coastal flooding and drought.  \"Many of these states haven't even assessed their vulnerability,\" with climate change explicitly in mind, says Richard Wiles, senior vice president of Climate Central, a climate change research group. The organisation developed a \"report card\" of climate change resilience for each state with the help of ICF international, a consulting firm. Future planning often involves more difficult infrastructure changes, Wiles says, like moving roads at serious risk of being underwater in the future.  But very few states incorporate this into their long-term planning documents, which often set where money will be invested. \"These climate threats aren't sneaking up on anybody,\" Wiles says. The response from states has been mixed. In a press conference on Friday, a collection of Miami-area counties said they agreed with their state's overall grade, but said the report ignored the work of the state's water management districts as well as a compact of south Florida counties working to adapt to higher sea levels,  the Sun Sentinel reported .  \"One of the challenges of doing a report card on climate preparedness is that states are likely to be doing additional things that can be put into the climate change adaptation bucket, but are not being described that way,\" says Erika Spanger-Siegfried of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Climate and Energy programme. \"We need to be having conversations about climate risk,\" she says. \"I think [a report card] has the ability to advance the conversation - especially if it's done periodically.\" Climate Central  gave five states failing grades . The analysis of the changing threats is based on a projected global temperature rise if no major action is taken to limit carbon emissions. For state actions, researchers combined published policies and programmes with interviews with state employees working on these issues. Mississippi Mississippi already averages 25 days a year of dangerous heat and 1.7 million people potentially threatened by wildfire, according to the report. But the state has taken no climate-change driven action. By 2050, the state is projected to have 100 dangerous heat days a year - third in the entire nation - and 60 days of high wildfire potential. The state currently tracks the impact of coastal flooding, but there are no plans or policies in place to deal with climate change risks. Mississippi's emergency management department told the BBC they were proud that the report recognised \"our current strong State Mitigation Plan, State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan and other steps that address current risk. \"All Mississippi agencies can and will adapt to any changes and continue to be strong in the future,\" a spokesman said in a email. Missouri  Missouri's risks over the next 40 years will increase significantly, especially from heat, according to the report. The state is estimated to go from 15 dangerous heat days a year to 60 days a year by 2050. The state has started tracking the impact of extreme heat on water and health, but has made no future plans for such an increase. It also faces increasing threats from drought, wildfire and inland flooding. A spokesman for the state's emergency management agency cited Missouri's advanced mitigation plan, heat wave action plan and noted the state has led the US in the number of home buyouts in flood-affected areas, effectively resettling neighbourhoods to higher ground. Texas Texas is a case of extremes. In Climate Central's analysis, it's the state expected to have the greatest threat from drought and wildfires by 2050 and the second-greatest threat from extreme heat - a total of 115 dangerous heat days per year. Yet the state does not include heat or drought in its current emergency management plan, never mind future planning. In a statement, the Texas department of public safety said they participate \"in a yearly threat and risk assessment to ensure all likely hazards are included in preparedness efforts for the state\". Arkansas In 2008, an Arkansas report briefly mentioned how the state's climate could change as a result of global warning, but very little on the issue has been done since then.  The state ranks third in the report for future inland flooding risk, with more than 200,000 people threatened. Officials have made no future plans to deal with events like heavy rain.  Heat wave days are projected to quadruple by 2050, according to Climate Central's analysis. Nevada Nevada is doing less to deal with extreme heat in the present - despite an already hot climate - because it identifies it as a \"low risk\". And while the state has said wildfires may increase in the future, they've not planned for any, or even done a vulnerability assessment.  By 2050, about 45% of the state's population will live in places where housing development and wild lands mix - increasing risk for damage and loss of life due to wildfire. Better  preparation Not all heavily threatened states have received bad grades. California, currently in the middle of a multi-year historic drought, gained an \"A\" score. It's gone beyond planning for a changing climate and started changing its own policies for all five threats. \"It's hard not to be impressed with California,\" says Kathy Jacobs, director of Center for Climate Adaptation Science at the University of Arizona. She says one of the reasons the state has been able to take action is because the state has established a tax on carbon. The report does not take into consideration well-prepared individual cities or regions within the poorly performing states, nor private initiatives. Some additional highlights: COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.

{"id":null,"body":"By Adrienne Murray Technology of Business reporter, Faroe Islands Sunshine has given way to wind and rain, as the motorboat chugs through a fjord in the Faroe Islands.  \"Its a bit windy here,\" says Olavur Gregarsen. \"We'll see how far we can get to the harvesting boat.\"  We soon reach a sheltered spot where steep mountains are looking down on hundreds of buoys bobbing in the sea.  \"They are holding up a horizontal line,\" explains Mr Gregarsen, the managing director of Ocean Rainforest, a seaweed producer.  \"At every metre another line hangs down, and that's where the seaweed grows.\" Anchored to the sea floor, the cultivation rig consists of 50,000m (164,000ft) of underwater lattice-like ropes, designed to withstand rough sea conditions.  \"The main structure is 10m down. That way we avoid the largest breaking waves,\" he says. Despite the Danish territory's remote North Atlantic location, Mr Gregarsen says the deep, nutrient-rich, waters are well suited for growing seaweed, with a stable temperature of between 6C and 11C. His firm is among a wave of seaweed farms that have sprung up in Europe and North America, spurred by a growing demand from the food industry and others.  \"You have a biomass that can be used for food and feed, and replacing fossil-based products like packaging material from plastic,\" he says. Seaweeds are fast-growing algae. They utilise energy from sunlight, and take up nutrients and carbon dioxide from the seawater. Scientists suggest seaweed could help fight climate change and offset carbon emissions. Ocean Rainforest recently won funding from the US Department of Energy to build a similar system in California, where there's interest in developing industrialised seaweed production for future biofuels. Aboard the harvesting boat the skipper controls a mechanical arm that lifts lines from the water. The seaweed is chopped free, filling up containers. It's quick but messy work. The lines are then left to regrow. This year around 200 tonnes will be harvested. But the company is scaling up, and plans to double its capacity this year. It isn't making money just yet, but expects to soon, Mr Gregarsen tells me.  \"We can see how we can mechanise this, how we can make this a really large-scale efficient activity,\" he says. \"There are not many companies that do this as a profitable business, if any.\" Seaweed needs to be processed quickly.  At a small plant in the Faroese village of Kaldbak, machines clean the harvest. Some is dried and supplied to food manufacturers. The rest is fermented and shipped to animal feed producers.  Most farmed seaweed is consumed in food, but extracts are used in a wide variety of products. Whether it is toothpaste, cosmetics, medicines or pet food, these often contain hydrocolloids derived from seaweed, which have gelling or thickening properties. And more products are coming, with other firms working on textiles and plastic alternatives, including biodegradable packaging, water capsules, and drinking straws. More Technology of Business Seaweed production has boomed. Between 2005 and 2015 volumes doubled, surpassing 30 million tonnes annually, reports the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. It is a business worth more than $6bn (\u00a35bn) worldwide.  Yet only a fraction of cultivation happens outside Asia, where farming is a long-established, but mostly labour-intensive activity. \"The labour cost is really high in Europe, so that's one major part of it,\" explains Annette Bruhn, who is a senior scientist at Aarhus University in Denmark.  \"A lot of effort needs to be put into mechanisation and upscaling.\" To make farming economical, she says \"the yield needs to go up and the cost needs to go down\". But farming systems aren't easily replicated. \"Different areas in different waters, all require modifications. There's not one solution that can be expected to fit all,\" says Ms Bruhn. However, she is hopeful, and says there are \"many areas where you can have breakthroughs\". That is what innovators like Sintef are trying to do. The Norwegian scientific research group is working on new technologies to streamline farming.  \"Now most of the seaweed is used for food, but in the future we want to use it for fish feed, fertilisers, biogas. We need large volumes and we need to produce much faster,\" says research scientist Silje Forbord. Prototype machines such as the \"seaweed spinner\" automatically wrap spools of seedling-carrying threads onto lines, ready for deployment at sea.  Another concept, SPoke (Standardized Production of Kelp), consists of circular farm modules where seaweed grows from lines radiating outwards. It is designed so a robot can move along the wheel-like spokes - either attaching threads carrying juvenile seaweed or harvesting it. \"We've built one arm with a robot going back and forth. That has been tested in a dry lab,\" explains Ms Forbord, but more investment will be needed. In a series of ponds and tanks in northern Portugal, AlgaPlus is cultivating seaweed inland. \"It's a much more controlled environment,\" says managing director Helena Abreu, who thinks there are more advantages compared to farming offshore. \"We maintain the temperature and everything inside the tanks,\" she says. \"You have year-round production.\" Ms Abreu co-founded the firm after spending five years as a marine biologist in the Azores. Small, high-value seaweeds are produced for food companies, cosmetics makers and high-end restaurants. Seawater from a coastal lagoon flows into fish ponds. It is then pumped through a filtration system into tanks growing seaweed. There's also a hatchery breeding the seedlings. \"We had to innovate from scratch,\" she says. These waters are rich in nitrogen, which the algae take up, mimicking nature. \"We don't need to use any additives, no fertiliser. We use water from the fish to grow our seaweed,\" she says. Ms Abreu doesn't think availability of land is a limiting factor. Former salt works and fish farms could be repurposed, she says, pointing out there are hectares of availability in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey. Onshore seaweed farming takes place in Canada and South Africa too. Micro-algae are also grown in tank systems. But there are other challenges.  \"The main bottleneck is energy cost. Working with tanks you need the pumping and the aeration to keep the water moving,\" says Ms Abreu. The firm can't survive on sales alone just yet. But Ms Abreu is convinced that the seaweed market will continue to grow.  \"It's a huge trend,\" she says. \"Every year there's more and more companies. There are newcomers in all steps of the value chain.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent The price of flour and bread is set to rise after what could be the worst UK wheat harvest in 40 years, the industry is warning. Farmers say that the extreme weather over the last year is likely to mean wheat yields are down by up to 40%. As a result, some millers have already increased the price of flour by 10% and they warn a no-deal Brexit could push up prices even further. And we're likely to see more of the same weather in future, experts say. The UK Met Office told BBC News that the extremes of wet and hot conditions that have marked this year are likely to become more common as our climate continues to change. Wheat farmers have been hit with a triple-whammy of severe weather, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU). First off, unusually heavy rain in the autumn meant many farmers could not plant as much wheat as they usually would. What they did plant did not thrive in the waterlogged soil. That was followed by the wettest February on record. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered much of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding. They were followed by Storm Jorge at the end of February. Then we had the very hot and dry spring which caused droughts in many areas of the UK, making it hard for the crop to take up nutrients from the soil. Finally, the heavy rain this August meant many farmers have had to delay harvesting their crops. \"We're looking at a 30% reduction in our good fields, in some of our poor fields it's is even more\", said Matt Culley, an arable farmer from Hampshire who is chair of the NFU's crop board. Some of his grain stores are virtually empty where normally they would be full at this time of year.  He said much of the wheat that the rain has forced him to leave in the fields will only be fit for animal feed. It is, said Mr Culley, the worst harvest in the 37 years he's been farming, with the most dramatic variation in the weather he has ever known. A spokesperson for the Met Office explained: \"UK climate projections show a trend towards hotter and drier summers and warmer, wetter winters.\" Since 85% of the wheat used for flour is grown here in the UK, flour millers will have to make up the shortages caused by this year's dire harvest with imports. And, because the price of wheat has been increasing steadily since the summer, the price of flour will rise, says Alex Waugh who runs the National Association of British and Irish Millers. He says wheat prices are already up by \u00a340 a tonne - an increase of more than 20%.  Because the margins millers operate on are very tight, they will have no choice but to pass some of this increase on to consumers by raising prices. \"It's reached the point where we can't afford to keep selling flour at the price that we are,\" Paul Munsey of Wessex Mill in Oxfordshire told BBC News. He has already increased the price of his flour by 12% and warns there may be further price rises to come.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, wheat imports could be liable for a \u00a379 per tonne tariff, said the National Association of British and Irish Millers. This figure is derived from the World Trade Organization (WTO) standard tariff for wheat. Wheat prices are always volatile, but this would represent a further 40% hike in wheat prices which, once again, would be likely to drive up the price of flour. And when the price of flour rises, you can expect the price of bread to rise a little - as well as the price of biscuits, pastries and cakes. Agata Towpik runs Marcopolo Bakery in Wantage which specialises in craft bread. She says she is - very reluctantly - considering raising her prices. It will be only the second time she has done so since she and her husband Peter started the business a decade ago. \"Flour is our main ingredient and all the prices are increasing at the moment, so that will probably force us to put our prices up,\" she said. \"We love our customers and want as many of them as possible to be able to buy from us. But there's less money coming into the company and we've got employees and rent to pay.\" Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found. One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions.  A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated.  The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution.  Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold.  Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change.  In the UK,  promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees  were a feature of last year's general election. In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the  Trillion Trees Campaign . Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress. Another major tree planting initiative is called the  Bonn Challenge . Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030. So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea. But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests.  They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber.  The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees.  These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly.  The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy. The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests.  While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations.  Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest.  The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss. \"If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,\" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University.  \"That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.\" A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere. Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio. Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert.  Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon.  But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density.  The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate.  \"We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,\" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study.  \"Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.\" Both papers have been published in the journal  Nature Sustainability .

{"id":null,"body":"London could feel as hot as Barcelona by 2050, with Edinburgh's climate more like Paris, Leeds feeling like Melbourne and Cardiff like Montevideo. That's from a study looking at how a 2C temperature increase could change the world's 520 major cities. And that's not as good as it might sound. More than a fifth, including Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, will experience conditions big cities haven't seen before, the Crowther Lab says. London could suffer from the type of extreme drought that hit Barcelona in 2008 - when it was forced to import drinking water from France at a cost of \u00a320 million. The 2C rise by 2050 is comparing the present day to what temperatures were in the \"pre-industrial period\" -  usually considered to be  between the years 1850 and 1900 - when fossil-fuel burning hadn't yet changed the climate. That temperature increase would result in the average UK temperature during summer's hottest month increasing by about six degrees to 27C. Scientists hope pairing up cities will help people visualise the impact climate change could have within their own lifetimes.  \"History has repeatedly shown us that data and facts alone do not inspire humans to change their beliefs or act,\" lead author Jean-Francois Bastin said.  The study, published in the journal PLOS One, suggests summers and winters in Europe will get warmer, with average increases of 3.5C and 4.7C respectively. It's the equivalent to a city shifting 620 miles (1,000km) further south - with those furthest away from the equator being most affected. Governments around the world have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050. The global temperature has already increased by 1C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says.  And at the current rate of warming - 0.2C per decade - global warming will reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052.  The UN body has warned that exceeding 1.5C warming will push us into \"a highly uncertain world\" - adding that \"the current global commitments are not sufficient to prevent temperature rise above 2C, let alone 1.5C\". It estimates that under current national commitments, average temperature increases will range from 2.9C to 3.4C by 2100. To keep us below 1.5C, the panel says carbon emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030, and reach  net zero  by 2050.  So this study's projections are actually quite optimistic, imagining a future where action has been taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Its authors worked from a scenario where emissions peak in 2040 and then begin to decline.  The report predicts that three quarters of the world's major cities will experience dramatic climate shifts under those conditions. \"This study helps to put climate change in the context of human experience - and more importantly, shows that many places will see entirely new climates that are outside of current human experience,\" said Professor Richard Betts, from the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was commenting on the study. The University of Reading's Professor Mike Lockwood warned about the damage that could be done to infrastructure.  \"Bringing Barcelona's climate to London sounds like it could be a good thing - if you don't suffer from asthma or have a heart condition, that is - except London clay shrinks and is brittle if it gets too dry and then swells and expands when very wet. \"As ever, there is destructive and unforeseen devil in the details of climate change.\" Europe has experienced extremes already this summer, with two months' worth of rainfall  falling in a day in some parts of the UK , followed by a heatwave  made five times more likely because of climate change . Professor Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, said this study \"doesn't capture individual events like unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall or flooding\". She added: \"Also, sea level rise will add to the difficulties faced by many of these cities.\" It's not good news - but it's important not to feel  overwhelmed by the scale of the climate crisis .

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Investing $1.8 trillion over the next decade - in measures to adapt to climate change - could produce net benefits worth more than $7 trillion.  This is according to a global cost-benefit analysis setting out five adaptation strategies. The analysis was carried out by the  Global Commission on Adaptation  - a group of 34 leaders in politics, business and science.  They say the world urgently needs to be made more \"climate change resilient\".  The commission, led by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, argues that it is an urgent moral obligation of richer countries to invest in adaptation measures that will benefit the world.  The report says those most affected by climate change \"did least to cause the problem - making adaptation a human imperative\". This video can not be played Its primary aim is to put climate change adaptation on to the political agenda around the world. And to do this, it sets out \"concrete solutions\" and an economic plan.  There are, it says, five things the world should invest in over the next decade:  Each of these investments, the commission says, would contribute to what they call a \"triple dividend\"- avoiding future losses, generating positive economic gains through innovation, and delivering social and environmental benefits. It is that dividend that the report has valued at $7.1tn (\u00a35.7tn).   Commenting on the report's findings, Mr Ban said climate change \"doesn't respect borders\".  \"It's an international problem that can only be solved with co-operation and collaboration, across borders and worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that in many parts of the world, our climate has already changed and we need to adapt with it.\" The report calls for \"revolutions\" in understanding, planning and finance - to \"ensure that climate impacts, risks and solutions are factored into decision-making at all levels\". Turning its recommendations into action will be the next endeavour; there will be a further announcement about adaptation plans at the  UN Climate Summit in September .

{"id":null,"body":"An inquiry into the recent massive bushfire disaster in Australia has found the country should expect \"worse\" in the years to come. The review - which looked at New South Wales (NSW), the worst-hit state - made sweeping proposals aimed at better preparing for future fire seasons. The blazes began last August and burned for months, killing 33 people nationally and scorching vast areas. The NSW state government said it would adopt the inquiry's 76 recommendations. The \"extreme and extremely unusual\" bushfires destroyed 2,476 houses and 5.5 million hectares of land in that state alone, according to  the NSW Bushfire Inquiry report . \"It showed us bushfires through forested regions on a scale that we have not seen in Australia in recorded history, and fire behaviour that took even experienced firefighters by surprise.\" The main causes were a drought which had made the land extremely dry and ready to burn, hot and windy weather, and climate change. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Tuesday: \"The next fire season is already upon us.\" As  deadly fires rage in the US summer  in California,  NSW has seen winter blazes  this month - though none have posed a significant threat. It made far-reaching proposals, including: Ms Berejiklian said: \"We have to accept also that our climate is changing and those who wrote the report acknowledge that.\" The report also noted an alarming rise in fire-generated storms -  the most dangerous type of blaze . Of the 90 recorded since the early 1980s, a third took place in the past year. Overall, most bushfires were caused by lightning strikes and embers from other blazes. There were just 11 instances of people deliberately attempting to light bushfires, reinforcing that arson was  wrongly overstated by some people  as a significant cause of the crisis. It added that this year's season was unlikely to be as severe.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Scramble across exposed rocks in the middle of Antarctica and it's possible to find the mummified twigs of shrubs that grew on the continent some three to five million years ago. This plant material isn't much to look at, but scientists say it should serve as a warning to the world about where climate change could take us if carbon emissions go unchecked. The time period is an epoch geologists call the Pliocene, 2.6-5.3 million years ago.  It was marked by temperatures that were significantly warmer than today, perhaps by 2-3 degrees globally.  These were conditions that permitted plant growth even in the middle of the White Continent.  Higher, too, were sea-levels. It's uncertain by how much, but possibly in the region of 10-20m above the modern ocean surface. What's really significant, though, is that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was very similar to what it is today - at around 400 CO2 molecules for every million molecules of air. Indeed, the Pliocene was the last time in Earth history that the air carried this same concentration of the greenhouse gas. And it tells you where we're heading if we don't get serious about addressing the climate problem, cautions Prof Martin Siegert from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. This video can not be played Temperatures may currently be lower than in the Pliocene, but that's only because there is a lag in the system, he says. \"If you put your oven on at home and set it to 200C, the temperature doesn't get to that level immediately; it takes a bit of time,\" he told reporters.  \"And it's the same with Earth's climate. If you ratchet up the level of CO2 at 400 parts per million (ppm), it won't suddenly get to an equilibrium overnight. It will take maybe 300 years or something.  \"So, the question to us is: what is the equilibrium state; what is Earth's climate going to look like with 400ppm, all things being settled?\" Prof Siegert was among  a group of scientists meeting in London on Wednesday  to discuss the climate lessons from the Pliocene.  These experts want to see much more research into the parallels between then and now. A lot of the knowledge we have presently about the epoch comes from ocean sediments.  These muds, drilled off the coast of Antarctica, contain fossil organisms whose geochemistry can be used to reconstruct ancient temperatures and the corresponding likely volume of ice on the planet.  If, as the scientists suspect, sea-levels were 10-20m higher in the Pliocene, it indicates the ice sheets must also have looked very different. \"The Greenland Ice Sheet holds about 7m (equivalent of sea-level rise). That was probably gone,\" said Imperial's Prof Tina van De Flierdt. \"In Antarctica, we have the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet which holds about 5m. That was probably gone, too. \"And then we have the big chunk in East Antarctica. There are certain parts of that which people have believed to be stable for a very long time. But that kind of doesn't work with the numbers. If we need more than 10m of sea level rise, we need East Antarctica to be unstable as well.\" This could certainly explain the presence of plants in the middle of a continent where today only lichens and mosses can survive. Prof Jane Francis, the director of the British Antarctic Survey, pulled her fossilised shrub material from rocks just 500km from the South Pole. \"These are twigs similar to southern beech,\" she told BBC News. \"I like to call them the remnants of the  last forests of Antarctica .  \"They're probably Pliocene in age. What we're looking at is a time when the glaciers retreated and we were left with areas in front of those glaciers where tiny little shrubs could grow. It wouldn't have been a nice place to live; it would have been a tundra kind of environment, but with enough sunshine in summer and temperatures (able to rise) up to about 5C.\" A key unknown is how much, how soon. How fast could Antarctica retreat in the modern era if the global climate responds to the warming forced by 400ppm? Conceivably very fast, is the answer from Prof Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  He runs computer models which incorporate physical processes in the ice that can result in the rapid collapse of cliffs at the front of Antarctic glaciers terminating in the ocean. \"Today we are measuring sea-level rise in millimetres per year. So, a little more than 3mm per year right now,\" he explained.  \"But these new processes imply the potential for centimetres per year. But we're looking to the geologists for guidance about rates. Maybe, it takes 10,000 years to get to 20m. We've still got a lot more work to do.\" For Prof Siegert, the imperative is to bring carbon emissions under control very quickly and then reverse the concentration. \"Can we restrict temperature rise to 1.5 degrees this century? Can we do that? It's possible,\" he says.  \"We've got to bring CO2 levels down to 40% of what they are today by 2030, or so. And then to zero by 2050, and then negative after that. That's a massive undertaking but it's possible.\"   Drilling climate history in 'Iceberg Alley' Big ice melt scenarios 'not plausible' Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Most climate scientists think the world is getting warmer and that humans are at least in part responsible. Almost every country in the world has pledged to make efforts to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in order to prevent dangerous \"interference with the climate system\". But exactly how to do this raises interesting questions about fairness. To discuss them, we put Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel in a state-of-the-art digital studio -  connected to 60 people in 30 countries . Here producer David Edmonds outlines three key puzzles. We have been pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in ever increasing quantities since the industrial revolution.   Some countries in the developed world are, of course, responsible for the bulk of this.  Since 1850 the US and the nations which are now the EU have been responsible for more than 50% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.   So shouldn't they pay to fix the problem?  The inhabitants of The Maldives - made up of more than 1,200 islands, most of which are no more than one metre above sea level - are already feeling the effects of climate change. They are victims.  But they didn't cause the problem.  Should those countries with historical responsibility for emissions be obliged to compensate The Maldives? The old industrialised world might respond that for much of the period since the 1850s nobody knew about man-made global warming.  Does that mitigate its responsibility?  And why should the current generation be punished for the crimes of its forebears?  Is that really fair?   Then there's the question of who's polluting now - when we do know the damage it's doing.  China belts out more CO2 than the United States, and the gap between the two is expected to grow as China continues to develop.    So perhaps it is China, not the United States, which should bear the greatest burden? Or, yet another possibility, surely the fairest solution would be a per capita arrangement?  China now emits more than the US because its population is four times the size.  But on average, each Chinese citizen is much poorer than each American, and with a much smaller environmental footprint.   These are the sorts of questions which have dogged global climate change summits.  And you can see why. One brilliantly innovative way to deal with global warming emissions is carbon trading.  Here, broadly, is the idea. Countries (or states, or companies), are given an allowance to emit a certain amount of the gases that cause climate change - CO2 for example. If a country wants to go beyond its allowance, it can buy the right to emit from other countries, which will compensate by cutting their emissions.  If this market-based system works as it's supposed to, it's an efficient and cost-effective way of cutting overall emissions. Emissions can be trimmed in countries where it's cheap to do so, rather than in countries where it's expensive and difficult.    But even if the market is effective, is its use appropriate?  Some have compared carbon trading to the Roman Catholic medieval practice of allowing individuals to pay money to reduce punishment for a sin.   A tongue-in-cheek website - cheatneutral.com - allows people who are sexually unfaithful to their partners to \"offset\" their cheating by \"finding someone else to be faithful and NOT cheat\".  Is that really what we're doing when we trade carbon?  If it works, does it matter? This video can not be played Technology is advancing at breakneck speed.  Suppose there were technological fixes for climate change and ecological damage.  In other words, suppose that we didn't need to worry about how much we consumed.  In this future world, we can carry on munching and guzzling and buying more and more at no environmental cost.   We can fly more, watch bigger televisions, generally own more stuff.   Would this be an unqualified good? To some this would be a utopia.   To others, and they include Pope Francis, it would not.    What's required, he wrote in a recent encyclical, is a complete revolution in our attitude towards the environment.  We shouldn't regard the environment as of mere instrumental value.  We should consider it with awe and wonder.  \"If we approach nature and the environment without this openness to awe and wonder\u2026 our attitude will be that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on [our] immediate needs.\"  If the Pope's right, then a scientific answer to climate change might, in one way, be a cause of regret.  It would deprive us of the incentive to change our mindset, to readjust our relationship to the countryside and wildlife.  The Global Philosopher: Should the rich world pay for climate change? is on Radio 4 at 09:00 on Thursday 28 July. You can  listen later online  or  watch the debate here . These three issues hardly exhaust the philosophy of climate change and the environment.  There are all sorts of other issues.  We might ask ourselves whether, as individuals, we have any responsibility for the future, since the impact any one of us can have is negligible.  We might wonder whether our obligation to people yet unborn is less important than our obligation to those already alive. These are all tough questions, questions which are essentially philosophical in nature.  But they're also questions we need to address, discuss and resolve, if we're to deal with climate change and its consequences.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Extreme weather events linked to climate change cost thousands of lives and caused huge damage throughout the world in 2018, say Christian Aid. The charity's  report  identified ten events that cost more than $1bn each, with four costing more than $7bn each. Scientists have shown that the chances of heat waves in Europe were influenced directly by human-related warming. Other events, say the authors, are due to shifts in weather patterns, said to be a consequence of climate change. According to the report the most financially costly disasters linked to rising temperatures were Hurricanes Florence and Michael, with costs said to be around $17bn for the former, and $15bn for the latter.  Research published at the time  showed that the rains accompanying Hurricane Florence  were made 50% worse than they would have been without human influenced warming. With Hurricane Michael, experts say that human activities drove the emissions that made the water warmer, adding fuel and speed to the storm. In Japan, 2018 was the summer of extremes with flooding and heatwaves causing huge impacts.  The floods killed at least 230 people and caused $7bn worth of damage, which were then followed by Typhoon Jebi, the most powerful storm to hit the country for 25 years. Europe also saw record heatwaves - with  researchers showing that climate change likely doubled  the chances of the events happening. A  separate study from the Met Office  looking at the UK suggested that the extreme heat  was made 30 times more likely because of rising temperatures.  The Christian Aid study says even where scientists have not done attribution studies linking events to climate change, they believe that warming is driving shifts in weather patterns that make droughts and wildfires more likely. \"Climate change is something still often talked about as a future problem, not least because we know the consequences of the warming climate are so devastating and don't want to face up to what is already happening,\" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid. \"This report shows that for many people, climate change is having devastating impacts on their lives and livelihoods right now. The great injustice of climate breakdown is that the people that suffer first and worst, are the world's poor that have done the least to contribute to the crisis.\" \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The report says that while the headline events had immediate impacts on lives and economies throughout 2018, in many developing countries there are slow-moving disasters connected to climate change such as droughts and sea encroachment that are progressively hitting millions of people.  Commenting on the Christian Aid report, Dr Michael Mann from Penn State University said the impacts of climate change were no longer subtle.  \"The unprecedented floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires and super storms we've seen in recent years - they are the face of climate change. The world's weather is becoming more extreme before our eyes - the only thing that can stop this destructive trend from escalating is a rapid fall in carbon emissions.\" According to the World Meteorological Organisation's initial observations, 2018 is likely to be the fourth warmest on record with the Earth's average temperature hovering close to 1C above the levels recorded in 1850-1900. Their  State of the Climate report , published in November, said that 20 of the warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years.  With a  high likelihood of a new El Ni\u00f1o  forming early in 2019, the coming 12 months is expected to push the current record close, with the UK  Met Office predicting  that the global average temperature for 2019 will likely be 1.10C, above the pre-industrial average period from 1850-1900.  Since 1850, 2016 is the warmest year on record with a central estimate of 1.15 \u00b0C above the same baseline. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

Falling trees damaged homes and vehicles and blocked roads across Wales after a \"danger to life\" wind warning. Nine people were rescued after a campsite flooded and six people had to be rescued from a flooded property. River searches in Cardiff  were suspended  after reports of people in the water. A weather warning for wind covered most of Wales until 09:00 BST on Wednesday, with  gusts of 75mph (120km\/h) recorded at Lake Vyrnwy , Powys, according to BBC Wales forecaster Derek Brockway. The Met Office had warned of a \"danger to life\" due to flying debris and large waves, with the possibility of homes, buildings and roads being damaged in the storm. In north Wales, firefighters had to help six people to safety after a property became flooded at Abergwyngregyn, in Gwynedd. Footage shared on Twitter showed a torrent of water passing homes.

South Wales Police said Church Street in the city centre had been  \"evacuated and will remain closed for several hours\"  due to damage caused to buildings by strong winds. Earlier on in the capital, a man was inside his restaurant when a tree crashed through the roof. Mamun Miah said he was making phone calls in the newly refurbished Lake Spice restaurant when the wind picked up. \"I saw the building start shaking and the whole tree fell down and the double doors smashed completely,\" he said, adding that no-one was hurt.\"I had two colleagues in the kitchen who started running out, they saw something had happened and saw the whole roof come down.\" Scottish Power said 3,000 of its customers in Gwynedd and Powys had been without power due to high winds. Western Power Distribution said its teams attended dozens of incidents which had left homes without electricity in Powys, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot and Caerphilly county. It said about 9,000 properties lost power on Tuesday evening across south Wales, south west England, and the Midlands. Around Cardiff, trees came down in Colchester Avenue and Boverton Street, Pen y Lan, Plasturton Gardens, Pontcanna, St Fagans Road in Fairwater, Heol Uchaf in Rhiwbina, and on Windsor Road, Penarth, in Vale of Glamorgan. In north Wales, the A55 was hit by flood water and fallen trees blocked roads near the A55 at Holywell and the A548 near Bagillt, both in Flintshire, and Mold Road in Wrexham. The A5 between Nant Ffrancon and Capel Curig in Snowdonia was closed due to a landslide, and the A55 at Llanfairfechan, Conwy county, was blocked due to flooding. Dyfed Powys Police said officers had been dealing with a \"high volume of trees and lines down\" around Brecon, and Gwent Police said a tree had blocked St Brides Road, near the M4 bridge at Magor. Earlier on Tuesday, the A4076 at Hamilton Terrace, Milford Haven was blocked by a fallen tree, while another was partially blocking the road between Clarey and Star. In Gwynedd, a tree branch came down across the A494 between Bala and Dolgellau. The M48 Severn Bridge was closed in both directions and traffic was diverted across the M4 Prince of Wales bridge. Elsewhere, fallen trees closed the A487 near the Dyfi Bridge in Gwynedd, the A4080 on Anglesey, the A4160 in Vale of Glamorgan, the A470 in Conwy, the A4042 in Torfaen, and the A4119 in Cardiff. \ud83d\udca8 #StormFrancis  17:00 Update Due to a tree blocking the railway between Bridgend and Cardiff Central the line towards Cardiff is blocked. Services running through these stations may be cancelled, delayed by up to 60 mins or diverted via Rhoose. Disruption expected until 17:45.  pic.twitter.com\/lcRlJytVBz Rail services have were also heavily disrupted across the country,  according to Transport for Wales . A tree was blocking the line between Cardiff Central and Bridgend, and a number of services were cancelled, including between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog, Ystrad Mynach and Heath High Level, Cross Keys and Ebbw Vale Town, Shrewsbury and Crewe, and Carmarthen and Swansea. Flooding also closed the line between Craven Arms and Llandrindod, with replacement services in place from Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, campers enjoying the last of their summer holiday were rescued across parts of south Wales after the flood waters rose. Firefighters used lines and wading gear to rescue nine people and two dogs from a flooded campsite in St Clears, Carmarthenshire, after river levels rose. The owner of Lakeside Leisure Campsite said everyone was safe and was now in alternative accommodation following the incident. It had only been open a month following coronavirus restrictions. Bradley, who did not give his last name, said: \"They are all fine, they're drying off. \"We couldn't have foreseen it, it was just the rainwater running down from the hills. \"This year has been dreadful, we've been able to open for a month and it has just poured down.\" Natural Resources Wales said the levels at the River Cynin were 2m above their normal levels. Campers at Llwyngwair Manor Holiday Park, in Newport, Pembrokeshire, woke to a \"frightening\" scene, its manager said. \"Within a very short period of time the river was swollen and it was time to wake the visitors,\" said Meleri Clare Ennis. \"Everything happened so quickly and I hope we're over the worst.\"\u00a0 @bbcweather   @BBCNews   @BBCWales   @BBCWalesToday  @ @BBCWalesNews   The River Twrch is high today at Upper Cwmtwrch  pic.twitter.com\/99kVC5qsnC A yellow weather warning for rain was in place for counties in mid and north Wales until 06:00 on Wednesday. A number of properties flooded in Neath, Whitland, Tonyrefail and Llanelli, while roads were closed and some trains disrupted after part of the south Wales main-line railway was left underwater. National Rail  tweeted  that the railway line at Neath had been blocked, with trains between Swansea and Cardiff cancelled or delayed.  A 30mph speed limit was in place on a number of services in south Wales, with passengers warned to expect delays due to the severe weather. Traffic Wales warned of \"extremely poor driving conditions\" and said people should plan ahead. There were  flood warnings in place along rivers in Carmarthenshire , with communities told to be prepared. There were also a number of flood alerts in place. Chepstow Racecourse said it had cancelled its scheduled races on Wednesday due to the heavy rain.

{"id":null,"body":"By Laura Wellesley Research associate, Chatham House As the Paris Conference of the Parties (COP21) draws near, the international spotlight is more focused on climate change than at any time since the Copenhagen talks of 2009.  But amid all the talk of decarbonising energy and transport systems, one crucial area remains in the shadows. The livestock sector produces about 15% of global greenhouse gases, roughly equivalent to all the exhaust emissions of every car, train, ship and aircraft on the planet.   A new report from the think tank Chatham House,  Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption , argues that without concerted action to address over-consumption of meat, it will be near impossible to prevent global warming from passing the danger level of 2C. The US has one of the highest levels of meat consumption in the world at about 250g per person per day, almost four times the amount deemed healthy by experts. Europe and the major livestock-producing nations of South America are not far behind, while, at the other end of the scale, Indians average less than 10g of meat per day. While consumption levels have plateaued in industrialised countries, there is a general correlation between wealth and diet. As incomes rise in the emerging economies, meat consumption is booming. Left unchecked, shifting diets, coupled with a growing population, would see global consumption increase by more than 75% by 2050. Very little. As of 21 October, commitments to reducing emissions from the livestock sector appear in only 21 of the 120 national plans submitted in advance of the Paris climate conference. Reducing meat consumption appears in none. Governments fear a backlash from voters over interference in such a personal choice as diet. And because public awareness of the link between diet and climate change is so low, there is very little pressure on governments to do anything about it. This \"cycle of inertia\" means dietary change continues to be a low policy priority despite its importance. Yes. Even though COP21 is highlighting the need for climate action and, though a deal seems likely, the pledges made in advance of the summit would put us on a path to warming of about 3C by the end of the century, leaving much work to be done if we are to get to 2C.   But reining in excessive meat consumption could close the gap by as much as a quarter and will represent an attractive strategy for governments in need of credible and affordable solutions. Moreover, with excessive meat consumption now  in the headlines for health reasons , there has never been a better time to act.  Governments should seize this opportunity. This video can not be played The first priority is to increase public awareness - both to allow people to make informed choices about what they eat and to build support for further action.  But it is clear that information campaigns alone will not suffice.   Governments should use the full range of policy levers available to them. Changing the food served in public organisations - to offer a greater share of vegetarian and vegan options - would provide a boost to sustainable suppliers and issue a powerful signal to the millions of people who eat in public offices, schools, the armed forces, hospitals and prisons.  Price reform will also be needed to reflect environmental costs and incentivise behaviour change at the scale needed.  Focus groups carried out by Chatham House in four countries suggested that as long as the public could see a strong rationale for change, they would come to accept government intervention on diets.  What's more, the public appears to expect that governments will take action in the public good. With a strong enough signal from governments and the media about why we need to change our eating habits, the public is likely to come to accept initially unpopular policies.  History also provides grounds for optimism in this regard. Awareness-raising and price reforms have been successful in shifting our behaviour in terms of smoking and drinking.  Laura Wellesley is a research associate at the think tank  Chatham House . This article is based on a new Chatham House report  Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption  by Laura Wellesley, Catherine Happer and Antony Froggatt. COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Can we trust the silver bullet of technology to fix climate change? The prime minister seems to think so. In a speech due soon, he is expected to pledge his faith in offshore wind power, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen, clean cars, and zero-emission aviation.  Clean technologies are clearly a huge part of any solution. But the PM is being accused of techno-optimism bias, because he does not mention other key factors in reducing emissions. In fact, experts say, tackling climate change will need action right across society and the economy - with a host of new incentives, laws, rules, bans, appliance standards, taxes and institutional innovations. They also warn that citizens\u2019 behaviour must shift, with people probably driving and flying less, and eating less meat and dairy produce. In other words, when it comes to cutting carbon emissions, there\u2019s no silver bullet \u2013 it\u2019s more like silver buckshot. But Boris Johnson still seems to have a bandolero stuffed with technologies resembling silver bullets. Let\u2019s see whether they\u2019ll go with a bang. Take cars. The prime minister is due to accelerate the transition towards battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicles. But Professor Jillian Anable from Leeds University warns that even electric cars pose \"their own problems that politicians seem reluctant to acknowledge.\" \u201cProducing electricity and hydrogen requires huge numbers of wind farms or the like, and the cars themselves need resource-hungry tyres, and batteries. \"They also need roads and parking spaces that could otherwise be used for gardens and trees that soak up carbon dioxide,\" she said. \u201cThe harsh reality is that we have to find ways to limit the number of cars and the amount that we drive them\u201d  There is  widespread agreement that hydrogen will play a role  in reducing climate change \u2013 but how much, and in what industrial sectors, is another matter. A key question is whether it\u2019s sourced from natural gas \u2013 which is expensive and, depending on the process used, can yield troublesome carbon dioxide as a by-product - or by using surplus wind energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The latter process does the job cleanly but at still greater cost. Jess Ralston, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said: \u201cHydrogen can power cars, but electricity seems to have won that technology race.  It could heat homes, but electric heat pumps are emerging as a better bet.  \u201cHydrogen could be really useful, though, in industries such as steelmaking and in heavy transport \u2013 including buses that we\u2019re already seeing. But it\u2019s no silver bullet.\u201d On aviation, the prime minister has launched his ambition to devise clean planes. He calls the project  \u201cjet zero\u201d . Industry figures appreciate his boosterish support, but critics warn \"jet zero\" mustn\u2019t divert attention from the short-term need for rules and taxes to hold down aviation emissions after Covid. Cait Hewitt from the Aviation Environment Federation told us: \u201cNo zero-carbon technology options are currently available for commercial aviation.  She explains: \"Planes use masses of energy. Batteries aren\u2019t powerful enough except for tiny planes, and we can only produce biofuels sustainably in small quantities.  \u201cWe need a major rollout of radical new technologies, and we need the capacity to remove remaining aircraft emissions from the atmosphere. But she says that \u201cgiven how far we are from delivering these things, we\u2019ll also probably need to fly less.\u201d  UK governments have agonised for decades about nuclear energy, but Boris Johnson recently gave it the nod.  That means he\u2019s likely to either agree a financial package for  a new station at Sizewell  or for small modular reactors, or both.  But nuclear is still a divisive issue. While it \"could definitely help to reduce emissions,\" said Professor Jim Watson, from UCL, \"it\u2019s very expensive.\" \u201cTo play a major role, the cost of new nuclear plants will really need to fall, especially when the costs of other technologies like wind and solar have dropped so far.  \u201cAnd nuclear developers will need to show that they can build their plants more quickly because we need  all  electricity to be low carbon within the next 10 years.\u201d  He agreed that  mini reactors might bring down costs  \u2013 but said it was far too soon to be certain. The prime minister has professed himself \u201can evangelist\" for the technology that captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted from factories and power stations and either stores it in underground rocks or uses it for new chemicals. Two decades ago it was touted as a climate saviour, but it's very expensive and has never taken off.   The main climate authority, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the technology must be used to capture the emissions from trees being burned for energy. This way, the plants suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and the emissions are buried - helping to turn climate change into reverse. It's known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). But the IPCC's Professor Jim Skea says there are \"potential problems.\" He explained: \"If the trees are grown on land that would otherwise be used for producing food then there are problems with food security. And if we plant acres and acres of land with the same type of tree there are implications for wildlife.\u201d So much for silver bullets. But what about the silver buckshot I mentioned earlier? Well, a long list of policies requires government attention, including: standards for new homes;  green recovery ; food production;  planning rules ; peat; heat and buildings; meat eating; infrastructure statement; road building;  carbon dioxide in soil ; medium-term emissions targets; tree planting;   energy storage ; industrial strategy;  appliance standards;  and the comprehensive spending review. I\u2019ll examine some of the non-technology innovations for tackling climate change in a future article.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Older, carbon-rich tropical forests continue to be lost at a frightening rate, according to satellite data.  In 2019, an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds, the  University of Maryland  study of trees more than 5 metres  says. Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires. However, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo both managed to reduce tree loss. Meanwhile, Australia saw a sixfold rise in total tree loss, following dramatic wildfires late in 2019, . As well as storing massive amounts of carbon, primary, tropical rainforests, where trees can be hundreds or even thousands of years old, are home to species such as orangutans and tigers. The tropics lost 11.9 million hectares (46,000 square miles) of tree cover, the study found, 3.8 million in older, primary forest areas - the third highest loss of primary trees since 2000 and a slight increase on 2018. \"The level of forest loss that we saw in 2019 is unacceptable,\" Frances Seymour, from the World Resources Institute, said.  \"And one of the reasons that it's unacceptable is that we actually already know how to turn it around. \"If governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down.  \"But if governments relax restrictions on burning, or [are] signalling that they intend to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploration, forest loss goes up.\" Speaking about the losses in Brazil, Mikaela Weisse, from Global Forest Watch, said: \"We also noted several new hotspots of primary forest loss within indigenous territories, especially in the state of Par\u00e1 that were linked to land grabbing and to mining. \"These incursions are particularly worrisome given that indigenous peoples have been some of the best conservers of forests in Brazil and around the world.\" Indonesia, however, saw losses remain at historically low levels for the third year in a row, thanks, it seems, to strong government action. Liz Goldman, from Global Forest Watch, said: \"A number of policies in Indonesia have contributed to this positive story, including increased enforcement to prevent forest fires and land clearing and a forest moratorium to prevent new clearing for oil palm plantations and logging activities, which was first established in 2011 and made permanent just this past year.\"  And Columbia, which had seen tree losses surge since a peace agreement came into force in 2016, saw a 35% drop in primary forest loss compared with 2018. But Bolivia saw losses 80% greater than any other year, after fires set for agricultural clearing spread out of control.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg has made a passionate speech to world leaders at the UN, accusing them of failing to act on climate change.  \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she told a UN climate summit in New York. About 60 world leaders are taking part in the one-day meeting organised by UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.  He earlier said countries could only speak at the summit if they came with action plans to cut carbon emissions.  US President Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, had not been expected at the meeting - but he was briefly spotted in the audience. Brazil and Saudi Arabia are among the countries staying away. In an emotional speech, she said: \"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" the 16-year-old said. And she urged world leaders to act urgently, saying: \"We will be watching you.\" This video can not be played Mr Guterres, who organised the meeting, said the world was \"in a deep climate hole\" and that urgent action was needed. \"Time is running out, but it's not too late,\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would double to \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn; $4.4bn) it financial commitment to fight global warming. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron said international organisations had pledged to release $500m in additional aid to protect tropical forests. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said things \"are starting to turn around\" in the country. \"Our gross emissions peaked in 2006, over 80% of our electricity already comes from renewable hydro and wind, and we have begun an ambitious agenda.  \"We have introduced in parliament the zero carbon bill, the purpose of which is to ensure New Zealand lives within the threshold of 1.5C of global warming necessary to avoid catastrophic weather events for our Pacific neighbours.\" The summit comes days after several million people took part in a global climate strike led by youth activists. Ahead of the meeting, scientists warned the signs and impacts of global warming were speeding up. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said  the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2019 had grown by 20%  compared with the previous five years. \"We should listen to the loud cry coming from the schoolchildren,\" said Professor Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and professor of meteorology at the University of Reading. \"There is an emergency - one for action in both rapidly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions towards zero and adapting to the inevitable changes in climate,\" he said. By Roger Harrabin,  BBC environment analyst  As the dangers of climate heating become ever more apparent, so does the absence of collective will to tackle the issue. In 2015 in Paris, all the world's leaders sounded their determination to curb the emissions that were heating the climate. The summit will see a host of initiatives from businesses and small- and medium-sized nations. This video can not be played But President Trump is encouraging fossil fuel use in every way he can.  And China - in spite of its trend-setting commitment to solar and wind power -  is still building new coal-fired power stations. Even the UK, a global leader in climate policy-making, is veering away from its own medium-term targets to cut emissions. The government is still aiming to expand Heathrow airport and increase the road network in a way that will increase emissions in those sectors. Politicians appear to believe climate change can be challenged with a version of economic business as usual.  Their scientists are telling them with increasing desperation that we humans are facing an unprecedented threat in need of an unprecedented response.

{"id":null,"body":"\"The moment of crisis has come\" in efforts to tackle climate change, Sir David Attenborough has warned.  He spoke as  BBC News launched a year of special coverage on global warming. Here are our answers to a range of readers' questions. Climate change will need to be tackled by governments worldwide,  through measures like the 2005 Kyoto Protocol.  This brought nations together for the first time in a single agreement on tackling climate change. But everyone has a carbon footprint. This is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide - which contributes to global warming - released into the atmosphere by people's actions. This can be reduced in a number of ways.  According to a recent report by a group of international scientists,   transport is responsible for 34% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling. Home heating presents another challenge and opportunity. It is responsible for 21% of a household's carbon footprint.  This could be cut by turning down the thermostat, having better-insulated houses and changing to low-carbon heating systems. According to the United Nations,  the current world population is about 7.7 billion and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050. This population growth drives higher demand for food, greater energy consumption and more competition for resources. And it increases the production of the gases that cause global warming. And  a recent major study,  by a global group of 11,000 scientists, concluded that the world needs to stabilise its population. The study has attracted quite a deal of controversy, but its authors say such action is needed if the world is to avoid what they call \"a catastrophic threat\" from climate change. However, not everyone agrees about the impact population growth has on climate change. Some argue, for example, that a focus on reducing individual carbon footprints would be a much effective strategy than seeking to stabilise population growth.  It is estimated that 26% of global emissions come from food and more than half of this from animal products.   This is because producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Cows and sheep also produce methane - a greenhouse gas. According to a 2019 report by UN experts , switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. But they stopped short of advising people to become vegan or vegetarian. And  a University of Oxford study  found that if everybody on Earth cut meat and dairy from their diet, there could be a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production.  China and the US are the world's largest emitters of CO2, responsible for 16,000 megatonnes between them a year. In terms of emissions per head of population, the picture is different. The US is still near the top, with 15.53 tonnes. But the UK (5.99 tonnes) is only slightly behind China (6.59 tonnes). So what can a smaller country, like the UK, do to exert pressure for change? On an individual level, consumers could decide to seek out \"green\" products and boycott ones from more polluting parts of the world, says Alyssa Gilbert, climate policy director at Imperial College London. There is also an opportunity for the UK to come up with innovative ideas that larger countries might adopt, Ms Gilbert suggests. \"As a country we are small and nimble, so we can pilot ideas around technology and policy in the hope that we can export them to other countries\", she says. At government level, the UK can also use diplomacy, as well as international aid, to bring about change. Carbon capture, to remove and store greenhouse gases, already happens naturally. All plants and trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and groundwater. So, planting trees is seen as an important weapon in the fight against global warming.  The UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says significant rises in tree planting \"need to happen quickly\" if other targets to cut carbon are not met. It says 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted in 2018. The UK government says it is  committed to planting 11 million trees  by 2022. In February 2019, the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, became the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning. Another approach, currently being offered by a company in Switzerland, is to  pull carbon dioxide directly from the air . This gas can then be sold for other purposes, like being used to grow vegetables in hi-tech greenhouses. But schemes like these are, as yet, relatively few and small-scale.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor Is it remotely feasible to remove 12 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air? Every year. For decades to come. That's the challenge posed by the latest conclusions of the UN's climate science panel. It says that only by pulling this heat-trapping gas out of the atmosphere can we avoid dangerous climate change. But according to one leading researcher, there's a bit of a hitch: \"We haven't a clue how to do it\". The problem is that scientists reckon that even if the world manages to cut emissions of the gas, it will no longer be enough to avoid the worst impacts.  We've got to go a step further, they say, and find ways of doing something never attempted before: get rid of the gas that's already out there.  And get started on it as soon as possible. On an unimaginable scale. The most headline-grabbing solution is for  giant machines to filter the air and strip out the gas , as my colleague Matt McGrath has reported. But although the costs are falling, they remain very high and many wonder whether it's feasible to plaster the planet with so much hardware. Forests do the job of soaking up carbon dioxide, because the trees need it to grow, but if they're left to rot or are burned, the gas will be released back out again. There are schemes for fertilising the oceans to encourage plankton to flourish, absorb CO\u2082 and drag it to the ocean floor - but there are risks of unintended consequences.   Yet another avenue is to mimic a geological process known as weathering, in which rocks are broken down in a chemical reaction that draws carbon dioxide from the air.  This happens all the time naturally but took off in spectacular fashion more than 400 million years ago.  In an ancient chain reaction, as land-based plants evolved to become larger, it's believed their roots sought to extract more mineral nutrients from the rocks, eroding them and exposing them to the air.  That in turn led to a massive reduction in CO\u2082 in the atmosphere. Could the same effect be repeated? Prof David Beerling hopes so.  A scientist at Sheffield University, he's leading a ten-year project with a \u00a310m budget from the  Leverhulme Trust  to investigate the climate potential of rock.  The concept is to take the volcanic rock basalt, grind it up into a powder and then scatter it on fields.  Trials on a research farm in Illinois have found that the basalt acts as a fertiliser, boosting crop yields, which might help persuade farmers to use it instead of high-carbon artificial fertiliser.  And early results from smaller experiments in Prof Beerling's lab in Sheffield show a more profound benefit: that the presence of the rock in the soil also boosts the amount of carbon dioxide that's taken up, maybe by as much as four times.  As part of the project, trials using basalt have started in Malaysia and Australia to see how different environments affect the results. The vision is for the biggest emitters such as the US, China and Brazil to take this up, use basalt on their vast agri-businesses and - ideally - soak up a few billion tonnes of CO\u2082. Prof Beerling knows that some regard this as over-optimistic but he is clear that a grand strategy is needed. \"Once CO\u2082 goes up into the air, it doesn't come down unless you do something about it, and the effects last for millennia. And once the ice sheets go, that's it,\" with millions of people living on or close to coastlines at risk.  \"At the moment we have no idea how to remove billions of tonnes of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere\u2026 it's an enormous technological challenge that dwarfs anything we've seen before.\" If it all had to be freshly dug up, the environmental cost might doom the idea from the start.  But the industrial age has cleared billions of tonnes of the right kind of rock from open-cast mines and has also generated massive amounts of \"slag\" - waste from iron and steel production - which could also be used. The practical challenges are obviously immense. But the slag itself, which historically was dumped unwanted in mountainous heaps, is surprisingly good at trapping CO\u2082.  Dr Phil Renforth of Cardiff University has been gathering samples from some forgotten corners of Britain's industrial heritage. I joined him on a dark hillside in south Wales.  \"Globally we produce half a billion tonnes of slag around the world,\" he said, \"and that could capture something on the order of a quarter of a billion tonnes of CO\u2082. \"So it's not going to do everything but it might be relevant for us.\"  That's a question that usually produces shrugs. Too little is known at this stage.  I ask Prof Beerling when the basalt-spraying technique might be in use, assuming it's eventually proven to work on a large scale. \"The infrastructure for farmers to deploy basalt on their crops is already in place. If proven safe and effective, it might be deployable within a decade or two,\" he says. Yet all the time, even more CO\u2082 is being added to the atmosphere - and with few options for reversing it.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The world's peatlands will become a large source of greenhouse gases as temperatures rise this century, say scientists. Right now, huge amounts of carbon are stored in boggy, often frozen regions stretching across northern parts of the world. But much of the permanently frozen land will thaw this century, say experts. This will release warming gases at a rate that could be 30-50% greater than previous estimates.  Stretching across vast regions of the northern half of the world, peatlands play an important role in the global climate system.  Over thousands of years, they have accumulated large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, which has helped keep the Earth cool. Scientists, though, are keenly aware that peatlands - including the nearly half that are permanently frozen - are very vulnerable to rising temperatures.  But, until now, a lack of accurate maps has made it difficult to fully estimate the impact of climate on peat. Using data compiled from more than 7,000 field observations, the authors of this new study were able to generate the most accurate maps to date of the peatlands, their depth and the amount of warming gases they contain.  They show that the boggy terrain covers 3.7 million sq kilometres (1.42 million sq miles). The researchers say the northern peatlands store around 415 gigatonnes of carbon. That's roughly equivalent to 46 years of current global CO2 emissions.  In their study, the authors projected that the peatlands would become a major source of CO2 as the world warms up.  One key question is when this will happen. \"Unfortunately, we cannot put exact times to these numbers so far, the models are not that advanced yet,\" said lead author Gustaf Hugelius from Stockholm University, Sweden. \"But my best estimate is that this shift will occur in the second half of this century.\" So what would be the likely impact of this thawing? The report authors say that their new estimate of the carbon emitted through thawing, and from losses of peat into rivers and streams, is 30-50% greater than in previous projections of carbon losses from permafrost thawing. If this new peatland estimate is included with all the estimates for permafrost melting, it is projected to equal the annual emissions of the EU and UK by 2100. \"The only way to limit the permafrost carbon feedback is to reduce global warming,\" said Dr Hugelius. \"Because the Arctic warms twice as fast as the rest of the globe, the higher warming pathways that we are on now are devastating for the permanently frozen parts of the globe.\" While the future for peatlands frozen or otherwise, in a warmer world is undeniably difficult. it is not without hope. Experts say that with the right investment to protect and restore non-frozen peatlands, the bogs can continue to soak up and store large amounts of CO2.  Similarly, as frozen peat thaws out it starts to become capable of growing plants and storing warming gases.  While the new study says it might take a couple of centuries for peatlands to start absorbing large amounts of CO2, others believe it might happen much sooner., \"If the climate warms and the conditions are better for the vegetation, vegetation can respond in a matter of decades,\" said Clifton Bain, who is the director of the  IUCN UK Peatland Programme . \"We've seen in the UK when you destroy a peatland and rip away the surface vegetation and drain it, if you re-wet it and there's a source of sphagnum moss there, they will re grow within a matter of decades. So, it is possible in the right conditions for the bulk vegetation to recover very quickly.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Street protests demanding urgent action on climate change have attracted hundreds of thousands of marchers in more than 2,000 locations worldwide. The People's Climate March is campaigning for curbs on carbon emissions, ahead of the UN climate summit in New York next week.  In Manhattan, organisers said some 310,000 people joined a march that was also attended by UN chief Ban Ki-moon. Earlier, huge demonstrations took place in Australia and Europe. \"This is the planet where our subsequent generations will live,\" Mr Ban told reporters. \"There is no 'Plan B' because we do not have 'Planet B'.\" The UN Secretary General was accompanied by primatologist Jane Goodall and the French Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal. New York hosted the largest of Sunday's protests, drawing more than half of the 600,000 marchers estimated by organisers to have taken part in rallies around the world. Manhattan echoed to the sound of chants, horns and drums as the colourful protest progressed through the streets. Organisers of the Manhattan event said it surpassed the largest previous protest on climate change. They said the massive mobilisation was aimed at transforming climate change \"from an environmental concern to an everybody issue\". Business leaders, environmentalists and celebrities joined the demonstration. Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio also took part, having been appointed as a UN representative on climate change last week.  Another protest, another climate conference - will this time be any different? Well, the marches brought more people on to the streets than ever before, partly thanks to the organisational power of the e-campaign group Avaaz. And the climate talks will also be influenced by technology, as it was reported this week that the sun and wind can often generate power as cheaply as gas in the home of fossil fuels, Texas. Certainly the UN's Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, hopes that he can make a fresh start in the endless blame-your-neighbour round of climate talks. Next year world leaders are due to show up in Paris to settle a global climate deal based not on a bitterly-contested chiselling negotiation in the middle of the night, but on open co-operative offers of action to tackle a shared problem. Mr Ban has invited leaders to New York to make their offers public. Some small nations will doubtless make new contributions to the carbon contraction effort as they realise the vulnerability of their own economies to a hotter world. But some big players may continue the game of climate poker, holding back their offers until they see what else is on the table. So there is no guarantee that Ban's idea will work - but at least for weary climate politics watchers it will be a change. The New York rally was part of a global protest that included events in 156 countries - Afghanistan, the UK, Italy and Brazil among them.   On Tuesday, the UN will host a climate summit at its headquarters in New York with 125 heads of state and government - the first such gathering since the unsuccessful climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Mr Ban hopes leaders can make progress on a universal agreement to be signed by all nations at the end of 2015.

{"id":null,"body":"By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent, BBC News  Scientists in Cambridge plan to set up a research centre to develop new ways to repair the Earth's climate. It will investigate radical approaches such as refreezing the Earth's poles and removing CO2 from the atmosphere. The centre is being created because of fears that current approaches will not on their own stop dangerous and irreversible damage to the planet.  The initiative is the first of its kind in the world and could lead to dramatic reductions in carbon emissions. The initiative is co-ordinated by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. \"What we do over the next 10 years will determine the future of humanity for the next 10,000 years. There is no major centre in the world that would be focused on this one big issue,\" he told BBC News.  Some of the approaches described by Sir David are often known collectively as geoengineering. The Centre for Climate Repair is part of Cambridge university's Carbon Neutral Futures Initiative, led by Dr Emily Shuckburgh. She, said the initiative's mission would be to \"solve the climate problem\". \"It has to be. And we can't fail on it,\" she said.  It will bring together scientists and engineers with social scientists.  \"This really is one of the most important challenges of our time, and we know we need to be responding to it with all our efforts,\" Dr Shuckburgh told BBC News. One of the most promising ideas for refreezing the poles is to \"brighten\" the clouds above them.  The idea is to pump seawater up to tall masts on uncrewed ships through very fine nozzles.  This produces tiny particles of salt which are injected into the clouds, which makes them more widespread and reflective, and so cool the areas below them. Another new approach is a variant of an idea called carbon capture and storage (CCS).  CCS involves collecting carbon dioxide emissions from coal or gas fired power stations or steel plants and storing it underground.  Prof Peter Styring, of the University of Sheffield, is developing a carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) pilot scheme with Tata Steel in Port Talbot in South Wales which effectively recycles CO2. The scheme involves setting up a plant on-site which converts the firm's carbon emissions into fuel using the plant's waste heat, according to Prof Styring. \"We have a source of hydrogen, we have a source of carbon dioxide, we have a source of heat and we have a source of renewable electricity from the plant,\" he told BBC News. \"We're going to harness all those and we're going to make synthetic fuels.\" Other ideas the centre would explore include greening the oceans so they can take up more CO2.  Such schemes involve fertilising the sea with iron salts which promote the growth of plankton.  Previous experiments have shown that they don't take up sufficient CO2 to make the scheme worthwhile  and might disrupt the ecosystem.  But according to Prof Callum Roberts of York University, approaches that are currently thought beyond the pale now have to be considered and, if possible, made to work. This is because the alternative of damaging and potentially irreversible climate change is considered beyond the pale. \"Early in my career, people threw their hands up in horror at suggestions of more interventionist solutions to fix coral reefs,\" Prof Roberts said. \"Now they are looking in desperation at an ecosystem that will be gone at the end of the century and now all options are on the table\". The options include genetically engineering heat-resistant coral or dumping chemicals into the sea to make the sea less acidic. \"At the moment, I happen to think that harnessing nature to mitigate climate change is a better way to go. But I do see the legitimacy of exploring [more radical] options as a means of steering us towards a better future,\" Prof Roberts said. Such ideas have many potential downsides and may prove to be unfeasible. But Peter Wadhams, a professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, said that they should be properly assessed to see if the downsides can be overcome, because he believes that reduction of CO2 emissions on its own won't be enough. \"If we reduce our emissions all we are doing is making the global climate warmer a bit more slowly. That is no good because it's already too warm and we have already got too much CO2 in the atmosphere,\" Prof Wadhams said.  \"So climate repair can actually take it out of the atmosphere. We can get the level down below what it is now and actually cool the climate bringing it back to what it was before global warming,\" he added.

{"id":null,"body":"The White House has sought to downplay a major climate change report, which was compiled by 13 US federal agencies.  The study is at odds with assertions from President Donald Trump and several members of his administration.  It says it is \"extremely likely\" human activity is the \"dominant cause\" of global warming.  A spokesman for the White House said it supported \"rigorous scientific analysis and debate\" but added that the climate was \"always changing\".  White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said it was not certain how sensitive the Earth's climate was to greenhouse gas emissions.  Mr Trump, who has embarked on a tour of Asia, once said the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese  in order to make American manufacturing  less competitive.  Earlier this year, he announced he was pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement to cut global emissions. The Climate Science Special Report, which was approved by the White House, was compiled by US government scientists. It argues that it is \"extremely likely\" that human activity is causing rapid global warming with dire consequences for the US and the world.  The scientists' predictions include: Running to nearly 500 pages, the report concludes that the current period is \"now the warmest in the history of modern civilisation\".  It is \"extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause\", it finds, adding that \"there is no convincing alternative explanation\". President Trump has made it easier for industry to pollute and he has appointed to key government positions men who are sceptical of their own scientists, the BBC's James Cook, in Los Angeles, says. Only on Thursday,  Mr Trump's Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, told US media that while he thought climate change was real and humans had an \"impact on it\", he still thought \"the science [was] out  on\" whether humans cause 100% of it. The researchers say there was no political interference in, or censorship of, their report.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK should lead the global fight against climate change by cutting greenhouse gases to nearly zero by 2050, a report says. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains this can be done at no added cost from previous estimates. Its report says that if other countries follow the UK, there\u2019s a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Some say the proposed 2050 target for near-zero emissions is too soft, but others will fear the goal could damage the UK's economy. The CCC - the independent adviser to government on climate change - said it would not be able to hit \u201cnet zero\u201c emissions any sooner, but 2050 was still an extremely significant goal. The main author Chris Stark told me: \u201cThis report would have been absolutely inconceivable just a few years ago. People would have laughed us out of court for suggesting that the target could be so high.\u201d The main change, he said, was the huge drop in the cost of renewable energy prompted by government policies to nurture solar and wind power. He said the BBC's David Attenborough climate documentary,  protests by Extinction Rebellion  and speeches by the  teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg  had persuaded the public that the problem needed urgent action. But Mr Stark said there was no way the 2050 target would be achieved unless the government backed it with policies and money. He noted that the UK was already slipping away from a legal obligation to cut its emissions step-by-step between now and 2032. This video can not be played The cost of the new proposal, the CCC estimates, is tens of billions of pounds a year and may reach to 1-2% of national wealth (as measured by GDP) each year by 2050. That doesn\u2019t count the benefits of decarbonisation - such as cleaner air and water. The CCC said England can eliminate emissions by 2050, while  Scotland could go carbon-free sooner - by 2045 . Scotland has exceptional potential for planting trees (which absorb carbon dioxide) and is more suited for carbon capture and storage. Wales can only cut 95% of its emissions by 2050  because of its farm industry.  Northern Ireland will follow England\u2019s targets . The government is studying the report, which has substantial implications for public finances, and says it \"sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely\". The plan is for \u201cnet zero\u201c emissions by 2050, which means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal. In practice, we'll need to slash the amount of CO2 we put in the atmosphere.  Unavoidable emissions need to be captured and stored (for example, where CO2 is collected from a power station chimney and put underground) or offset by planting trees. Until now, the target had been to reduce emissions by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. The CCC believes that achieving zero emissions depends on low-carbon technologies and changes to industry, and public behaviour. Here are some of the report's recommendations for the public. Home heating The report has one controversial recommendation: to turn down the home thermostat to 19C in winter.  We will need to insulate our homes much better. Some of us will use heat pumps - a sort of reverse refrigeration technology that sucks warmth from the ground - and convert natural gas boilers to hydrogen ones. The committee expects consumer bills to rise at first, then fall as a newer, cheaper electricity generators are introduced.  Flying The aviation industry is trying to bring down the cost of making jet fuels from waste materials. But the CCC says this won\u2019t be enough. The number of flights we take is increasing, and the report predicts that government action will be needed to constrain the growth. However, it doesn\u2019t say how \u2013 and the committee chair, John Gummer, ducked a question about Heathrow expansion at the report's launch. Cars The report says we won't need to overhaul our motoring habits, but eventually we will be driving electric cars. The government has set a target date of 2040 beyond which conventional car sales will be banned. However,  the committee says that deadline should be 2030 . Meat  The committee notes many people are already eating less red meat for the health of the planet and themselves.  It says people can reduce their diet-related emissions by 35% if they transition from a high-meat diet to a low-meat one. But it only predicts a 20% drop in meat consumption by 2050. Waste Bio-degradable waste should not be sent to landfill after 2025. This means we would all be obliged to separate our food waste from other rubbish. The report recommends reducing food waste as far as possible. This video can not be played The CCC says people can also take the following steps: The big push is to decarbonise industry and heat generation. Carbon capture technology will be needed on many of the major emitters: the steel, paper, aluminium and paper industries.  Agriculture is a major emitter of greenhouse gases through sheep and cattle burping methane, and from fertilisers.  Farmers would need to reduce the amount of land in pasture, increase woodland, and feed cattle food that creates less methane gas. The fracking industry would also be affected - the committee says we should only use fracked gas in the UK if it replaces gas that would otherwise be imported. Environmental groups are supportive - although many think 2050 is too conservative. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations but \"adopt a net-zero target before 2050\".  Lorna Greenwood of Extinction Rebellion told me: \"2050 condemns us to a bleak future... Others are already dying round the world thanks to inaction and far-off target setting.\" The environmental campaign group WWF has said: \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve been acting as if we have time. But if we want a world with coral reefs, safe coastal cities and enough food for everyone, we must act now.\" Business and industry groups have expressed support but argue they need government help. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said: \u201cThe UK should do all it can to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. What we need now is a supportive and timely response from the government to enact this ambitious target.\"  Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger Meanwhile, Minette Batters, president of the farm union NFU, told me: \u201cWe take the climate issue very seriously. With Brexit and the government\u2019s Agriculture Bill the government can shift farm support towards helping farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d   Meanwhile, Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of The Royal Institution, said: \u201cI am a massive supporter of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But he added: \"Will people be prepared to set their winter time thermostat to 19C? Asking people to put up with a reduction in comfort\/quality is going to be difficult.\"  Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The heads of two major central banks have written a stark warning about the financial risks of climate change. Bank of England governor Mark Carney and France's Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau set out the dangers to the global economy in an open letter. \"If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\" they wrote. The letter was co-signed by the chair of the climate-focused Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The NGFS is a coalition of 34 central banks which was formed in 2017, with the Bank of England as a founding member. It released its first major report into climate-related financial risks on 17 April. In the letter published by the Bank of England on Wednesday,  Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau describe \"the catastrophic effects of climate change\"  already having an impact on the planet, such as \"blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia\". They say that \"these events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth\". The NGFS elaborates in its \"call to action\" report, saying that climate change will lead to  \"disruptive events such as mass migration, political instability and conflict\" . This is why world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement in 2015 and committed to reducing their respective countries' carbon emissions, the letter continues, in order to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. \"But this transition brings its own risks,\" they add. The NGFS sets out three climate-related financial risks that companies, banks and governments need to fight against. It is the second risk in particular - of switching to a green economy without proper planning - that Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau focus on in their letter. \"Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital,\" it reads. The full NGFS report adds that \"while urgent action is desirable, an abrupt transition could also have an impact on financial stability and the economy more broadly\". \"The speed and timing of the transition is crucial,\" it continues. \"An orderly scenario, with clear policy signalling, would allow adequate time for existing infrastructure to be replaced and for technological progress to keep energy costs at a reasonable level. \"In contrast, a disorderly, sudden, uncoordinated, unanticipated or discontinuous transition would be disruptive and costly, particularly for those sectors and regions that are more vulnerable to structural change.\" Companies and industries that do not adjust or properly plan for these changes, Mr Carney and Mr Villeroy de Galhau say, \"will fail to exist\". They suggest that companies \"integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management\". In simpler terms - businesses need to make climate change planning an everyday thing. They also say that central banks should \"lead by example\" by making their own operations more sustainable. But most importantly, they call for more collaboration within the financial sector, with different companies and bodies sharing information about how they are dealing with these climate risks. \"An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration,\" they write.  The NGFS has also called for regulators to come up with a classification system that shows exactly \"which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy\". \"We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious,\" they add.  \"The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play.\" Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Is this the world's most eco-friendly school?

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen  Briggs BBC Environment correspondent, Bonn, Germany International talks in Bonn have made progress towards a new global deal on climate change, says the UN, amid calls from NGOs for a faster pace. Countries are working towards options to limit greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 in time for a crunch Paris summit. The UN said progress had been made towards streamlining the text of a new agreement at talks in Bonn. Environmental groups said ''difficult issues'' such as finance and emissions cuts had yet to be addressed. The 11-day meeting is designed to pave the way towards a new global deal on climate change to be signed in Paris at the end of the year. Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said ''step-by-step progress'' had been made towards countries' understanding of the text of the agreement and how to move forward. Laurence Tubiana, special representative for the Paris climate conference, said the talks had been useful and had gained the trust of parties. ''I'm feeling optimistic after these two weeks,'' she said. ''We should not be frustrated and disappointed.'' However, The World Resources Institute said progress had been ''slow'' and did not match strong signals for ambitious climate action from outside the negotiations. And Samantha Smith of WWF said that there was growing concern over ''what is needed and what is being promised on finance and emissions''. ''After difficult negotiations, all countries have said that more ambitious, immediate emissions cuts are needed and these commitments must be a clear outcome of the Paris talks,'' she said. ''However, that work needs to speed up too if we are going to avoid the very worst impacts of climate change.'' Delegates will return to Bonn in August and October for more rounds of climate talks, before the summit in Paris at the end of the year. The key task now is to revise the draft agreement before it reaches heads of state.  Countries are expected to agree to a plan for the co-chairs of the UN climate negotiations to produce a ''clear and concise'' version of the text.  Scientists say ambitious action is needed to avert the most severe impacts of climate change. So far, more than 30 countries have pledged to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, with around 150 smaller countries yet to set goals. Analysis suggests these do not go far enough to keep global warming below 2C. Environmental groups point to key developments outside of the negotiations that are adding momentum towards Paris. They include moves by business, such as Ikea giving $1bn to expand renewable energy and climate adaptations in developing countries. G7 leaders have also signalled the need for action with a call for greenhouse gas emissions cuts and a move towards a low carbon future.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs @hbriggs Peatlands are a natural carbon sink, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and burying it in the soil. In Europe alone, they lock up about five times more carbon than forests. But according to a new study, the continent's peatlands are in such a dry and fragile state, they could go into reverse, releasing rather than absorbing carbon. Scientists say it is more important than ever that we restore and safeguard these boggy landscapes. Researchers examined 31 peatlands across England, Ireland, Scandinavia and continental Europe to assess changes during the last 2,000 years. The  study , published in  Nature Geoscience , found that most peatlands had become drier during the period 1800-2000 than they had been for the last 600 years. Dr Maarten Blaauw from Queen's University Belfast said peatlands \"have been a great help to our planet\" - they suck carbon out of the atmosphere and store it, which helps to mitigate climate change. This study, however, shows that \"the drying of our bogs appears to have changed this process and the peatlands could now actually be turning into carbon sources - instead of absorbing carbon actually starting to emit it - clearly this is not good news for our planet\". Dr Graeme Swindles from the University of Leeds, who led the study, said it is more important than ever that we safeguard peatlands with effective management and active restoration. \"The combined pressure of climate change and human impacts may push these vitally important carbon storing ecosystems into becoming a global source of carbon emissions.\"  Peatlands are a type of wetland found in almost every country on Earth, from blanket bogs in the UK to swamp forests in Southeast Asia.  The term \"peatlands\" refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitat around it. Peat forms over the course of millions of years as waterlogged conditions slow the process of plant decomposition. Natural peatlands across the world store more carbon dioxide (CO2) than all other vegetation types in the world combined. Large amounts of carbon, extracted from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, represent a global carbon store. Countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements on climate change, as this can help reduce emissions. Climate change, peat extraction, drainage, burning and conversion to farmland have all exacted a toll on peatlands. About 15% of the world's peatlands - covering less than 0.4% of the global land surface - have been drained, releasing greenhouse gases into the air, according to the  International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN .

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC News This video can not be played Poor air quality and climate change pose a bigger threat to people's health and the economy than coronavirus, NHS staff have warned. BBC Wales has seen a letter sent on behalf of hundreds of healthcare workers to the Welsh Government. It calls for environmental issues to be prioritised as part of a \"healthy recovery\" following the pandemic. The Welsh Government said it was \"committed\" to a green recovery. The letter calls for scientific advisors to be involved in developing economic policy in the aftermath of the pandemic. Efforts to pedestrianise cities, encourage walking and cycling, and increasing how much energy is supplied by renewable sources should be sped up, it says, as well as businesses getting money to help cut energy consumption and waste. Anaesthetic registrar at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Dr Farzad Saadat, said: \"What we're asking is that the government put clean air, clean energy and a cleaner environment at the centre of their policies for the future.\" The Welsh Environmental Anaesthesia Network (WEAN), one of the organisations behind the letter, has worked with hospitals across Wales for the past 18 months to cut back on emissions of potent, planet-warming gases involved in treatment. This has resulted in a cut of 130,000kg of CO2 per month \"the same as flying to New York 130 times,\" said Dr Saadat, a WEAN member. He added: \"There's growing evidence, for instance, that air pollution makes us more susceptible to the disease and makes us more likely to have a bad outcome should we get it. \"There's convincing evidence too that diseases like Covid-19 are more likely to emerge as we destroy the natural world.\" Ysbyty Gwynedd Green Group  has also signed the letter. Member Yasmina Hamdaoui, a pharmacist, said pollution could lead to - and exacerbate - cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with possible links also to dementia and diabetes, as well as weight gain in babies and lung development in children. \"We've seen during this period that we have the ability to make drastic changes to our way of life when we need to. We want to learn from these changes and not just return to old habits.\" She said the letter was inspired by another sent to leaders of the G20 countries by more than 350 groups representing 40 million healthcare workers. \"This is our attempt to do something at a more local level, join forces as Welsh organisations and call on the Welsh Government to make a commitment too,\" she added. Air quality in parts of Cardiff ranks among the worst in the UK  when population is taken into account, and government data shows Wales has the highest levels of CO2 per capita emissions in the UK.   \"Our record to date hasn't always been the best,\" Dr Saadat said. \"While I do think the Welsh Government have been active, the reality is we have to do better - we don't have a choice.\" This video can not be played Mathew Norman, of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation in Wales, backs the plan: \"The cost of air pollution to our NHS is \u00a31bn pounds a year - that's just in Wales. \"If we improve air quality, we're not just improving the nation's health and our environment we'll also be helping the NHS.\" The circumstances surrounding coronavirus could provide an opportunity to \"fast-forward\" some of the changes required, he suggested. \"More of us are working from home,  we've seen in Cardiff and elsewhere measures to transform the city centre , bringing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianising whole streets. All of this will limit the amount of pollution we emit.\" Tracy Cross, of Llanishen, Cardiff, has  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and asthma and said every breath was like \"breathing through straws\". She has noticed a \"huge change\" in air quality during lockdown. \"It used to make my chest feel really tight and restricted and I had to risk assess every time I wanted to go out. But during lockdown it's been fantastic - I've been able to get out a lot more into the garden with my children.\" Ms Cross said it was important things did not revert to \"normal\" as there would be many people with lung conditions who have lost fitness while shielding at home and deteriorating air quality would lead to \"a lot more people suffering\". A Welsh Government spokesperson said it was \"committed to a green and socially just recovery, leading to a cleaner, healthier and more equal nation\".  \"This recovery will require working with partners across Wales,\" they said.  \"Our Team Wales approach already includes work with Natural Resources Wales who have created a panel to advise on this recovery work, and through the  Partnership Council for Wales  we have jointly set an ambitious target to achieve a net-zero carbon public sector in Wales by 2030.  \"Air pollution is the largest environmental threat to public health.  \"We will be publishing our  Clean Air Plan for Wales  this August, which reflects how we will deliver our commitment to reducing emissions and delivering vital improvements for health and well-being, natural environment, ecosystems and biodiversity.\" Coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash Switch back to cars 'detrimental' for environment Polluting gases fall rapidly as coronavirus spreads Air pollution drops amid coronavirus lockdown Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"Europe's northernmost country, the Kingdom of Norway is famed for its mountains and spectacular fjord coastline, as well as its history as a seafaring power. It also enjoys one of the world's highest standards of living, in large part due to the discovery in the late 1960s of offshore oil and gas.  It is the world's number seven oil exporter and has resisted the temptation to splurge its windfall, choosing instead to deposit the surplus wealth into its oil fund - now the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.  What to do with the money is a hot political issue: whether to use more of it to improve infrastructure or keep it for a rainy day and future generations. Norway plays an active international role. It has mediated between Israel and the Palestinians as well as in the Sri Lankan conflict, and has participated in military action in Afghanistan and Libya. Ex-premier Jens Stoltenberg is Nato's secretary general.  It defies a global ban on commercial whaling, along with Japan and Iceland. Population  5 million   Area  323,759 sq km (125,004 sq miles)  Major language  Norwegian  Major religion  Christianity  Life expectancy  79 years (men), 83 years (women)   Currency  Norwegian krone  King: Harald V Crown Prince Harald became king on the death of his father Olav V in 1991. Born in 1937, he fled with his mother and siblings to the United States after the German invasion in 1940, while his father and grandfather, the then King Haakon VII, joined the government in exile in London. King Harald is a keen sportsman, and represented Norway with distinction as a yachtsman at the Tokyo, Mexico and Munich Olympics. He caused some controversy by marrying a commoner, rather than a royal princess.  The king has clearly defined constitutional duties. Apart from being head of the armed forces and Church of Norway, he chairs the Council of State once a week. He appoints the government according to which party commands the largest number of seats in parliament, or else on the advice of the head of parliament and the prime minister of the day. King Harald has continued the royal family's tradition of unpretentious public duty, and serves as a symbol of the country's strong sense of national identity. Prime minister: Erna Solberg Erna Solberg, who has been prime minister since 2013, claimed a new mandate to govern following elections in September 2017.  She invited non-socialist parties - the Conservatives, Progress Party, Liberals, and Christian Democrats - for talks on forming a coalition government.  She headed a right-wing coalition government assembled following the September 2013 elections. Her government ruled in a minority after failing to win over several small centrist parties. But minority governments are common in Nordic countries. Ms Solberg is Norway's second female prime minister. She appointed women to half of the cabinet posts, in line with an unwritten rule about gender equality. Nicknamed \"Iron Erna\" for her tough stance as local government minister in charge of asylum and regional development in 2001-2005, Ms Solberg took over leadership of the Conservative Party in 2004 and steered it to third place in the 2009 elections. Public broadcaster NRK operates alongside major privately-owned TV and and radio networks The media are free and journalists do not face censorship or political pressure, says Reporters Without Borders. Almost all Norwegians are online. Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform.  Some key dates in Norway's history: Circa 800-1050  - Viking Age, in which Scandinavians go on plundering expeditions abroad. Some Norwegians settle at their destinations, including Scotland and Greenland. Circa 900  - Norway is unified into one kingdom. 1536  - Norway becomes a dependency of Denmark. 1814-1905  - Union with Sweden. 1905  - Independence from Sweden.

Late 1960s  - Oil and gas deposits discovered in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. By the early 1980s they constitute nearly one-third of Norway's annual export earnings. 1994  - Norwegians for the second time reject membership of the European Union in a referendum, by a margin of about 5%. 2011  - Extreme right-winger Anders Behring Breivik carries out a bomb attack and mass shooting, killing more than seventy people in the worst massacre in Norway's modern history.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The former head of this year\u2019s vital climate summit may sue the UK government for sacking her, the BBC has learned. Claire O\u2019Neill, an ex-minister, was told by Downing Street that she couldn\u2019t chair the Glasgow meeting because she was no longer a minister. But sources close to Mrs O\u2019Neill say they think she was fired for criticising government failings. They say the process for the climate meeting was in disarray. The sources said different ministers were jockeying to lead the UN meeting, known as COP26, adding that the Prime Minister was out of touch. The conference is supposed to corral governments into improving their offers to avoid dangerous climate change by cutting emissions faster. This was always a mountain to climb, especially since President Donald Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the Paris climate agreement. A government spokesperson said preparations for the conference were going well, and that the meeting would be a success.  But I understand that some of the basics still aren\u2019t in place. It seems the meeting might even be switched away to London from Glasgow because security costs there are much higher. I\u2019m told the original total cost of the conference signed off by Cabinet was \u00a3250m. It is said now to be closer to \u00a3450m, with no agreed final budget.   To compound the issue, the prime minister infuriated the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon by reportedly telling the Conservative conference he  didn\u2019t want her \"anywhere near\u201d the meeting.  Scottish government sources insist that the venue is booked and they expect the summit to happen there as planned. Mrs O\u2019Neill has previously expressed the view that the conference needs an Olympics-style delivery body. Compared with the huge French diplomatic effort that brought about a surprisingly positive deal in Paris in 2015, the UK\u2019s preparations are lagging. The French had more than 200 diplomats working for years on the meeting.  The UK has scrambled just over 100 for the task. What\u2019s more, the challenge has been made more difficult because when Boris Johnson was Foreign Secretary he fired many of the UK\u2019s overseas climate change envoys. One source close to Mrs O\u2019Neill said: \u201cBoris doesn\u2019t really know anything about climate change. He pays lip service, but hasn't got a clue. He promised to chair a Cabinet committee on climate change \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t even convened a meeting.\u201d I\u2019m told he has only discussed climate once in Cabinet. On that occasion, Mr Johnson didn\u2019t discuss policy, according to the source, but simply said he used to be a sceptic but isn't one anymore. There are others close to the government, though, who are unsurprised at Mrs O\u2019Neill\u2019s departure.  Sources said she derided some of the UK\u2019s most experienced climate diplomats because she thought they were moving too slowly and were tied to old and ineffective methods. Instead, she controversially brought in the Boston Consulting Group to advise her in meetings.  She is said to have been exasperated at the pace of progress over an issue she considers to be vitally important, and is reported to have upset officials with her tone. Mrs O'Neill has previously described herself as a \"crap diplomat but someone who gets things done\". Some observers who oppose the UK's climate change laws have celebrated her demise, arguing that she echoed environmental groups too closely. But her departure leaves a big hole, with the conference set for November. I understand that Michael Gove is keen to oversee the project. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter Do you remember the good old days when we had \"12 years to save the planet\"? Now it seems, there's a growing consensus that the next 18 months will be critical in dealing with the global heating crisis, among other environmental challenges.  Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that to keep the rise in  global temperatures below 1.5C this century , emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be cut by 45% by 2030.  But today, observers recognise that the decisive, political steps to enable the cuts in carbon to take place will have to happen before the end of next year.  The idea that 2020 is a firm deadline was eloquently addressed by one of the world's top climate scientists, speaking back in 2017. This video can not be played \"The climate math is brutally clear: While the world can't be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence until 2020,\" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and now director emeritus of the Potsdam Climate Institute. The sense that the end of next year is the last chance saloon for climate change is becoming clearer all the time. \"I am firmly of the view that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change to survivable levels and to restore nature to the equilibrium we need for our survival,\" said Prince Charles, speaking at a reception for Commonwealth foreign ministers recently. The Prince was looking ahead to a series of critical UN meetings that are due to take place between now and the end of 2020.  Ever since a global climate agreement was signed in Paris in December 2015, negotiators have been consumed with arguing about the rulebook for the pact.  But under the terms of the deal, countries have also promised to improve their carbon-cutting plans by the end of next year.  One of the understated headlines in last year's  IPCC report  was that global emissions of carbon dioxide must peak by 2020 to keep the planet below 1.5C.   Current plans are nowhere near strong enough to keep temperatures below the so-called safe limit. Right now, we are heading towards 3C of heating by 2100 not 1.5.  As countries usually scope out their plans over five and 10 year timeframes, if the 45% carbon cut target by 2030 is to be met then the plans really need to be on the table by the end of 2020.  The first major hurdle will be the  special climate summit  called by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, which will be held in New York on 23 September.  Mr Guterres has been clear that he only wants countries to come to the UN if they can make significant offers to improve their national carbon cutting plans.  This will be followed by COP25 in Santiago, Chile, where the most important achievement will likely be keeping the process moving forward.  But the really big moment  will most likely be in the UK  at COP26, which takes place at the end of 2020. The UK government believes it can use the opportunity of COP26, in a post-Brexit world, to show that Britain can build the political will for progress, in the same way the French used their diplomatic muscle to make the Paris deal happen.  \"If we succeed in our bid (to host COP26) then we will ensure we build on the Paris agreement and reflect the scientific evidence accumulating now that we need to go further and faster,\" said Environment Secretary Michael Gove, in what may have been his last major speech in the job.    \"And we need at COP26 to ensure other countries are serious about their obligations and that means leading by example. Together we must take all the steps necessary to restrict global warming to at least 1.5C.\" Whether it's the evidence of heatwaves, or the influence of Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg, or the rise of Extinction Rebellion, there has been a marked change in public interest in stories about climate change and a hunger for solutions that people can put in place in their own lives.  People are demanding significant action, and politicians in many countries have woken up to these changes.  Ideas like the  green new deal in the US , which might have seemed unfeasible a few years ago have gained real traction.  Some countries like the UK have gone even further and  legislated for net zero emissions by 2050 , the long-term goal that will keep temperatures down. Prince Charles' sense that the next 18 months are critical is shared by some climate negotiators. \"Our group of small island developing states share Prince Charles's sense of the profound urgency for ambitious climate action,\" said ambassador Janine Felson from Belize who is the chief strategist for the Alliance of Small Island States group in the UN. \"All at once we are witness to a collective convergence of public mobilisation, worsening climatic impacts and dire scientific warnings that compel decisive climate leadership.\" \"Without question, 2020 is a hard deadline for that leadership to finally manifest itself.\"  With exquisite timing, the likely UK COP in 2020 could also be the moment the US finally pulls out of the Paris agreement.  But if Donald Trump doesn't prevail in the presidential election that position could change, with a democrat victor likely to reverse the decision. Either step could have huge consequences for the climate fight.  Right now a number of countries seem keen to slow down progress. Last December the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia blocked the IPCC special report on 1.5C from UN talks.  Just a few weeks ago in Bonn, further  objections from Saudi Arabia  meant it was again dropped from the UN negotiations, much to annoyance of small island states and developing nations.  There will be significant pressure on the host country to ensure substantial progress. But if there's ongoing political turmoil around Brexit then the government may not have the bandwidth to unpick the multiple global challenges that climate change presents. \"If we cannot use that moment to accelerate ambition we will have no chance of getting to a 1.5 or 2C limit,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, from the University of Sheffield, a former climate adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  \"Right now there's nothing like enough understanding of, or commitment to, this among leading countries. That's why the UN Secretary General is holding a summit in September. \"It's great that the COP might be in UK because we have a big civil society ecosystem and much higher climate awareness than in most other countries. But the movement here has barely started to think about how to apply sufficient pressure.\"    There's also been a strong warning shot from the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC). At the launch of their review of  progress made by the UK government  on tackling climate change, the country was found not to be on track despite legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. \"The government must show it is serious about its legal obligations\u2026[its] credibility really is at stake here,\" said CCC chief executive Chris Stark. \"There is a window over the next 12-18 months to do something about this. If we don't see that, I fear the government will be embarrassed at COP26.\" And it's not all about climate change While the decisions taken on climate change in the next year or so will be critical, there are a number of other key gatherings on the environment that will shape the nature on preserving species and protecting our oceans in the coming decades. Earlier this year a major study on the losses being felt across the natural world as result of broader human impacts caused a huge stir among governments.  The  IPBES report  showed that up to one million species could be lost in coming decades.  To address this, governments will meet in China next year to try to agree a deal that will protect creatures of all types. The  Convention on Biological Diversity  is the UN body tasked with putting together a plan to protect nature up to 2030.  Next year's meeting could be a \"Paris agreement\" moment for the natural world.  If agreement is found it's likely there will be an emphasis on sustainable farming and fishing. It will urge greater protection for species and a limit on deforestation.  Next year, the  UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea  will also meet to negotiate a new global oceans treaty. This has the potential to make a real difference, according to UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove.  \"We have been convinced by the evidence of environmental degradation which occurs without adequate protection,\" he said in a speech last week.  \"And that is why the United Kingdom has taken the lead in ensuring at least 30% of the ocean we are responsible for is protected by 2030 - a trebling of the present target. We will be asking all nations to sign up to that goal.\" If all this comes to pass, the world might have a fighting chance of preserving our natural environment.  But the challenges are huge, the political involvement patchy. So don't hold your breath! Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice Delegates to the UN climate conference in Poland have reached agreement on how to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, which comes into force in 2020.   What are the key points to come out of the meeting? However dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come.  The key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor.  By that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't. Also helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy.  Keeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work. \"We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends.\" To keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry.  The new regulations are \"flexible\" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date. One of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  A group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to \"welcome\" the IPCC study.   They merely wanted to \"note\" the contents.  Efforts to find a compromise ended in failure. However that was not the end of the matter.  The vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference.  Their efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort. \"That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,\" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G. \"The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough.\" Many countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger.  For many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth.  \"I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,\" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera. \"And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down. \"It is very difficult. It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it. That's fantastic!\" While negotiators have been congratulating themselves on a job well done in landing the rulebook, there are many voices here who feel that the agreement does not go far enough.  They point to the strength of the science, and the public recognition of the impacts of climate change seen this year in heatwaves and wildfires. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Many environmental campaigners believe that Katowice was a missed opportunity for radical action. \"We have ended up here with more of a coal trade fair than a climate convention,\" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, referring to the efforts to promote coal by Poland and the US at this conference.  \"We haven't acted in good faith, particularly for the young, that we takes seriously what science is telling us and we are responding to it. That message didn't come through. \"If people think the rulebook is the way to get the world on that path, it is not robust or ambitious enough.\" One of the most striking things about this conference of the parties was the presence of energised young people in far greater numbers than I have ever seen them at a COP before.   Climate change chimes with young people in a way that is sometimes missing with older people, who make up the bulk of negotiators here. The sense that perhaps this UN process doesn't quite connect with the modern world was summed up best by Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now their lead climate negotiator.  \"Almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed.  \"We are still using the same old, dinosaur language. Still saying the same old words. \"Still making the same tedious points.\" It would be hard to argue with this view given the shenanigans that played out at the end, when one country, Brazil, held up progress at the talks on one issue for a couple of days.  Perhaps the most memorable image of this meeting was that of 15-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg.  This teenager who has organised school strikes in Sweden held daily press conferences here to drive home her message that platitudes and warm words just aren't enough anymore. Her message was sharp and succinct. \"We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis.\" Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What's your diet's carbon footprint?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Emissions from UK peatland could cancel out all carbon reduction achieved through new and existing forests, warns the countryside charity CPRE. It says many degraded peatlands are actually increasing carbon emissions.  Yet, it says, there has been much more focus from the government and media on forests than on peat bogs. The government\u2019s advisory committee on climate change told BBC News that it agreed with the conclusions of the analysis. Both that committee and the CPRE are urging more ambitious action to protect and enhance peatlands. A peat bog is a Jekyll and Hyde thing. A wet, pristine peat bog soaks up CO2 and, unlike trees, has no limit to the amount of carbon it captures. Trees only capture CO2 until they are mature. But a dry, degraded bog \u2013 like many in England\u2019s uplands \u2013 is a big source of CO2 as the carbon in the bog oxidises. So restoring bogs by filling up drainage ditches is a highly cost-effective way of reducing emissions. The CPRE points out that around 18.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions come from peatlands every year in the UK.  The same amount of emissions would be captured through existing and proposed forest. But crucially that is not before 2050 to 2055 when the trees will be fully grown. In other words, whilst forestry and peat restoration both need to be done, the best value lies with improving peat. Ministers aim to publish a peat strategy, but this has been delayed. A government response to the CPRE\u2019s warning has been requested.  Environmentalists insist the government strategy must ban peat extraction for gardens. Currently, suppliers are supposed to be phasing out peat voluntarily \u2013 but campaigners say it's far too slow. Tom Fyans from CPRE said: \u2018The government has paid too little attention to emissions from peatland. As things stand, they aren\u2019t even properly included in current emissions monitoring. \u201cThis seriously threatens the effectiveness of other nature-based solutions, like tree planting, in tackling the climate emergency. \u201cWe need much greater levels of investment in restoring or rewetting peatlands, and we need a strategy for a fair and managed transition to move businesses away from dependency on destructive use of peatlands.\u201d A Defra spokesperson said: \"This Government remains dedicated to being a world leader in tackling climate change. Healthy peatlands have an important role to play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and helping us reach our net zero target, which is why we have committed \u00a3640m through the Nature for Climate Fund to restore 35,000 hectares of England's peatland by 2025. \"We will also phase out the use of peat in horticulture in England by 2030, and have been clear that we will consider further measures to end the use of peat once and for all.\" The chief executive of the CCC, Chris Stark, said: \"Peatland restoration is a no-brainer but action needs to start now. Most of the UK's peatlands are in bad shape, accounting for around 5% the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. This problem is fixable, by restoring and managing our land more sustainably. In the longer-term, well-functioning peatlands can continuously suck up CO2 from the atmosphere, unlike trees, and represent an important and potentially growing reservoir of carbon.  \"Healthy peatland can also deliver additional benefits such as cleaner water and reduced flood risk.\" It is estimated there are over three billion tonnes of carbon stored in the peatlands in the UK \u2013 equivalent to all carbon stored in the forests of the UK, Germany and France put together.  Only 22% of the UK\u2019s peatlands are estimated to remain in a \u201cnear-natural\u201c state - that is when they are not contributing to global heating.  Peatlands also have a huge capacity to store carbon, flood waters and provide a haven for wildlife.  Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"At least 90 people have been arrested at climate change protests causing disruption across England. Extinction Rebellion organised action in London and Manchester to urge the government to prepare for a \"climate crisis\". Campaigners were arrested after they sat in the middle of the road next to Parliament Square to stop traffic. In Manchester, protesters have been urged to \"reconsider their actions\" following a  rise in Covid-19 cases. Extinction Rebellion said it planned to \"peacefully disrupt the UK Parliament in London\" with 10 days of demonstrations until MPs backed the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill. Other planned events in the capital include a \"carnival of corruption\", which is due to take place outside the Treasury, and a \"walk of shame\" near the Bank of England. Protester Karen Wildin, a 56-year-old tutor from Leicester, said: \"I'm here today because I have serious concerns about the future of the planet - we need to put this above anything else. \"Never mind Covid, never mind A-levels, this is the biggest crisis facing us and we need to raise the message as loudly as possible. \"Not a lot has been done on this issue, everyone needs to hear the message.\" Sarah Lunnon, a member of Extinction Rebellion, said: \"The failure to act on this issue will have a catastrophic impact on the future of us and the generations to come. \"We want to occupy Parliament Square to make our voices heard. Of course we're in the middle of a pandemic but we're balancing the risk, this is the biggest issue facing us.\" The Metropolitan Police said Tuesday's gathering could only take place off the main roads at Parliament Square Gardens between 08:00 BST and 19:00. Boats, vehicles, trailers or other structures were banned from the procession. The same rules apply for Wednesday's demonstrations. The Met said as of 18:00 Tuesday a total of 90 people had been arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Footage posted online by Extinction Rebellion appeared to show John Lynes, a demonstrator in his 90s, being led away by police near Parliament Square while walking with a stick.  Mr Lynes, from St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, has joined previous protests organised by the group. Met Commander Jane Connors said: \"The reason we have implemented these conditions is that we know these protests may result in serious disruption to local businesses, commuters and our communities and residents, which I will not tolerate.\" Last year, more than 1,700 arrests were made during Extinction Rebellion's 10-day Autumn Uprising. In Manchester, a march is planned through the city and Oxford Street has been closed as part of five days of action. City council deputy leader Nigel Murphy said planned demonstrations \"cannot adhere\" to social distancing rules. The city has increased restrictions due to a recent rise in Covid-19 cases. Mr Murphy said while the council respected \"the right to peaceful protest\" this should \"not be at the expense of local people\". He said: \"We are in the midst of a global public health crisis and we would ask demonstrators to seriously reconsider their actions at the current time. \"Manchester is currently under increased restrictions to limit the spread of the virus because the number of cases has been rising. Gatherings larger than six should only take place if everyone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles.\" He said the city had one of the \"most ambitious carbon targets in the UK\" and was \"working to become zero carbon by 2038\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Marc Ellison Data journalist, BBC Scotland The A83 runs for almost 100 miles from Loch Lomond to Campbeltown, at the foot of the Kintyre peninsula. But there is one section, near the Rest and Be Thankful, which has become infamous for landslips, closures and long diversions. James MacDonald and his family watched in horror as 30,000 tonnes of rock and mud churned its way down the side of the mountain towards them. He later described the landslide as \"boiling with gyrations and spurts of water\" and the noise of an \"indescribable roar - the roar of a mountain in torment\". The road near Arrochar became impassable as the debris hurtled down, and flooded the Glen Croe valley below. But this landslide is not the one that has  closed the mountain road  for the last three weeks; nor was it then known as the A83. MacDonald's testimony is from 1913. \"These landslips have always happened here,\" says Mary Haggarty. \"They've just become something that we've learned to live with\". Mary, who chairs the  local heritage group , has lived in Arrochar since her birth in 1942. This video can not be played An old school log from February 1913 states matter-of-factly that \"attendance [is] reduced this week owing to a landslip having occurred rendering the road impassable for those of the scholars who had to come by it\". \"It wasn't such a big deal then - people just got out with shovels and cleared the roads themselves,\" Mary says.  \"And people would just use steamer ships to get to where they wanted to go.\" But times, it seems, have changed. \"There's heavier traffic now, and life moves faster with people in a rush to get to places,\" she says. The A83 provides a vital link to towns such as Inveraray, Lochgilphead and Campbeltown and the Kintyre peninsula, and is used by 4,000 vehicles a day. Mary's great-grandfather John Bell was a roadman who was employed to maintain the track through Glen Croe as it snaked its way north to Inverary. He worked the road in 1913 when it was hit by a landslide, and in 1926 another landslip almost carried away his house. Of course back then it wasn't called the A83. For centuries the pass has been affectionately known as The Rest and Be Thankful, or simply The Rest. The climb out of Glen Croe is so long and steep that it was traditional for travellers and drovers to rest at the top, and be thankful for having made the highest point (803 feet). What had been just a valley track for centuries, started to become a road proper in 1743 in response to the Jacobite uprisings. General George Wade recommended the construction of more than 40 miles of road which would link a series of military forts. By the 1920s the track was in disrepair, and a London Times editorial lamented its maintenance as \"an impossible burden\" for the taxpayers of the Highland counties. As a result, construction on a new road began in 1937 at a cost of \u00a3100,000 - that's nearly \u00a37m at today's prices. Construction continued despite the onset of World War Two and the new road - sitting 150 metres to the east of the old military road - was completed in 1941. But while travellers may be thankful to reach the top, the slope above the pass has been restless. Dr Andrew Finlayson - a geomorphologist from the British Geological Survey - attributes this to the steep slopes, the sediment on the hillsides, and spells of high rainfall. When water gets into the sediment, this reduces its strength. \"The glaciers that once flowed here have contributed to these conditions by eroding steeper slopes and piling up sediment high on the hillsides,\" he says. \"When the glaciers melted the sediment was no longer supported by the ice margins, so in places it can be susceptible to landsliding.\" Most of the \"debris flow\" in the area took place in the first few centuries after the last glaciers melted - about 11,500 years ago.   \"The landscape now is much more stable than it was then, but we still see this episodic behaviour driven by rainfall events,\" he says. On sunny days a series of small valleys, caused by previous landslides, cast shadows accentuating these scars across the south-western slope of Beinn Luibhean. It is here, near the base of the 858m high mountain, where The Rest has been carved into its side. In recent years the road it has become infamous for the number of closures caused by landslips. It was closed for 17 days in October 2007, and since then nine more landslides have left the road impassable. It was blocked in September 2009, December 2011, August 2012, October 2013, October 2014, October 2015, October 2018 - and twice this year. About 1,000 tonnes of debris closed the road  in January , and earlier this month it was blocked by 6,000 tonnes of debris - including  \"car-sized boulders\"  - after heavy rain. When the The Rest is closed, the Old Military Road is used to convoy vehicles up the pass in a single file. If both roads are shut, drivers face a lengthy diversion. Transport Scotland has invested more than \u00a313.6m in landslide measures in the area. This work is estimated to have helped keep The Rest open for 48 days when it would otherwise have closed. This is just part of the \u00a382m invested in the wider maintenance of the A83 since 2007. The work includes four \"catchpits\", which have now been completed, with a total capacity of almost 15,000 tonnes. Mary Haggarty says any closures of the road now have a greater economic impact than they did when she was growing up - simply because Arrochar is now so reliant on tourism. The losses associated with the 2007 landslide were estimated to be about \u00a380,000 per day - which comes to \u00a31.2m over the 15 day closure. The road has already been closed for more than three weeks as a result of the landslide on 5 August this year. The Scottish government has asked Transport Scotland to speed up its work on providing a long-term solution to dealing with the problem. Jim Young, a former chair of the Institution of Civil Engineers Scotland, says environmental shifts are now an additional challenge. \"We know that in whatever form it may be - whether it's heavier rainstorms, changing temperature - climate change is upon us and it will impact on various bits of our infrastructure,\" he says. \"Roads are the obvious one. Whatever happens, we've got to look at the whole infrastructure systems that support our society.\" All images are copyrighted. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"id":null,"body":"By Suzanne Bearne Business reporter The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Christian Kroll, the founder and chief executive of internet search engine Ecosia. Christian Kroll wants nothing less than to change the world. \"I want to make the world a greener, better place,\" he says. \"I also want to prove that there is a more ethical alternative to the kind of greedy capitalism that is coming close to destroying the planet.\" The 35-year-old German is the boss of search engine Ecosia, which has an unusual but very environmentally friendly business model - it gives away most of its profits to enable trees to be planted around the world. Founded by Christian in 2009, Ecosia makes its money in the same way as Google - from advertising revenues. It earns cash every time someone clicks on one of the adverts that appears above and beside its search results. Ecosia then donates 80% of the profits it makes from this to tree-planting charities. To date it has funded more than 105 million new trees, from Indonesia to Brazil, and Kenya to Haiti. As obviously not everyone clicks on the adverts, the company estimates that, on average,  it takes 45 searches to raise the 0.22 euro (20p; 26 US cents) cost of planting of one tree. Today Berlin-based Ecosia says it has 15 million users. This is a tiny drop in the ocean  compared with Google's estimated 5.6 billion searches per day,  but Christian says he has grand ambitions to \"scale massively, win more users, and plant billions of trees\". And unlike the billionaire founders of Google - Larry Page and Sergey Brin - he promises to never buy a super yacht. \"While they have big yachts I have an inflatable dinghy that I take to lakes. Ego consumption is not appropriate in a world where there's climate change.\" Christian would, in fact, struggle to buy a yacht if he ever wanted one, as he put two legally binding restrictions on the business - shareholders and staff cannot personally sell shares or take profits outside of the company. Born in the former East Germany in 1985, Christian wasn't always so altruistic. As a teenager in the town of Wittenberg, he and his friends would play the stock markets, often trebling their investments. He wanted to become a stockbroker, and so enrolled to study business administration at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Bavaria. However, his world view changed when aged 18 he went travelling for three months through India. \"I met smarter people than me who didn't have the same opportunities because they weren't born in Germany,\" he says. \"It started dawning on me that maybe I should do something to make the world a better place.\" Then at university he first started to pay close attention to online advertising when he set up a website that compared different online brokers. \"I was shocked at how much of my revenue I was spending on Google ads to bring traffic to the site,\" he says. And so his idea for what would eventually become Ecosia was born. \"It became clear to me that Google had a very smart business model, and it was also fairly obvious that there was space for a purpose-driven search engine to do something similar... to use the money to fund tree planting.\" After university he spent six months in Nepal in 2007, where he first tried and failed to launch a search engine to raise funds for local charity and non-government projects. \"I didn't know how to launch a business, funds were limited, and most days there were internet and electricity issues.\" He then spent 10 months in South America where the level of deforestation that he saw gave him the determination to launch Ecosia in 2009 after he had returned to Germany. The name is a mixture of the words \"eco\" and \"utopia\". Christian says he got the business up and running with the help of others. \"The truth is that I didn't have the technical knowledge to do it, but I was able to rely upon the skillset of friends and family,\" he says.  Today Ecosia employs 70 people, and  it publishes financial statements online every month.  Last year it had annual revenues of \u20ac19.3m (\u00a317.3m; $22.8m), and a pre-tax profit of \u20ac14.5m. All of its electricity comes from solar power, and 80% of its users are said to be 29 or younger. Its search engine uses Microsoft's Bing's technology, with whom it has a long-term arrangement. \"They really like what we are doing,\" says Christian. Eric Haggstrom, analyst at business research group Insider Intelligence, says that Ecosia and other smaller search engines face \"significant obstacles\". \"Most importantly, Google provides the default search for Android devices, and the Chrome browser,\" he says. \"And it spends billions of dollars a year to be the default search provider for Apple devices. More  The Boss  features: \"Most users won't use search engines other than their device or browser defaults. And on the ad side, advertisers use Google's search product because it performs [so] well.\" Christian admits it \"can be tricky\", and wants regulators to do something to loosen Google's grip. But more generally, he wants to see capitalism changed for the better. \"This is really needed in the 21st Century,\" he says. \"What we're trying to do is reform capitalism. I think in its current state it's not healthy. I want us to rethink how business should be, what the role of business is.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"Thousands of British holidaymakers have made a last-minute dash to get home before a 14-day quarantine requirement came into force for people arriving from France.  The isolation measure also applies to the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba, amid concerns about a rising numbers of Covid cases. Eurotunnel trains sold out and air fares were up to six times more than normal, but ferries increased capacity. France warned of \"reciprocal measures\". The Netherlands  advised against all but essential travel to the UK  once the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but said it would not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. There were reported to be about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France when the changes were announced, and the deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Kim Wells and his family were on one of the last ferries to arrive in the UK before the quarantine measures began - getting in to Newhaven from Dieppe in northern France with eight minutes to spare. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had a \"pretty fraught 40 minutes\" online after hearing of the restrictions through a BBC News alert. \"I ended up booking a ferry on a pretty unfashionable route... it was impossible to get back on Eurotunnel, which was the way we went to France originally,\" he said. Mr Wells is a teacher and his wife is a local government worker. They felt they should cut their holiday short to avoid having to quarantine as they are key workers.  This video can not be played Mr Wells said he was frustrated by the short notice the government had given for the rule change, adding: \"I completely understand the decision, but I think 30 hours' notice and announcing it at 11 o'clock in the evening French time... was pretty unrealistic.  \"I don't really understand why they can't be a little bit more clear with the public about what the tipping point is, when we might perhaps be approaching the need to quarantine. Why not 48 or even 72 [hours] just to allow those who need to or want to get home, get home without rushing dangerously.\" This video can not be played Kate Mooney and her family arrived back at their home in Cornwall at about 01:00 BST after ending their holiday to France a week early. \"Our immediate response was 'let's just stay and finish our holiday', and then we started to really consider what quarantine meant,\" she told BBC Breakfast.  \"There would be no way we could leave the house... that's when we decided we would come back.\"  Tom Duffell, who runs a small business and ended his family holiday in Nice four days early, told the BBC that social distancing had \"gone out of the window\" in the scramble for transport, with \"huge queues\" at the airport. Eurotunnel, which increased its capacity, said 12,000 people had tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced - at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It carried more than 30,000 passengers in the run-up to the deadline. Additional staff were sent to the terminals to allow 11,600 vehicles to quickly load its shuttles throughout Friday. P&O Ferries and DFDS Ferries also added an extra four departures. Meanwhile, a group of musicians from Scotland found a creative way to beat the deadline with just 10 minutes to spare - by  chartering a fishing boat  to get them back to the UK. After a five-hour Channel crossing, eight members of the Scotland-based Dunedin Consort arrived at Hayling Island in Hampshire at 03:50. They made the last-minute dash after a performance in Lessay Abbey, Normandy, on Friday night. Some were unable to get back home in time. One passenger arriving at Gatwick soon after the deadline had passed told BBC Radio 4: \"It's ridiculous. They're leaving us high and dry. We tried to change our flights... impossible. \"Me and the kids have been to Cornwall and the Lake District this summer and I don't think that felt any more at risk than where we've been - in a fairly rural part of France.\" Another said: \"It's a shame to have missed it by such a narrow margin but that's life really, so we've just got to get on with it.\"  One woman is wondering whether her unusual journey from France to Britain later today will fall foul of the travel rules. Australian Chloe McCardel, 35, is aiming to complete her 35th endurance swim across the Channel. If she's successful, she will beat the current men's record for the most Channel crossings, held by British athlete Kevin Murphy. She is due to leave Dover at 20:00 BST and aims to make the 21-mile crossing to Calais in about 10 hours, before heading back to her support boat for the return journey. Since she will only stand on French soil for a matter of minutes, McCardel hopes it won't be necessary to spend 14 days in self-isolation on her return. \"We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,\" she said. \"I've got a little celebration planned in England with the support crew, the team, the volunteers who have been so supportive throughout this. So I am hoping the government allow us to do that without having to quarantine.\" Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said the UK was lagging behind other countries that had \"shunned quarantines\" in favour of \"comprehensive\" testing programmes for everyone departing and arriving back into their respective countries. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said that while Labour supported \"evidence-based measures\" at the border, it was \"vital\" that No 10 had a \"joined-up strategy\" and \"urgently\" put in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. He added: \"That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine.\" This video can not be played The Foreign Office is now warning against all but essential travel to France.  According to data company Statista, Britons paid  10.35 million visits to France  last year, putting it second behind Spain - with 18.12 million - in terms of popularity. A list of more than 50 so-called travel corridors - allowing movement between the UK and other countries without the need to self-isolate on return - was  published at the start of last month  and later expanded.  But quarantine measures were later re-imposed on several countries, including Spain on 25 July. On Friday, France reported 2,846 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours - the highest number since lockdown restrictions were eased. The seven-day average increased to 2,041, marking the first time it has surpassed 2,000 since 20 April, a 66% week-on-week rise. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%. And the increase for Malta was 105%, while it was 273% for Turks and Caicos and 1,106% for Aruba. Have you been affected by the recent quarantine changes?

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter Unless a rich benefactor steps in, the role of human-induced climate change in Cyclone Idai is unlikely to be clearly determined.  The scientists with the expertise simply don't have the resources to do the large amount of computer modelling required.  However, there are a number of conclusions about rising temperatures that researchers have gleaned from previous studies on tropical cyclones in the region.   While Cyclone Idai is the seventh such major storm of the Indian Ocean season - more than double the average for this time of year - the long-term trend does not support the idea that these type of events are now more frequent.  \"The interesting thing for the area is that the frequency of tropical cyclones has decreased ever so slightly over the last 70 years,\" said Dr Jennifer Fitchett from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa who has studied the question. \"Instead, we are getting a much higher frequency of high-intensity storms.\" Climate change is also changing a number of factors in the background that are contributing to making the impact of these storms worse.   \"There is absolutely no doubt that when there is a tropical cyclone like this, then because of climate change the rainfall intensities are higher,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, who has carried a number of studies looking at the influence of warming on specific events.  \"And also because of sea-level rise, the resulting flooding is more intense than it would be without human-induced climate change.\" A poor country with a long coastline, Mozambique is especially vulnerable to storms sweeping in from the Indian Ocean.  More than 700 lives were lost during a devastating flood there nearly 20 years ago. I was one of many journalists reporting on the plight of communities submerged. One woman, stranded in a tree, was forced to give birth among the branches.  A huge international response saw the Royal Air Force send six helicopters to rescue survivors. Back then, the priority was to save lives. Little thought was given to rebuilding homes and infrastructure with new designs to help them withstand future storms.  Development experts have long argued that reconstruction should enshrine the principle of resilience, with roads raised high enough to stay dry in floods and houses made robust enough to resist cyclone-strength winds.  There are plenty of examples of how this forward-thinking can help. In low-lying Bangladesh, there are schools built on high ground which can serve as refuges during storms.  And as the potential effects of climate change become better understood, there's growing recognition of the need for communities to adapt to what could be tougher conditions ahead.  One critical factor in the Southern Indian Ocean that is having an impact on these storms is sea-surface temperatures. Warmer seas mean there is more energy available for cyclones, which only form when the water reaches 26 degrees C.   These storms also need help from the Earth's rotation to get them spinning. This rotating effect gets stronger the further you move away from the Equator and towards the poles.  However, in previous decades, the further away you were from the Equator meant the cooler the seas became and so any tropical cyclones that formed didn't have the energy to keep going. Now climate change is impacting that relationship. \"Under increasing sea-surface temperatures, we are seeing the line of constant temperature required for these storms to form moving further and further towards the South Pole,\" said Dr Fitchett.   \"So it is increasing the range in which these storms can form and that's then allowing them to intensify so quickly.\"  But it's not just a simple equation. Higher sea-surface temperatures can also work against the formation of cyclones.  \"On the one hand, you have the higher ocean temperatures and that lends more energy for tropical cyclones to form,\" said Dr Otto. \"But you also have higher temperatures in the atmosphere which leads to more wind shear, which weakens hurricanes.\" According to researchers, about seven different ocean or atmospheric conditions are required for cyclone formation and normally only a couple of these occur. However, because of climate change, more and more of these conditions are coinciding with each other and that's why these big storms happen very quickly.  Whatever arguments about the impacts of climate change on tropical cyclones, the damage caused in Mozambique has much more to do with the vulnerability of people on the ground than rising temperatures.  \"If you look at North America, they are experiencing Category 5 cyclones quite regularly now, and they don't experience the level of damage that Mozambique is seeing,\" said Dr Fitchett. \"When a storm like this comes along, the potential for devastation is infinitely higher. A city like Beria is at much higher risk, because not only have you many more people there, it's also so much more difficult for them to get out.\"  Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, BBC News The UN has released its assessment of national plans to limit climate change, submitted by 146 countries. Officials say the submissions, in their current form, won't keep global temperatures from rising by more than the 2C danger threshold. The global total of carbon emissions will continue to grow, although more slowly than over the past two decades. However  the UN report  says the plans are a major step forward and the 2C goal is still \"within reach\". The UN believes that these national climate plans, called  Intended Nationally Determined Contributions  (INDCs) will form the cornerstone of a binding, global treaty on climate change that will be agreed at a  conference in Paris  in December. According to the UN, the submissions now cover around 86% of global emissions: about four times the amount covered by the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first carbon cutting treaty. Their assessment is decidedly upbeat about the plans, despite acknowledging that taken together they point to rises in global temperatures of 2.7C above the pre-industrial level.  Scientists have determined that if temperature rises exceed 2C, this will lead to significant and dangerous climate impacts, which will especially hit the world's poor.   UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said the plans were an excellent first step: \"The INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7C by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.\"  Observers say the 2.7C figure is a substantial improvement on 3.1C, which was the estimate when the plans were assessed last December.  COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities. Explained:  What is climate change? In video:  Why does the Paris conference matter? Analysis:  Latest from BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath More:  BBC News climate change special report A key finding of the UN reports is that the INDCs will bring down per capita emissions by 9% by 2030.  But while the rate of growth in CO2 may be declining, the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere will continue to grow significantly over the next 15 years.  Compared to 2010 levels, the UN says that overall emissions could be up to 22% higher in 2030. The assessment says that, as they stand, the plans won't achieve the goal of peaking global emissions and then reducing them rapidly. Another concern is that 25% of the total range of emissions reductions are conditional upon financial support from richer countries.  Despite these issues, the fact that so many countries, rich and poor, have submitted plans to cut carbon is giving environmental campaigners great hope that a new deal is imminent.  \"The vast majority of the INDCs this time around, 105 of them, contain concrete greenhouse gas mitigation targets. That's in contrast to 27 for Copenhagen,\" said Taryn Fransen from the World Resources Institute, referring to the failed conference in the Danish capital in 2009. \"You have quite a few more countries that are now specifying absolute decreases in emissions levels. You have countries like China, South Africa and Singapore talking about peaking emissions through a hard cap.  \"Even much smaller countries like Ethiopia, Bhutan and Costa Rica are identifying absolute limits on the quantity of emissions. I think that signals a real evolution.\" The challenge for the UN is now to take these intentions and turn them into a coherent and legally binding deal when heads of government and negotiators meet in Paris in a month.  Analysis: David Shukman - BBC Science Editor  An \"unprecedented engagement\", says Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN's climate change negotiations. And if one thinks back to the irritable, dysfunctional days of the Copenhagen summit in 2009, the last big push for an international response to global warming, there has been a remarkable turnaround.  In the aftermath of that failed gathering, it seemed almost inconceivable that within a matter of years new momentum would be returned to what has generally been a faltering process.  It's worth bearing in mind that the national pledges to take action are of course entirely voluntary.  When the idea of individual submissions was first agreed, it was perfectly possible that many, if not most, of the world's 196 countries would choose to turn a blind eye, or plead some other pressing distraction, or argue that cutting greenhouse gases is a task to be faced by others.  Instead, an impressive 86% of global emissions are covered if you add up the total of all the different pledges. Will it ultimately make any difference?  The numbers don't add up to what the scientists say is needed to avoid the worst of global warming. Emissions will still keep rising, albeit at a slower pace.  And the promises are just that - promises. Who knows how many governments will turn them into law and take them seriously? How many will refuse to act until the right finance is offered?  The outcome of all this is uncertain and much depends on the exact deal thrashed out at the approaching summit in Paris.  Copenhagen may well haunt the talks. But compared to where this process stood six years ago, there's a world of difference. Even though the plans don't add up to enough of a cut to avoid a 2C rise, campaigners believe that a strong review mechanism can - and must - be put in place by the Paris agreement. \"Paris will not be the end of the world's efforts to tackle climate change, but it might be the end of the beginning,\" said Mohammed Adow from Christian Aid.  \"Going forward we will need a five-year review mechanism that will track how countries are doing and push them to do more as technology advances and more finance becomes available.\"  Getting all that into a Paris deal won't be easy. In fact the emissions pledges are the most straightforward aspect. In fact, the negotiators now have a  draft document that runs to 50 dense pages .  In the words of one delegate at a recent negotiating session, even the world's best paid lawyer would be hard pressed to understand it.

{"id":null,"body":"Once home to several pre-colonial empires, the landlocked, arid West African country of Mali is one of the largest on the continent. For centuries, its northern city of Timbuktu was a key regional trading post and centre of Islamic culture.  But this prominence has long since faded. After independence from France in 1960, Mali suffered droughts, rebellions, a coup and 23 years of military dictatorship until democratic elections in 1992. In 2013, France intervened militarily upon the government's request following the capture of the town of Konna and its troops overran Islamist strongholds. Authorities agreed a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire with Tuareg separatists in 2015, but parts of the country remain tense, with Tuareg rebels sporadically active. Meanwhile, a jihadist insurgency in Mali's north and central regions continues. Mali is renowned worldwide for having produced some of the stars of African music, most notably Salif Keita. Interim head of state: Assimi Go\u00efta The military council that seized power in August 2020 is led by Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta.  At first he put an interim president and prime minister in place, but ousted them in May 2021 in a dispute over their attempt to replace two Go\u00efta allies in the cabinet. West African leaders have expressed concern over the lack of opposition and civilian representation in the planned 18-month transition to elections. Mali has struggled with mass protests over corruption, electoral probity, and a jihadist insurgency that has made much of the north and east ungovernable.  President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta, who took office in September 2013, proved unable to unify the country or face down the insurgency, and was ousted in the August 2020 coup.  The media environment in Bamako and the south is relatively open, but the presence of armed militant groups in the north poses dangers for media workers, says Freedom House. Radio is the leading medium. There are hundreds of stations, run by the state as well as by private operators. Some key dates in Mali's history: 11th century  - Empire of Mali becomes dominant force in the upper Niger basin. 14th-15th centuries  - Decline of the Empire of Mali, which loses dominance of the gold trade to the Songhai Empire. Late 16th century  - Moroccans defeat the Songhai, make Timbuktu their capital and rule until their decline in the 18th century. 1898  - France completes conquest of Mali, then called French Sudan. 1960  - Mali becomes independent with Modibo Ke\u00efta as president. It becomes a one-party, socialist state.  2012  - Coup after which Islamist fighters capture several towns. France intervenes militarily and recaptures key towns from the rebels. 2020  - President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta ousted in coup.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Scientists have found a clever new way of measuring ocean warming, using sound waves from undersea earthquakes.  The researchers say the \"hack\" works because sound travels faster in warmer water. The team looked at sonic data from the Indian Ocean emitted by tremors over a 10-year period. As the seas have warmed due to global heating, the scientists have seen the sound waves increase in speed. Their new method shows the decadal warming trend in the Indian Ocean was far higher than previous estimates. Having accurate information on the warming of our oceans is critical for climate scientists. They understand that around 90% of the energy trapped in our atmosphere by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the seas. But having precise temperature measurements, in multiple locations and depths, is a huge challenge.  The deployment of around 4,000 autonomous devices called  Argo floats  that capture temperature information has helped enormously, but there are big gaps in our knowledge. This is especially true in relation to what's happening in the waters deeper than 2,000m.  But now a team of researchers has developed a very different approach that exploits the fact that the speed of sound in seawater depends on temperature. The idea was first proposed and trialled in the late 1970s using sound waves generated by scientists. However, concerns over the impact of these sounds on marine mammals and rising costs saw the idea abandoned. The new approach involves using the naturally produced sound waves that occur when an underwater earthquake strikes.  The scientists examined data from over 4,000 tremors that occurred in the Indian Ocean between 2004 and 2016.  The team then looked for pairs of \"repeaters\", earthquakes with almost identical origins and power.  By measuring how long these slow-moving signals took to travel across the waters from Indonesia to a monitoring station on the island of Diego Garcia, they were able to work out the changes in temperature for the whole of the ocean over the 10-year period.  \"It takes sound waves about half an hour to travel from Sumatra to Diego Garcia,\" lead author Dr Wenbo Wu from the California Institute of Technology told BBC News. \"The temperature change of the deep ocean between Sumatra and Diego Garcia causes this half-hour travel time to vary by a few tenths of a second. \"Because we can measure these variations very accurately, we can infer the small changes in the average temperature of the deep ocean, in this case about a tenth of a degree.\" The author says the system has some major advantages, as it is able to provide a large-scale average temperature along the 3,000km path from Sumatra to Diego Garcia, which reduces the influence of local fluctuations, essentially making it more accurate over the ocean as a whole. The method is also quite cheap, as it uses data that's already being gathered, and is sensitive to temperatures deeper than the current restriction of 2,000m. In their research, the scientists showed that warming in the Indian Ocean over the decade that they studied was greater than previously estimated.  However, the paper has some important caveats. \"It is important to emphasise that this is a result that applies to this particular region and this particular decade,\" said Dr Wu. \"We need to apply our method in many more regions and over different time frames to evaluate whether there is any systematic under- or over-estimation of the deep-ocean trend globally. \"It is much too early to draw any conclusions in this direction.\" To make the idea work on a global scale, the scientists will need access to more underwater receivers. Right now, the research team is working with data collected by a hydrophone network operated by the  United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization , which is listening for underwater nuclear explosions.  These hydrophones pick up signals from many of the 10,000 shallow submarine earthquakes that occur globally every year, explained Dr Wu. \"All this data contains information on the temperature change of the deep ocean \u2014 it is just waiting for us to extract it.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Science.

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change could have a \"huge impact\" on China, reducing crop yields and harming the environment, the country's top weather scientist has warned, in a rare official admission. Zheng Guogang told Xinhua news agency that climate change could be a \"serious threat\" to big infrastructure projects. He said temperature rises in China were already higher than global averages. China, the world's biggest polluter, has said its emissions of gases that cause climate change will peak by 2030. However,  the country has not set a specific target  for cutting emissions of the gases, mainly carbon dioxide. Mr Zheng, the head of China's meteorological administration, said warming temperatures exposed his country to a growing \"risk of climate change and climate disasters\". He said temperature rises in China had already been higher than the global average for the past century. These are rare admissions from a Chinese official, BBC Asia analyst Michael Bristow says. China's leaders have acknowledged the damage from global warming but they usually do not lay out the full scale of the problems. Mr Zheng warned of more droughts, rainstorms, and higher temperatures, which would threaten river flows and harvests, as well as major infrastructure projects such as the Three Gorges Dam. He urged China to pursue a lower-carbon future. \"To face the challenges from past and future climate change, we must respect nature and live in harmony with it,\" the Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.  \"We must promote the idea of nature and emphasise climate security.\" China and the US together produce around 45% of global carbon emissions. Leaders from the two countries are  taking part in a summit in Paris this year  that will aim for a global deal to cut carbon emissions by 2020. China's decades-long pursuit of rapid economic growth  has boosted demand for energy , particularly coal. Scientists fear that pledges made so far to cut emissions will not be enough to avoid the harmful impact of climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A preliminary analysis of global temperature data for July suggests it may have \"marginally\" become the warmest month on record.  Figures from the first 29 days of a month in which many countries had heatwaves are \"on a par\" or slightly higher than a record set in July 2016. The assessment was carried out by researchers at the EU's  Copernicus Climate Change Service  (C3S). Confirmation of a new record must await a full analysis is released on Monday. Scientists say it's the latest sign that Earth is experiencing unprecedented warming. The new data compiled by C3S incorporates observations from satellites and ground based stations.  Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the world The July figures are likely to be the highest recorded in the organisation's 40-year dataset.  They follow on from a global record for June, which was confirmed by data from several different agencies.  According to Copernicus, every month this year ranks among the four warmest on record for the month in question.  While researchers can't directly link these new high marks to climate change, there is a wide sense among scientists that emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities are altering background temperatures and making new records more likely.  \"This particular month has been very warm but to me this is not really the main point. The main point is that not only has this month been very warm, but last month was very warm. All months during 2019 have been very warm in terms of comparison with other years,\" Dr Freja Vamborg from Copernicus told BBC News. \"And that trend is not likely to stop unless we do something about curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\"  While July is traditionally the warmest month, this year has seen exceptional heatwaves strike Europe, the US and the Arctic.  New temperature records were set in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany as the mercury went above 40C in many places.  A new  UK heat record was set  with 38.7C at Cambridge University's Botanic Garden.   In the US, millions of people were affected as  temperatures soared along the East Coast and in the Midwest . Alaska saw a dramatic surge, with the heat smashing previous records in several cities. In Anchorage, the mercury stayed above 26C for six days in a row, doubling the previous record.  Wildfires  have raged  across the Arctic with millions of hectares burning in northern parts of Russia. India has suffered heatwaves and severe water shortages. Japan saw more than 5,000 people seek hospital treatment due to a heatwave last week. \"This is yet more evidence that we're heading for a much hotter world if we allow carbon emissions to continue to rise,\" said Dr Katherine Kramer from Christian Aid.  \"For many people in the developing world this has been a reality for some time but now heat records are tumbling across high-emitting, developed countries like the UK. \"If the new prime minister needed a reminder that he can't ignore climate change, this July has shown that the UK won't escape a heating planet. We need to move fast and put policies in place that act on Parliament's recognition that we are in a climate emergency.\" According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), July 2016 was the highest in a record that dates back to 1880. Noaa says that nine of the 10 warmest Julys on record have occurred during the 21st Century, with only one year from the 20th century, that being 1998.  The US space agency (Nasa) takes a slightly different perspective. Their data shows July 2016 and July 2017 in a statistical tie for warmest month.  Figures for July 2019 from these agencies will be released in the next couple of weeks. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman BBC Science editor, Can Tho Province, Vietnam One little girl draws a nightmarish picture of people calling for rescue as they drown in rising water. Another sketches a huge snake with sharp teeth to show the power and danger of flooding. These disturbing images are the work of children at a primary school in Can Tho province, a region of Vietnam that is regularly swamped. They live in the Mekong Delta, a huge plain of rivers and rice-fields that's popular with tourists but lies only just above the surface of the ocean. The land itself is sinking and, at the same time, the level of the sea is rising, as global warming causes the water to expand and the ice caps to melt. That's why the delta, one of the world's greatest centres for rice production and home to 18 million people, is recognised as especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This video can not be played The children were asked to draw their pictures as part of a project run by Florence Halstead from the University of Hull, a researcher into young people's attitudes on global warming. At a primary school, which was itself flooded three years ago, she asked the pupils to close their eyes and think about flooding and then to describe what was on their minds. Loi, a 10-year-old, leapt to his feet and came out with a shocking image - \"people on their houses screaming for help\". His classmate, To Nhu, used crayons to depict a small girl drifting on her own in a boat towards what looked like a whirlpool or tornado. \"I think the flood is so scary,\" she told me, \"and I hope that we will not be swept away in the flood season.\" At a neighbouring desk, another pupil, Chau, created a scene that seemed far too horrific for someone so young: bodies were in the water and, below the surface, lurked a monstrous snake. I asked her why. \"Because the snake can live under the water and is very scary so it makes me think about the flood,\" she said.  Flooding is routine in the delta. Over the centuries, it has played a beneficial role delivering nutrient-rich silt to the fields to make them exceptionally fertile.  But, in recent years, the floods have become more damaging; the projections are for more severe and frequent inundations to come.  Barriers are being built, but on one stretch of coastline more than 100 homes have been lost, along with big areas of precious farmland.  A farmer who saw fields vanish beneath the waves, Lam Van Nghia, said the water level was rising so fast that \"there wasn't enough time to build sea defences\". To add to the stress, seawater pushing inland poisons the soil with salt, either reducing yields of rice or making it impossible to grow this vital part of the food supply. Many farmers are turning to other crops like hay, which is more tolerant of salt, or shrimp which can cope with more of it, all of which reduces the volume of rice produced.  A leading farming expert even warned that the days of rice may be over for the Mekong Delta, with huge implications for food security and national income.  Thomas Rath, Vietnam director of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development, told the BBC that \"this is all under threat\". \"Rice production is under threat and 80% of the rice is for exports, so it's a big economic risk for Vietnam,\" he told the BBC. This is why Vietnam, along with several dozen other developing countries, argues that the main target of the Paris Agreement on climate change - to limit the rise in global average temperature to 2C above the pre-industrial level - does not go far enough.  It is pressing for a lower target of 1.5C . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN's climate body, is releasing  a report on the benefits of keeping global warming in check and on what is needed to achieve it. To try to understand how rapidly the region is changing, UK and Vietnamese scientists are studying the flows of the rivers and of the sediment they carry. When silt is deposited on the fields, it raises the level of the land, the one thing that helps to build it up and counteract the effect of a rising sea. This video can not be played I met Prof Dan Parsons, of the University of Hull, on a boat carrying sonar equipment to measure the river bed and the quantity of sediment in the water. Measurements over the past 20 years have shown a marked drop in the amount of sediment being delivered - the water looks clearer than in the past - and this is the result of dams upstream trapping everything in the flow. \"One clear risk is a heightened threat of flooding,\" Prof Parsons said. \"The saline intrusion that's driven by that relative rise in sea level combines to create a perfect storm of issues for people living here.\" While he and his colleagues are investigating the physical changes under way, his student, Florence Halstead, is exploring the social implications, particularly for a generation that will grow up having to face more threatening conditions. She described some of the children's pictures as \"harrowing\" but said it was important to prepare them for what lies ahead.  \"They live in a water world, and that's only going to increase - the water's not going to go away and they need to learn how to adapt.\" A really simple guide to climate change What does 1.5C mean in a warming world?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Europe is heating faster than the global average as new data indicates that last year was the warmest on record. While globally the year was the second warmest, a series of heatwaves helped push the region to a new high mark. Over the past five years, global temperatures were, on average, just over 1C warmer than at the end of the 19th century. In Europe, in the same period, temperatures were almost 2C warmer. The data has been published as Earth Day marks its 50th anniversary. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the physical signs of climate change and impacts on our planet have gathered pace in the past five years, which were the hottest on record.  The European data, which comes from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service, 11 of the 12 warmest years on record on the continent have occurred since 2000. The  European State of the Climate 2019  shows that warm conditions and summer heatwaves saw drought in many parts of central Europe. While the  UK saw a new all-time high temperature  recorded in Cambridge in July, in many places across the continent, the weather was 3-4C warmer than normal.  This is reflected in the amount of sunshine that hit Europe across the year.  The number of sunshine hours was the largest on record. The hot summer weather across Europe was followed by one of the wettest Novembers on record, with rainfall almost four times the normal amount in western and southern Europe. The European Arctic region though was below the high temperatures seen in recent years, just 0.9C higher than average. Taken together, the data show \"a clear warming trend across the last four decades.\"  \"Europe has indeed been warming significantly faster than the global average,\" said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of science (climate) at the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science.  \"This is for two reasons.  First, land regions in general are warming faster than the oceans, largely because the greater availability of moisture over the oceans damps the rate of warming.\"  \"Secondly, reductions in specific forms of air pollution have contributed to the recent warming in Europe, particularly in summer.\" What will worry researchers is that the mean temperature in Europe over the past five years is averaging almost 2C warmer than pre-industrial figures.  This suggests that the continent is breaching the promise made in the Paris climate agreement to keep temperatures \"well below\" 2C. \"In lockdown, sitting on our sofas or our makeshift desks or in many more difficult situations, it would be easy for us to take our eyes off this alarming reality; that 2019 was the warmest year on record for Europe, that November brought us massively more precipitation than normal,\" said Prof Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading. \"And for every decade I have been on this planet, it has been getting hotter and hotter and hotter. \" Researchers in the field are keen to underline that while the coronavirus pandemic might mean a temporary drop in emissions of greenhouse gases, much more will need to be done to arrest the worrying warming trend.  \"While pollution has dropped with economic activity in response to the global pandemic, CO2 is not just disappearing overnight,\" said Prof Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol. \"The impact of the warming like sea level rise will be with us for centuries. The pandemic has made us less able to tackle the impact of climate change impacts. Our communities which have just been flooded will find sheltering in their damaged homes much more challenging. \"We have also learned, though, during the last months that actions taken together to make a difference.\" The new data has been published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.  Commenting on the Earth Day anniversary, the WMO's secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said it was important to continue tackling climate change amid the global pandemic.  \"Whilst COVID-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries,\" he said.  \"We need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves.\" Echoing  earlier comments by the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres , Mr Taalas commented: \"We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against COVID-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity not just for the coming weeks and months, but for many generations ahead.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The top 10 warmest years on record in the UK have all occurred since 2002, a new analysis from the Met Office says.  Its State of the UK Climate report shows that 2014 remains the warmest year in a temperature sequence now dating back to 1884. Despite last summer's blistering heat, 2018 only places as the seventh warmest year on record - as the statistic is based on temperatures all year round. When it comes to the coldest years, the most recent in the top 10 was in 1963.  The patterns of warm and cold years in Britain are a clear signal of climate change, say scientists. It comes after the Met Office confirmed this week that  the UK's hottest temperature ever - 38.7C (101.7F) - was recorded on Thursday in Cambridge .  The Met Office scientist who compiled the new analysis says that the clustering of all the warmest years in the first two decades of the 21st Century is what would be expected in a changing climate.  \"It's certainly what we'd expect to see. Our climate in the UK has warmed at a very similar amount to the global temperature rise, so just under 1C for the UK,\" said Dr Mark McCarthy.  \"Under that warming climate, we would expect that the hot extremes would tend to cluster in more recent times and the colder extremes are further back in time. \"Although we do still experience colder extremes like 'the beast from the east' last spring, generally speaking the story we have is that overall it's the warmer events and these higher temperatures that are dominating.\"  This is the fifth such report published by the Met Office and, thanks to a project to digitise historic weather records, it has now been extended to cover the years back to 1884. Previous versions only stretched back to 1910.  This has not made any difference to the record of the UK's warmest years, but it has significantly changed the record of the coldest years, with five of the 10 chilliest occurring in the 1880s or 1890s. There is a significant difference between the coldest year in the sequence and the hottest - with the average temperature for 1892 just over 7C, while the average for the warmest saw an average approaching 10C.  Colder years have been in short supply since the turn of the millennium, with 2010 being the chilliest, and that only ranks at 22nd on the cold list.  Again it is not a measure of the most severe winters but of the lowest average temperature, based on levels measured all year round. \"We expect that extremely cold years nowadays like 2010 aren't as extreme as the cold years in the past, but the warm years are more extreme than the equivalent from 50-100 years ago,\" Dr McCarthy told BBC News.  There's no huge surprise here.  For years the Met Office has been saying that its data shows unmistakeable evidence of rising temperatures, both in the UK and worldwide, driven by the gases given off by human activity.  This latest analysis is another way of highlighting what our warming climate means. It won't be the end of deep freeze winters or of chilly summers - our island weather is too variable for that.  But the report suggests that the records over the past century or more reveal a very clear pattern of change. An obvious question is: Don't we know this all already? And you'd be right. But each passing year offers another chance for climate scientists to search for trends and to share their findings.  I'm old enough to remember the last of Britain's top 10 cold winters - back in 1963 - and everyone's becoming more familiar with the warmer conditions of recent years.  This video can not be played 2018 was the third sunniest year on record in a series dating back to 1929.  Despite this, and the very hot summer weather that tied the record for the warmest three-month period, the overall temperature for the year only placed it in seventh place in the list of the top 10 hottest. One big factor dragging the year down was the so-called beast from the east, when a record low temperature was recorded on 1 March.  Another may have been the snow, with the UK recording the most significant snowfall since 2010. When it comes to rain, six of the 10 wettest years in the UK have occurred since 1998.  Over the last decade, our hot and cold seasons have been getting wetter than the long-term average with the summers seeing 13% more rain while the winters going up by 12%. \"It is also interesting that a high number of the wettest years in the UK occurred recently, showing that climate change starts to show up even in highly variable aspects of weather such as rainfall,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl from the University of Edinburgh who wasn't involved with the study. \"Climate change already matters to the UK and makes a difference.\" Despite the UK breaking the record for  its warmest day last week , the Met Office researchers are reluctant to speculate on where 2019 might end up in the hottest years list.  \"It's been something of a mixed bag so far this year. On balance, it's too early to say where we will end up in 2019 because just a few extreme months can make a significant difference,\" said Dr McCarthy. Follow Matt on Twitter  @MattMcGrathBBC .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Madrid UN climate talks in Madrid enter their final scheduled day with divisions emerging between major emitting countries and small island states.   Negotiators are attempting to agree a deal in the Spanish capital that would see countries commit to make new climate pledges by the end of 2020. But serious disagreements have emerged over how much carbon-cutting the major emitters should undertake. The talks have also become bogged down in rows over key technical issues.  Negotiators arrived in Madrid two weeks ago with the words of the UN secretary general ringing in their ears - Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told delegates that \"the point of no return is no longer over the horizon\". Despite his pleas, the conference has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures.  The key question of raising ambition has also been to the forefront of the discussions.  Responding to the messages from science and from school strikers, the countries running this COP are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century.  In a rare move, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. As well as naming names, AOSIS members were angry at the pressure being put on the island nations to compromise on key questions. \"We are appalled at the state of negotiations - at this stage we are being cornered, we fear having to concede on too many issues that would undermine the very integrity of the Paris agreement,\" said Carlos Fuller, AOSIS chief negotiator. \"What's before us is a level of compromise so profound that it underscores a lack of ambition, seriousness about the climate emergency and the urgent need to secure the fate of our islands.\" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, is taking a hard line on the promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015.  They are insisting that the pledges to cut carbon in the years up to 2020 be examined and if the countries haven't met their targets, these should be carried over to the post-2020 era. Signed in 2015, the Paris climate pact saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions.  This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises.  \"The Paris agreement talks about the leadership of the developed countries, it talks about the peaking of greenhouse gases earlier in these countries, so we need to see these things,\" said Ravi Shankar Prasad, India's chief negotiator.  \"You have to honour what you agreed.\" The developed world see the Indian stance as a tactic, where they are trying to go back to the way things were before Paris, with the richer countries doing the most of the heavy lifting while China, India and others do less.  Some politicians in attendance at this meeting believe there's too much self interest and not enough countries looking at the bigger picture. \"Frankly, I'm tired of hearing major emitters excuse inaction in cutting their own emissions on the basis they are 'just a fraction' of the world's total,\" said the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama. \"The truth is, in a family of nearly 200 nations, collective efforts are key. We all must take responsibility for ourselves, and we all must play our part to achieve net zero.  \"As I like to say, we're all in the same canoe. But currently, that canoe is taking on water with nearly 200 holes - and there are too few of us trying to patch them,\" Mr Bainimarama said. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A critical 12 months in the battle against rising temperatures begins in Madrid this week, as UN delegates gather for key talks.  The 25th Conference of the Parties, or COP, will see negotiators from almost 200 countries in attendance.  Ahead of the meeting the UN secretary general has warned that the world is at the point of no return.  Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the global response to date has been \"utterly inadequate\".  The conference takes place amid a welter of bad news on climate change in recent days.  The World Meteorological Organisation announced that  greenhouse gas concentrations reached their highest recorded level  in 2018. The UN Environment Programme showed that  there's a huge gap between the plans that governments currently have on the table to cut emissions and what's needed  to keep under 1.5C. Keeping to that guardrail will need a five-fold increase in the carbon cutting ambitions of countries.  The UN Secretary General warned delegates ahead of the meeting \"the point of no return was no longer over the horizon\". \"We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,\" Mr Guterres said. As well as demanding that the negotiators increase their level of carbon cutting ambition at this meeting, Mr Guterres announced that the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney will take on the role of UN Special Envoy on climate action and climate finance. Yes, this annual event, the Conference of the Parties or COP was due to take place in the Chilean capital Santiago this year.  It was cancelled by President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era due to ongoing civil unrest in the country .  After a brief flurry of diplomatic activity,  Spain said they would step into the void and host the conference , with Chile still leading the diplomatic negotiations.  The Spanish argue that it is critical to support a UN process that depends on global co-operation in the face of rising nationalism around the world. \"COP25 will reaffirm that multilateralism is the best tool to solve global challenges such as climate change,\" said Spain's minister for the ecological transition Teresa Ribera.  \"Neither the UN nor the international community have let the climate agenda fall, despite the challenges to organise this event, because this is a vital moment to drive implementation and action. Spain immediately offered to organise the summit in record time. There is no turning back.\" The hope is that this meeting will concentrate the minds of international diplomats on the huge scale of the challenge.  Governments have promised to update their climate pledges by 2020, when  the COP will be held in Glasgow .  But so far, despite the urgings of scientists, major improvements in pledges have been slow to materialise. Many nations have aspirations to carbon neutrality in the long term, but they have been slow to put specific short-term commitments on the table.   \"Some 70 countries have pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, this must be carried on at Madrid COP,\" said Sonam Wangdi, the Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group in UN climate change negotiations. \"There must be an agreement among us all to do our fair share. If it doesn't happen in Madrid it could be too late for 2020 pledges.\"   The hope for Madrid is that the meeting can avoid major bust ups and keep edging forward. It also has to overcome two possible banana skins - loss and damage, and carbon markets. This issue has dogged the negotiations for several years now, but the likelihood is that it will come to a head in Madrid.  Loss and damage are the impacts that can't be prevented or adapted to by countries.  Some experts consider \"loss\" to apply to the complete destruction of something such as human lives, habitats and species. \"Damage\" refers to something that can be repaired, such as roads or buildings.  So the examples that are given are rising sea levels which can't be prevented, or storms that are connected to rising temperatures.  Back in 2013, under pressure from developing countries, the climate talks set up a special forum to discuss loss and damage. In Madrid the delegates must decide how to progress. Poorer nations want the loss and damage to have teeth within the UN setup, and more importantly, funding. \"Everybody has to recognise that there is a need and then there must be a funding window,\" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs.  \"Once you have that, where the funding comes from is secondary, right now there is no fund.\" Rich countries fear that the whole question is a way of tying them into paying out for sea level rise and storms for centuries ahead, because the bulk of the carbon in the atmosphere comes from fossil fuels used by the developed world.  As the conference starts, 150 environmental groups including climate activists Naomi Klein and Lidy Nacpil have written to ministers calling for adequate funding for loss and damage. They say the combination of climate disasters and debt can prove toxic for developing nations.  \"The climate crisis has been causing death, despair and displacement in the global south,\" said Harjeet Singh from Action Aid.  \"This bullying of the countries hardest hit by climate change, by those that got rich from extracting and consuming fossil fuels, must end now.\" Hot air is in fact one of the big concerns with the question of carbon markets.  In the past richer countries have often paid for carbon reduction projects in poorer nations.  The wealthy have then been able to count the carbon saved from these projects against their own emissions.  These schemes were discredited amid accusations of fraud and \"double counting\" where both the poor and the rich countries counted the same emissions reduction as part of their plans.  Article six of the Paris agreement set out to reform these carbon markets, recognising that if they were transparent and effective they could really help to raise ambitions.  Discussions on how the new arrangements would work were due to be completed in Katowice at the COP last year but  they ran into real problems . Brazil resisted all attempts to curtail double counting. Other countries wanted to carry forward carbon credits from older schemes.  Some also want to be able to sell or carry forward credits if they overachieve on their existing carbon cutting plans, which observers feel would encourage countries to set a low bar in terms of commitments.  Experts often call these types of credits \"hot air\" as they are more an accounting exercise than a real reduction in carbon dioxide.  The amount of \"hot air\" is huge, running into billions of tonnes of carbon. Experts fear that these could undermine the integrity of the Paris pact if they are allowed to continue.  \"We believe that these markets will have an impact but they must result in real reductions on the ground,\" said Sonam Wangdi from the LDCs. \"The option is needed and the carbon market is one of the tools - but there needs to be environmental integrity and they need to be transparent and there needs to be real reductions there.\"  Trying to get unanimous agreement between almost 200 countries on how to tackle climate change is a really big ask. The agreement that was struck in Paris in 2015 only came about after six long years of snail pace negotiations.  It was the deal that diplomats had hoped to strike in the failed Copenhagen COP in 2009.  So if the goal is that countries have new promises in place by the end of 2020, Madrid is an important snapshot of what can realistically be achieved. Countries often tend to hold back on their pledges until they see what others are likely to do. Madrid will give a sense of whether there is a willingness from some of the larger countries, like India, China and the EU, to show leadership.  \"After 30 years of advocacy and optimism, we see COP 25 as the last opportunity to take decisive action,\" said Ambassador Janine Felson from Belize, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.  \"Anything short of a vastly greater commitment to emission reduction through new national plans that are consistent with our fight for a 1.5 degree world, greater momentum towards honouring outstanding 2020 climate finance commitments, a new climate finance goal suitable for achieving a 1.5 degree world and tangible support for disaster risk reduction and reconstruction in small island and developing states will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe.\" This could be the last year in which a US team will play a part in the negotiations. On 4 November President Trump sent a formal letter to the UN, which has triggered the 12-month countdown to the US pullout.  The Americans are due to leave on 4 November 2020, one day after the next US presidential election and five days ahead of the critical COP26 in Glasgow.  The US has been playing a more truculent role in recent negotiations , joining with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia to prevent the conference welcoming a key IPCC report on how the world can keep temperatures under 1.5C this century. Over the past couple of years the US has also supported side events promoting coal and will likely continue to do so in the future. Even if they do withdraw completely next year, that will only be from the Paris agreement part of the negotiations. The US will still be party to the UN climate convention. It is unlikely they will stop sending teams to the conferences. Just a year ago, Greta Thunberg attended the Katowice COP as a relatively unknown Swedish student who was taking direct action in striking from school for the climate. A year later and she has become a global icon who can get a standing ovation from diplomats by calling out their hypocrisy on rising temperatures.  Greta's dedication to the cause has been enhanced by her decision to cross the Atlantic in a yacht to attend the Santiago meeting. Now she is on another boat on her way back to Madrid. She is due to arrive a few days after the start. Her participation and her speech will likely make headlines around the world.  Conferences like the COP are rooted in a traditional UN diplomatic that requires a unanimous agreement on steps forward. While environmental campaigners and others can observe, there is limited input from young people, school strikers and other voices. Nordic countries are attempting to do something different this year with ministers from Sweden, Finland and Iceland inviting five young people from different countries to take part in discussions with politicians and report back from COP25.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tom Edgington BBC News The Supreme Court has reversed a decision to block plans for a controversial third runway at Heathrow Airport. It means that developers  can now seek planning permission for the project,  which faces opposition from environmentalists and local residents. Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving about 80 million passengers per year. The airport currently has four terminals and two runways. Supporters of a new runway say it would boost international trade and provide many new jobs. Building the new runway would involve diverting rivers, moving roads and rerouting the M25 through a tunnel under the new runway. The proposal also includes upgrades to existing terminals two and five and plans to build new car parks. Heathrow Airport has said the project would be funded privately. The expansion would benefit passengers,  boost the wider economy by up to \u00a361bn and create up to 77,000 local jobs by 2030,  according to the Department for Transport. More than 40% of the UK's exports to non-EU countries now go through Heathrow, according to its chief executive John Holland-Kaye. He said a third runway was vital in order to strengthen international trade links. \"If we don't expand our only hub airport, then we're going to be flying through Paris to get to global markets,\" he said. Heathrow Airport also says it would introduce legally-binding environmental targets - including on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. Local and environmental groups have dismissed Heathrow Airport's assurances and have argued that a new runway would mean unacceptable levels of noise and pollution, as well as adding to the UK's carbon emissions from the increased number of flights.  The proposal also  \"makes a mockery\"  of the government's 2050 carbon neutral strategy, according to Green MP Caroline Lucas. Rupa Huq - the Labour MP for neighbouring Ealing Central and Acton - has labelled the plan \"completely nuts\", saying: \"Heathrow is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in Europe.\" Campaign groups have also voiced opposition. \"The impact on local people could be severe for many years to come,\" said John Stewart, who chairs the Hacan group. \"Disruption from construction, the demolition of homes, the reality of more than 700 extra planes a day.\" In all, 761 homes are expected to go,  including the entire village of Longford. Heathrow has said it would pay the full market value plus 25% for properties in its compulsory purchase zone, as well as for some houses in the surrounding areas. The third runway plan has been talked about for many years. The Labour government approved a third runway in 2009, with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown saying it was needed for economic reasons. But the plan was later scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. David Cameron, who became prime minister after Mr Brown, ruled out a Heathrow expansion  \"no ifs, no buts\". In 2015 an  Airports Commission , set up to look at London's airport capacity problems,  recommended Heathrow as the preferred site for a new runway  - a plan  which was approved  under Theresa May's leadership. The decision was opposed by several local MPs, including Boris Johnson, whose Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat is next to Heathrow. He offered to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop the runway's construction. However, when  MPs voted in favour of the third runway  in 2018, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - was away in Afghanistan.  On 27 February 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled the decision to allow the expansion was unlawful because it did not take climate commitments into account. However, the Supreme Court's decision has ruled the strategy was legitimately based on previous, less stringent, climate targets at the time it was agreed. The airport can now make a planning application, although this could take more than a year.  It still has to persuade a public inquiry that there is a case for expansion, and the government will have the final say.  Meanwhile environmentalists are expected to continue challenging the project at every stage in the courts - including the European Court of Human Rights.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Errors have been found in a recent study suggesting the oceans were soaking up more heat than previously estimated. The initial report suggested that the  seas have absorbed 60% more than previously thought . But a re-examination by a mathematician showed that the margin of error was larger than in the published study.  The authors have acknowledged the problem and have submitted a correction to the journal. This video can not be played According to the  last major assessment  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's oceans have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But the new study claimed that every year, for the past 25 years, we have put about 150 times the amount of energy used to generate electricity globally into the seas - 60% more than previous estimates.  The authors suggested that this had huge implications for the way that the world is warming.  If far more heat than previously believed was going into oceans, it also meant that far more heat than we thought has been generated by the warming gases we have emitted in the world to date.  Therefore more heat from the same amount of gas means the Earth is more sensitive to CO2.  Since 2007, scientists have been able to rely on a system of almost  4,000 Argo floats  that record temperature and salinity in the oceans around the world. But prior to this, the methods used to measure the heat in the ocean had many flaws and uncertainties.  The team involved in the study used a new approach to measuring the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air. They believed that this allowed them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when data from a global network of stations became available.  The key element in this methodology is the fact that, as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air.  \"When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,\" said lead author Dr Laure Resplandy from Princeton University. \"So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases.\" They were discovered by a mathematician,  Nicholas Lewis , who has long been critical of climate models, arguing that they are over-sensitive to emissions of carbon dioxide.  He reviewed the paper when it was published and found what he termed \"serious (but surely inadvertent) errors in the underlying calculations.\" The key element deals with the amount of uncertainty in the measurements. As a result of the increased margin of error, the findings on the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans can't be definitively supported.  They've put their hands up and acknowledged the error.  Ralph Keeling, who co-authored the study said in a statement that he takes responsibility for the \"oversights\" and would like to \"thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing an apparent anomaly in the trend calculation to our attention.\" \"These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation.\"  The authors say they have now reworked their calculations and submitted a correction to the journal, Nature, which originally published the study. This video can not be played They have issued an editor's note about the issue.  \"We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update.\" According to the scientists involved in the original study, the ocean is still probably warming more than the estimate used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But the errors mean that it has a larger range of probability - between 10% and 70%. This is in line with other studies. \"Our error margins are too big now to really weigh in on the precise amount of warming that's going on in the ocean,\" Ralph Keeling said. \"We really muffed the error margins.\" UPDATE:  The original version of this story was published before the errors in the study came to light.

{"id":null,"body":"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he will pay $4.5m (\u00a33.2m) to cover some of the lapsed US commitment to the Paris climate accord. He said he had a responsibility to help improve the environment because of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the deal. The withdrawal was announced last June and sparked international condemnation. It will make the US in effect the only country not to be part of the Paris accord. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels. As part of the agreement, the US had pledged $3bn to the Green Climate Fund, set up by the UN to help countries deal with the effects of global warming. The money promised by Mr Bloomberg does not aim to cover this, but the US contribution to the UN's climate change secretariat. \"America made a commitment and, as an American, if the government's not going to do it then we all have a responsibility,\"  Mr Bloomberg said on CBS . \"I'm able to do it. So, yes, I'm going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organisation as though they got it from the federal government.\" His charity, Bloomberg Philanthropies, offered $15m to cover a separate climate change shortfall last year. It said the money would go to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In January,  President Trump said the US could \"conceivably\" return  to the deal if it treated America more fairly. \"It's an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they (the Obama administration) signed,\" he told reporters. Mr Bloomberg said he hoped that by next year Mr Trump will have reconsidered his position on the deal. \"He's been known to change his mind, that is true,\" he said. \"America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.\" The deal unites all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change for the first time in history. Coming to a consensus among nearly 200 countries on the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions is regarded by many observers as an achievement in itself and has been hailed as \"historic\". As well as the limit on global temperatures, it includes a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity and a requirement for rich countries to help poorer nations by providing \"climate finance\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Wind, solar and hydro power installations pose a growing threat to key conservation areas, say researchers.  Researchers found that over 2,200 green energy plants have been built within the boundaries of the Earth's remaining wilderness.  They say that around 17% of renewable facilities globally are located in protected regions.  A further 900 plants are now being developed in key areas of biodiversity. The amount of renewable energy facilities in use around the world has essentially tripled over the last 20 years.  Green energy facilities are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, with wind and solar needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce the same amount of energy. Now researchers say that often these solar, wind and hydro schemes have been built in areas of environmental significance and pose a threat to key natural habitats. The team mapped the locations of around 12,500 of these installations. They found that more than 2,200 were built in wilderness, protected regions and key biodiversity areas. Some 169 were found in strictly managed protected areas where no development activity at all should occur.  \"Energy facilities and the infrastructure around them, such as roads and increased human activity, can be incredibly damaging to the natural environment,\" said lead author Jose Rehbein, from the University of Queensland, Australia. \"These developments are not compatible with biodiversity conservation efforts.\" The researchers say that energy projects like solar farms often necessitate new roads, and the people who come in to service these installations sometimes build settlements near them. Western European countries are the worst offenders at the moment, with Germany having 258 facilities in key conservation areas.  Spain has similar numbers of installations, while China has 142. One big concern from the researchers is the likely expansion of the demand for renewables particularly in Africa and Asia.  The researchers say the number of active renewable energy facilities within important conservation lands could increase by 42% over the next eight years.  In countries like India and Nepal, for example, hydropower is seeing a real boom. Nepal has over 100 facilities within protected areas, while India has 74 under development in important conservation zones. \"In most cases it's just weak planning,\" said Dr James Allan from the University of Amsterdam, a senior author on the paper.  \"So in the Selous world heritage site in Tanzania, the government has just given the go ahead for a massive dam, a huge hydropower project which will really destroy a large area of that national park.\" Over the past 18 months, there has been a growing concern about the extinction crisis being seen around the world and much research has been published linking it to climate change.  But while many developing countries are doing their best to tackle rising carbon emissions through switching to renewable energy, the irony is that they are increasing the threat to species when these facilities are installed in protected areas.  The authors of the report say that greater care must be taken when planning and permitting renewable facilities.  \"If we let these developments go ahead, the biodiversity will be gone long before climate change starts affecting it,\" said Dr Allan.  \"We acknowledge that there is a risk that we will arm some sceptics, but anyone who reads the work will understand that we are not saying that renewables are bad, we just need to put them in the right places.\" The study has been published in the journal, Global Change Biology.

{"id":null,"body":"By Reality Check team BBC News Watching your favourite show or listening to your playlist has never been easier. A virtually endless supply of film, music and TV can be streamed and downloaded almost instantly. But at what cost to the environment?  Vast amounts of energy are needed to keep data flowing on the internet and demand will only increase as our reliance on digital services grows. Some of that energy is generated from clean energy sources, but much of it comes from burning carbon-based fossil fuels, which scientists believe is a contributing factor to rising global temperatures. The latest  report by climate scientists  demonstrates the scale of the dangers faced from carbon emissions. \"How we power our digital infrastructure is rapidly becoming critical to whether we will be able to arrest climate change in time,\" says Gary Cook, IT sector analyst at Greenpeace. So, could cutting down time spent on the internet really make a difference to energy consumption and global warming? The entire information technology (IT) sector -  from powering internet servers to charging smartphones - is already estimated to have the same carbon footprint as the  aviation industry's fuel emissions .  And it is on course to consume as much as 20% of the world's electricity by 2030, according to  Anders Andrae,  who is based at Huawei Technologies.  Streaming video accounts for the biggest big chunk of the world's internet traffic.  Watching video over the internet at home is roughly the same as having two or three old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs on, say Prof Chris Preist and Dr Dan Schien, of the University of Bristol's computer science department. As well as the power used by these devices, energy is consumed by the networks that distribute the content. More demand for the technology also means more energy is required to store and share vast amounts of information. This is where data centres come in - often in vast buildings that house computer servers that store, process and distribute internet traffic. The servers themselves require a great deal of cooling.  Most of the world's internet traffic goes through these data centres and they host streaming platforms such as Netflix, Facebook and YouTube.  These data centres are estimated to currently consume at least 1% of the world's electricity every year, a figure that is expected to rise in the future.  They also account for about 0.3% of global CO2 emissions. Mr Andrae says data centres being built across the world need to be fed by renewable energy to minimise these emissions. The European Commission-funded Eureca project found that data centres in EU countries consumed 25% more energy in 2017 compared with 2014.  The lead scientist, Rabih Bashroush, calculated that five billion downloads and streams clocked up by the song Despacito, released in 2017, consumed as much electricity as Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic put together in a single year.  Every time you sit down to watch or listen to something online, the amount of energy consumed might change. It depends on a range of factors including the efficiency of the device.  Terrestrial broadcast TV is a lot more efficient than current streaming technologies for TV channels that are watched by a large number of people, say Prof Preist and Dr Schien. Mobile phones tend to be the most energy-efficient - more so than a TV or a laptop.  It depends how you stream too. A mobile using wi-fi consumes less energy than one connected to 3G or 4G.  Even if you're not using your device, by having home wi-fi active, you're still consuming energy, says Prof Preist. \"So in the home, a lot of the energy consumption comes from us all having our network equipment on 24 hours a day.\" Some data centres can be more efficient than others. Keeping them in cooler locations, underground for example, can cut down on large quantities of energy required for cooling.  The International Energy Agency's (IEA) latest report suggested that despite the increased workload for data centres, which will triple by 2020, the amount of electricity used will only go up by 3%.  This is down to continued improvements in the efficiency of servers and data centre infrastructure, and a move to bigger but more efficient centres.  Some of the large technology companies have been praised for being more open about how efficient they are. Facebook expects its new  data centre in Singapore  will be powered by 100% renewable energy, something that Apple says already happens with all its  global facilities.  Many other firms have committed to reaching that goal.  Companies also make up for the amount of non-renewable energy that they consume by supporting renewable energy projects. Scrutiny of less well known and smaller companies and their energy consumption should be a priority, says Mr Bashroush. \"More attention needs to be paid to the smaller data centre facilities that are off the radar, this is where the next big opportunity to save energy is, the big players are not that bad in comparison,\" he says.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst This video can not be played Extreme events linked to climate change, such as the heatwave in Europe this year, are occurring sooner than expected, an ex-chief scientist says. Prof Sir David King says he's been scared by the number of extreme events, and he called for the UK to advance its climate targets by 10 years. But the UN's weather chief said using words like \u201cscared\u201d could make young people depressed and anxious. Campaigners argue that people won't act unless they feel fearful. Speaking to the BBC, Prof King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to be scared. We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didn\u2019t foresee these sorts of extreme events we\u2019re getting so soon.\u201d This video can not be played He said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014. He referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role. Several other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language. The physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: \u201cDavid King is right to be scared \u2013 I\u2019m scared too.\"  \u201cWe do the analysis, we think what\u2019s going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way.  \"Then we have a human response to that\u2026 and it is scary.\u201d Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world. It\u2019s the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public.  This video can not be played Dr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but he\u2019s concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis \u2013 and also to mental health problems amongst the young.  \u201cWe are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit\", he said. \u201cBut I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much.  \u201cWhen I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought it\u2019s better not to have children.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.\u201d He said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range. The polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment. He also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: \"I  would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice.\" It seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. The Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath are  counselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiet y.  However, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act. We tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014.  The consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature. But the models hadn\u2019t been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this year\u2019s extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian \u2013  described by Nasa  as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201ca nightmare scenario\u201d. Others mentioned  severe ice melting at the poles ; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years;  record wildfires in the Arctic  and an unprecedented  two large cyclones in Mozambique  in one year.  Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us he\u2019d been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive. \u201cI have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,\u201d he said.  Few of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time. They\u2019re alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change.  Prof King argues that some changes were not well forecast. The loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in Greenland Then there\u2019s this year\u2019s French heatwave. Dr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change. She told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years.  In a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon.  In other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating.  \u201cWith European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,\u201d she said. \"It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude.\"  Researchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said.  With some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change.  And it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change.  Prof King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. \u201cScientists like to be certain,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? I\u2019m going to say \u2018very high\u2019. \u201cI can\u2019t say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.\u201d       He continued: \u201cIf you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared.  \u201cBut we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.\u201d  Pierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly. Prof King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040. Some of the IPCC scientists we contacted didn\u2019t share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level.  Others agreed with him. Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: \"Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections.   \u201cIn my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections. \u201cWhat is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.\u201d  Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice This video can not be played The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of \"much of the natural world\". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement.  Sir David said: \"Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. \"If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\" The naturalist is taking up the \"People's Seat\" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting.  \"The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,\" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already \"a matter of life and death\" for many countries. He explained that the world is \"nowhere near where it needs to be\" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to \"right the ship\" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. This video can not be played This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  report  on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. But  a recent study  showed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years.  In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say \"decisive action in the next two years will be crucial\".  This video can not be played Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider.  So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start.  Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting.  The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment.  But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work.  While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020.  Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided.  \"The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,\" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. \"It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!\" Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute.  Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. \"We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,\" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. \"Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast.\" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. \"Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues.  \"Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture.\" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. \"We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement.  Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting.  \"A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. \"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.  Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.  A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect.

{"id":null,"body":"The UK's oldest polar bear has died after he was \"unexpectedly taken ill\" on Friday. The 22-year-old bear, named Victor, suffered terminal kidney failure at Yorkshire Wildlife Park near Doncaster. A team of vets tried to help but had no choice but to put him to sleep, park managers said. During his life, which was all spent in captivity, the \"prolific breeder\" fathered 13 cubs and is survived by his grandchildren around the world. Park management said Victor had been a \"great ambassador for his species\" and would be \"greatly missed by everyone\". Born at Rostock Zoo in Germany in 1998, Victor was moved to Rhenen in the Netherlands and was part of the European breeding programme.  After being retired from the programme, he was taken to Yorkshire Wildlife Park in 2014. The park said he \"spent his days enjoying the lakes and expansive habitat\" at their reserve. During this time, he was joined by four other polar bears - Pixel, Nissan, Nobby  and, most recently, Rasputin .  The directors of Yorkshire Wildlife Park thanked the vets who \"responded so quickly\" after Victor was taken ill. They also paid tribute to the \"dedicated staff who have loved and cared for Victor since his arrival and who today are saddened at the loss of one who was a favourite for staff and visitors alike\". \"Victor was a great ambassador for his species, inspiring generations and drawing attention to the plight of his species in the wild and the threat of climate change.  \"He will be greatly missed.\" Yorkshire Wildlife Park is home to the only polar bears in England.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst A new report on the potential of heavy industry to combat climate change offers a rare slice of optimism. Sectors like steel, chemicals, cement, aviation and aluminium face a huge challenge in cutting carbon emissions. But a group including representatives from business concludes it is both practical and affordable to get their emissions down to virtually zero by the middle of the next century. The report's been described as wishful thinking by some environmentalists.  The group, the  Energy Transitions Commission  (ETC), says we can. It calculates that industrial emissions can be eradicated a cost of less than 1% of global GDP, with a marginal impact on living standards. The ETC - a coalition of business, finance and civil society leaders from energy producers and users - supports the aim of the 2015 Paris climate deal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, or at the very least, well below 2C. It sees benefits to society of cutting industrial emissions because this would save the costs associated with pollution and climate change impact. It would also generate economic growth through technological innovation and increased productivity of resources. The commission says this will require rapid improvements in energy efficiency across the whole economy. This should be combined with vastly increased wind and solar electricity to power cars, vans, manufacturing, and a significant part of domestic cooking, heating and cooling.  The focus of the report is on the tough nuts of climate change: cement, steel, chemicals, trucking and aviation. These sectors account for close to a third of total global carbon dioxide emissions, but on current trends that is likely to increase just as the rest of the economy is cleaning up. The report says it is technically possible to decarbonise all of them by the middle of the next century. It recommends: The authors say we can decarbonise the difficult sectors at costs per tonne of carbon dioxide saved of $60 or less for steel, $120 or less in cement, and $270 or less in the case of plastics. The chair of the ETC, Adair Turner, said there was an \"incredible disconnect\" between the urgency of the climate problem and the \"glacial\" pace of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, where emissions are captured then pumped underground.  \"Making the transition involves a step change in the way we do things,\" said the former CBI chief. \"It can be done and it won't break the bank ... but it will require real urgency from policy-makers, from business leaders and from investors and financiers.\" Lord Turner admitted that having the climate change sceptic Donald Trump as US President was unhelpful.  Environmentalists have applauded the ETC for laying out a possible pathway for emissions cuts, but are highly sceptical that the required level of urgency can be generated. They note that the UK government, for instance, says it leads the world in climate policy, yet has just agreed a \u00a330bn road-building programme and a new runway for Heathrow, which will increase emissions. Kevin Anderson, a professor of economics at Manchester University, points out that the UK's proud record of carbon emission cuts does not count statistics on key polluting sectors. \"If we include CO2 from international aviation; shipping; imports and exports - then UK plc has made no real dent in CO2 since 1990, nor have the other climate-progressive EU nations.  \"Until we dispense with our rose-tinted specs we'll not even recognise the problem - let alone the solutions. No nation is even approaching doing what 'they feasibly can' - and we will continue to fail whilst we worship the god of Mammon and ephemeral economics,\"  he tweeted . John Sauven, head of Greenpeace UK, applauded the ETC's initiative - but warned that better thinking about solutions was urgently needed.  \"To rise to the climate challenge, we'll need a much deeper rethink of the way we move around, build houses, power our economy, and grow our food,\" he said. Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said the report \"provides a key piece of evidence for governments who pledged at the Paris summit to keep global warming well below 2C, because it shows them what that entails for some crucial industries. \"However, the Commission is very clear that these transitions won't happen by themselves - it's going to need governments to step forwards with policies, and to do so quickly.\" Follow Roger on Twitter:  @rharrabin A brief history of the Earth's CO2 Cities lead the way on curbing carbon Turning carbon dioxide into rock - forever Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UK scientists say the recent fires in Australia are a taste of what the world will experience as temperatures rise.  Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office Hadley Centre said we are \"seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3C\". While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's \"common sense\" that human-induced heating is playing a role.  Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record. UK researchers have carried out a rapid analysis of the impact of climate change on the risk of wildfires happening all over the world. Their study looked at 57 research papers published since the last major review of climate science came out in 2013. All the studies in the review showed links between climate change and the increased frequency or severity of fire weather. This is defined as those periods of time which have a higher risk of fire due to a combination of high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and high winds.  The signal of human-induced warming has become clearer in different parts of the world with the passage of time. A paper published last year suggests the impact of climate change could be detected outside the range of natural variability in 22% of land that's available for burning. \"Overall, the 57 papers reviewed clearly show human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire,\" said Dr Matthew Jones, from the University of East Anglia, and the lead author of the review. \"This has been seen in many regions, including the western US and Canada, southern Europe, Scandinavia and Amazonia. Human-induced warming is also increasing fire risks in other regions, including Siberia and Australia.\"  However, the review says that the dramatic fire situation witnessed in Australia in recent months is \"challenging to diagnose\". Naturally occurring weather patterns have played a significant role in creating the right conditions for wildfires. Conditions in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific have meant hot, dry spells across the country. But the influence of human-driven climate change is also in the mix.  \"This (the fires) would have happened naturally but we can be confident that they have been made hotter because of man-made climate change,\" said Prof Betts.   Speaking at the launch of the global review, he pointed to the fact that Australia is now about 1.4C warmer than the global average temperature was in the pre-industrial period.  \"Temperatures in December in Australia, that have occurred recently, they are extreme for now but they would be normal under a world getting on for three degrees of warming, so we are seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3 degrees,\" Prof Betts explained. Right now, the world has warmed around 1C since the 1850s. Even with current government plans to limit emissions of CO2, the world is on course for around 3C of warming by the end of this century. Other experts involved in the review say that people are seeing the signal of global warming \"with their own eyes\" when it comes to wildfires and heatwaves.  \"These are impacts we are seeing for one degree of global climate change. The impact will get worse as long as we don't do what it takes to stabilise the world's climate,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia in Norwich. \"And what it takes is to bring CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases down to net zero emissions. If we don't do it, we will have much worse impacts - so what we are seeing in Australia is not the new normal, it's a transition to worse impacts.\"  The details of the papers included in the review can be found at the  ScienceBrief online platform .

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales environment correspondent This video can not be played Parts of Wales that have suffered industrial decline are set to benefit from a long-awaited plan to tackle climate change, the UK government has said. Its aim is to create  250,000 new green jobs  in the UK while cutting emissions. Port Talbot is cited as a potential location for one of four  \"carbon capture clusters\" . Funding is also promised to help develop pioneering  mini nuclear reactors . The firm behind the plans, Rolls-Royce, has previously said it is likely the first such facility would be built at the site of the former Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in Gwynedd. Full details of the prime minister's 10-point plan are set to be unveiled later on Wednesday. The government has said it will also include funding to develop mass-scale production of electric vehicle batteries, including in north Wales. A ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans is to be brought forward to 2030, 10 years earlier than planned. Boris Johnson said a green industrial revolution would be powered \"by the wind turbines of Scotland and the north-east, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales\". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales was \"exceptionally well-placed to drive forward decarbonisation of energy, industry and domestic heating and be a centre for innovation in green technology\". The government said it wanted to become a world leader in carbon capture technology, catching emissions from industry and storing them deep underground or turning them into other chemicals. It is experimental stuff that has not properly taken off yet.\u00a0  The prime minister said he is setting aside a further \u00a3200m on top of \u00a3800m already pledged to create \"carbon capture clusters\" to focus on making breakthroughs, and supporting 50,000 jobs. Four are promised before 2030. Port Talbot could be one of the areas to benefit - alongside the Humber, Teesside, Merseyside and Grangemouth in Scotland. Government advisers, the Climate Change Committee, have said carbon capture could have an important role to play for Wales given it has a higher share than the rest of the UK of emissions in \"hard to reduce\" sectors such as industry. That accounted for 29% of Wales' emissions in 2016, with 11% coming from iron and steelworks alone. For advancing nuclear power, \u00a3525m of funding is pledged, including money for developing the next generation of small,  modular reactors . A consortium led by Rolls-Royce has announced plans to build up to 16 of the mini plants in the UK, with Trawsfynydd a favoured location. A total of \u00a3240m is also being announced for new hydrogen production facilities, and while it is not yet clear where these would be located, industry experts have long argued Wales has a lot of potential in this field.\u00a0  The announcement also repeats the prime minister's ambition to generate enough offshore wind power to supply every home in the UK, though funding in this area looks set to be focused on Scotland and the north-east of England.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Twenty-five years of satellite observations have been used to reconstruct a detailed history of Antarctica's ice shelves. These ice platforms are the floating protrusions of glaciers flowing off the land, and ring the entire continent.  The European Space Agency data-set confirms the shelves' melting trend.  As a whole, they've shed close to 4,000 gigatons since 1994 - an amount of meltwater that could all but fill America's Grand Canyon. But the innovation here is not so much the fact that the shelves are losing mass - we already knew that; relatively warm ocean water is eating their undersides. Rather, it's the finessed statements that can now be made about exactly where and when the wastage has been occurring, and where also the meltwater has been going. Some of this cold, fresh water has been entering the deep sea around Antarctica where it is undoubtedly influencing ocean circulation. And this could have implications for the climate far beyond the polar south. \"For example, there've been a couple of studies that showed that including the effect of Antarctic ice melt into models slows global ocean temperature rise, and that can actually lead to an increase in precipitation in the US,\" explained Susheel Adusumilli from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. Mr Adusumilli and colleagues analysed all of the observations made by Esa's long series of radar altimeter missions - ERS-1, ERS-2, EnviSat and CryoSat-2. These spacecraft have tracked the change in thickness in Antarctica's ice shelves since the early 1990s. Combining their data with ice velocity information from other sources, and the outputs of computer models - the Scripps group has gained a high-resolution view of the pattern of melting during the study period. As might be expected, there's been quite a lot of variation, with mass loss and gain, even within the same individual shelf. And the rate of mass loss over time has also gone up and down. But the overall picture is clear: the shelves are wasting. \"We see that melting is always above the steady state values,\" Mr Adusumilli told BBC News. \"You need some amount of melting just to keep the ice sheet in balance. But what we've seen is an amount of melting by the ocean that is more than is needed to keep it in balance.\" The fascinating aspect to this study is that the scientists can also now trace precisely where at depth the melting is occurring. Some of these floating platforms of ice (the biggest is the size of France) extend many hundreds of metres below the sea surface. The researchers can tell from the satellites' data whether the wastage is  happening close to the thinnest parts of the shelves or at their fronts, or deep down in those places where the glacier ice coming off land first becomes buoyant and starts to float.  \"That kind of information can tell us a lot about the melting processes involved, how they're working - and the effects that meltwater can have,\" said Scripps' Prof Helen Fricker. \"So, it's not just that the shelves are melting. It's how they're melting - and where their meltwater is being injected into the ocean.\" Thinning ice shelves do not contribute directly to sea-level rise. That's because the floating ice has already displaced its equivalent volume of water.  But there is an indirect consequence. If the shelves are weakened, the land ice behind can flow more quickly into the ocean, and this will lead to sea-level rise. This is happening, and has been measured by other satellites. Prof David Vaughan is the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey. He was not connected with the study which is  published in Nature Geoscience .

{"id":null,"body":"By Mark Kinver Environment reporter Researchers have found a way to tackle a disease that threatens thousands of hectares of Alpine forests each year. Needle bladder rust causes Norway spruce needles to yellow and fall out, causing a significant reduction in growth. Scientists in Austria have unlocked a natural defence mechanism that the species can use to fend off the potentially fatal pathogen. The findings have been published in the BMC Genomics journal. Disease is one of the major threats facing trees around the globe, especially in a warming world where many organisms are finding themselves living in an environment in which they are under increasing levels of stress. It is widely predicted that invasive pathogens, and the insects that can spread them, are expected to thrive in a world experiencing climate change. In evolutionary terms, harmful pathogens developed alongside plants' attempts to protect themselves, creating a multi-millennia cold war between biological kingdoms. It is a natural defence mechanism that a team of scientists utilised to create a system to protect the Norway spruce from needle bladder rust. \"Our research seeks to curb this disease unravelling the molecular defence mechanism of Norway spruce against needle bladder rust infection,\" explained co-author Carlos Trujillo Moya, a researcher from the Austrian Research Centre for Forests. Dr Trujillo Moya and colleagues have continued to monitor Norway spruce trees in the mountains of Austria, allowing the team to select trees that seem to display a resistance to the disease. From these trees, the team were able to generate clones and then study the genes, as well as studying the production of defence chemical compounds. Dr Trujillo Moya told BBC News that trees that displayed a resistance to the needle bladder rust defended themselves via a \"hypersensitive response\". \"This defence mechanism consists in the production of a complex artillery of proteins and chemical compounds that isolate the fungus in the attacked leaves,\" he explained. \"The infected part of the leaf dies in a controlled way and thus prevents the fungus from spreading throughout the rest of the tree. \"This response occurs two to three weeks after the infection and lasts for at least one month.\" The team said the findings represented \"enormous progress\" in the way Norway spruce trees are selected for their resistance to the needle baller rust pathogen ( Chrysomyxa rhododendron ). \"Our finding allows to better identify resistant clones and promote the establishment of replanting programmes by using selected trees, based on most effective hypersensitive defence reponse,\" Dr Trujillo Moya observed. He concluded by saying this research helps tackle one of the main issues facing the ecological and economic sustainability of Alpine ecosystems.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent Snowy winters could become a thing of the past as climate change affects the UK, Met Office analysis suggests. It is one of a series of projections about how UK's climate could change, shared with BBC Panorama. It suggests by the 2040s most of southern England could no longer see sub-zero days. By the 2060s only high ground and northern Scotland are still likely to experience such cold days. The projections are based on global emissions accelerating. It could mean the end of sledging, snowmen and snowball fights, says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist who worked on the climate projections. \"We're saying by the end of the century much of the lying snow will have disappeared entirely except over the highest ground,\" she told Panorama. If the world reduces emissions significantly the changes will be less dramatic, the Met Office says. The average coldest day in the UK over the past three decades was -4.3 Celsius. If emissions continue to accelerate, leading to a global temperature rise of 4C, then the average coldest day in the UK would remain above 0 Celsius across most of the country throughout winter. Even if global emissions are reduced dramatically and world temperatures rise by 2C, the average coldest day in the UK is likely be 0 Celsius.   The Met Office says these temperatures are subject to variation and some years may see days colder than the average. Its projections explore how the UK's climate might change.   \"The overarching picture is warmer, wetter winters; hotter, drier summers,\" Dr Kendon says.  \"But within that, we get this shift towards more extreme events, so more frequent and intense extremes, so heavier rainfall when it occurs.\" The Met Office says we are already seeing dramatic changes in the UK climate. \"The rate and nature of the climate change that we're seeing is unprecedented,\" says Dr Mark McCarthy of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. Most of the country has already seen average temperatures rise by 1C since the Industrial Revolution and we should expect more of the same, he warns. That may not sound like much, but even these small changes in our climate can have a huge impact on the weather and on many plants and animals. The Met Office says there could be significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer. It says the biggest increases will be in the already warmer southern parts of the UK. At the same time extreme weather is expected to become more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves are likely to become more common and last longer, with record temperatures being exceeded regularly. Not every summer will be hotter than the last, the Met Office says, but the long-term trend is steadily upwards, particularly if emissions remain unabated. That high-emissions scenario shows peak summer temperatures could rise by between 3.7 C and 6.8 C by the 2070s, compared with the period 1981 to 2000. If the world succeeds in reducing emissions, these temperature rises will be considerably smaller. The level of detail in the models mean it is possible to see how the climate might change in neighbourhoods across the country. This video can not be played Hayes in west London, for example, is likely to see some of the most dramatic temperature rises of all, the new data suggests. The average hottest day in Hayes was 32C around 20 years ago. If emissions continue to accelerate, the new Met Office data suggests the average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C by around 2070. If global emissions reduce, this temperature rise will not be so severe. \"I mean, I think it's really frightening. That's a big change, and we're talking about in the course of our lifetime. It's just a wake-up call really as to what we're talking about here,\" says Dr Kendon. Summers might not just be hotter, they could be drier too, the Met Office predicts. Summer rain could become less frequent, but when it does rain it is likely to be more intense.  The combination of longer dry periods with sudden heavy downpours could increase the risk of flooding because dry ground doesn't absorb water as well as damp ground. Rainfall is expected to increase in many parts of the country in winter too, the Met Office says. The projections suggest western parts of the UK may get even wetter under a high-emissions scenario. Of course, some years will always buck the trend by being wetter or cooler than others - and there will be significant regional variations. This pattern of wetter winters and more intense summer downpours across much of the country risks putting infrastructure under greater strain. Roads, railways, reservoirs, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure is all designed for the sort of rainfall we have had in the past and much of it may need to be upgraded or even rebuilt to cope with the storms and floods to come. Last week, the UK government announced ambitious new targets for tackling climate change. The new goal is to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emission by 68% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. Boris Johnson hopes the new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19.

{"id":null,"body":"MPs have approved a motion to declare an environment and climate emergency. This proposal, which demonstrates the will of the Commons on the issue but does not legally compel the government to act, was approved without a vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the motion, said it was \"a huge step forward\".  Environment Secretary Michael Gove acknowledged there was a climate \"emergency\" but did not back Labour's demands to declare one. The declaration of an emergency was one of the key demands put to the government by environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion, in  a series of protests  over recent weeks.  Addressing climate protesters from the top of a fire engine in Parliament Square earlier, Mr Corbyn said: \"This can set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the globe. \"We pledge to work as closely as possible with countries that are serious about ending the climate catastrophe and make clear to US President Donald Trump that he cannot ignore international agreements and action on the climate crisis.\"  Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared \"a climate emergency\".  There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal.  It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Read more here Labour's motion also calls on the government to aim to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050 and for ministers to outline urgent proposals to restore the UK's natural environment and deliver a \"zero waste economy\" within the next six months.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst It is frustrating: you buy a new appliance then just after the warranty runs out, it gives up the ghost.  You can\u2019t repair it and can\u2019t find anyone else to at a decent price, so it joins the global mountain of junk. You\u2019re forced to buy a replacement, which fuels climate change from the greenhouse gases released in the manufacturing process. But help is at hand, because citizens in the EU and parts of the USA will soon get a  \"right to repair\" - of sorts.  This consists of a series of proposals from European environment ministers to force manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. At least 18 US states are considering similar laws  in a growing backlash against products which can\u2019t be prised apart because they\u2019re glued together, or which don\u2019t have a supply of spare parts, or repair instructions. European environment ministers have a series of proposals forcing manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. Plans for the EU Ecodesign Directive are complex and controversial. Manufacturers say the proposed rules on repairability are too strict and will stifle innovation. Consumer campaigners complain the EU Commission has allowed firms to keep control of the repair process by insisting some products are mended by professionals under the control of manufacturers.  The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) said: \u201cThis restricts the access of independent repairers to spare parts and information - and that limits the scope and affordability of repair services.\u201d The EEB also wants other products like smart phones and printers included in the legislation. Green groups say legislation under way in Europe and the US represents progress towards saving carbon emissions and using resources more wisely. Libby Peake from the think tank Green Alliance told BBC News: \u201cThe new rules are a definite improvement. We think they could have been better, but it\u2019s good news that at last politicians are waking up to an issue that the public have recognised as a problem for a long time. The new rules will benefit the environment and save resources.\u201d The policies have been driven by some arresting statistics. This is no simple question. Resource analysts say, as a rule of thumb, if your current appliance is old and has a very low energy efficiency rating, it can sometimes be better in terms of lifetime CO2 emissions to replace it with a new model rated A or AA. In most other cases it produces fewer emissions sticking with the old model. There\u2019s another debate about how readily consumers should be allowed to mend appliances. The Right to Repair movement wants products that can be fully disassembled  and repaired with spare parts and advice supplied by the manufacturer.  Some manufacturers fear that bungling DIY repairers will damage the machines they\u2019re trying to fix, and potentially render them dangerous. One industry group, Digital Europe, said: \u201cWe understand the political ambition to integrate strict energy and resource efficiency aspects in Ecodesign, but we are concerned that some requirements are either unrealistic or provide no added value.  \u201cThe draft regulations limit market access, deviate from internationally-recognised best practices and compromise intellectual property.\u201d What should I do with my broken kettle? The British government has welcomed the new rules and will almost certainly need to replicate them if UK firms are to export to Europe. Environment Minister Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey told BBC News resource efficiency was \"key to improving our productivity and making best use of precious resources\".  \"That is why we are supporting measures in the new Ecodesign Directive product regulations to encourage repair and re-use of a range of products.\u201d This is a very different tone from the one adopted by critics of the EU\u2019s previous initiatives on energy efficiency. There were warnings that  forcing vacuum cleaners to use less power  would leave Britain\u2019s floors dirty. It transpired that the rules had forced manufacturers to make  new cleaners that cleaned equally well \u2013 but using less power , thanks to better floorhead design.

{"id":null,"body":"By Lucy R Green Science reporter Insects will be at the heart of worldwide crop losses as the climate warms up, predicts a US study. Scientists estimate the pests will be eating 10-25% more wheat, rice and maize across the globe for each one degree rise in climate temperature. Warming drives insect energy use and prompts them to eat more. Their populations can also increase. This is bound to put pressure on the world's leading cereal crops, says study co-author Curtis Deutsch. \"Insect pests currently consume the equivalent of one out of every 12 loaves of bread (before they ever get made). By the end of this century, if climate change continues unabated, insects will be eating more than two loaves of every 12 that could have been made,\" the University of Washington, US, researcher told BBC News. Prof Deutsch, Joshua Tewksbury and colleagues have conducted a study on a global scale and looked at three different grain crops that are staple foods for billions of people. The study, in the journal Science, uses data from across the globe  to make a mathematical prediction that links the response of insects to temperature with the damage that is done to crops when the climate warms up. Guy Poppy, who is Professor of Ecology at University of Southampton, UK, and works on food security said: \"It is a novel piecing together of several pieces of a jigsaw\". The team put laboratory data from 38 insect species into the mathematical model. They looked to see how the energy use and growth responses of these insects to temperature might affect future crop losses. There is already reckoned to be a direct effect of climate change on crops, with yields declining by about 5% for every one degree increase in temperature. That loss will be 50% higher because of insect damage, said Prof Tewksbury from the University of Colorado Boulder, US. So, this new research suggests the action of pests will accelerate temperature-induced impacts. As the temperature rises insect populations grow and they eat faster. Prof Tewksbury added: \"All of that adds up to bigger eating machines particularly in the temperate zone, like in the bread basket of Europe or in the corn belts of the US. \"In many European countries we're predicting 50-100 % increases in the impact of pests on crops.\" This could mean total losses in European wheat yield of around 16 million tons due to pests. But in the tropics, insects are already closer to the optimal working temperature and a rise in temperature is actually likely to start limiting populations. This would lead to fewer insects and fewer crops being damaged. Some of the world's most productive regions of grain production are in the temperate zone and at risk, including US, France and China. This could be a real problem given that maize, rice and wheat account for 42% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide. Already, 1 in 9 people suffer from chronic hunger across the globe.  Climate models suggest global surface temperatures could rise by 2-5 degrees by 2100. Prof Deutsch thinks that \"by the time we get to a 2-degree warming by mid-century we would be able to detect the kind of change in insect pest damage that we're anticipating\". And there are several other factors that, if put into the team's mathematical model, could make the outcome even worse. These factors include plant pathogens carried by the insects, changed rainfall patterns and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. \"It's a general model. The increase in pest pressure we actually see on the ground will depend on how we grow our crops.  We are going to adapt, but this is the model if we don't.\" Prof Tewksbury told the BBC. Pesticides use is common in Europe and especially the UK. But experts warn that pests may become more resistant to them in a warmer climate. \"It may well mean that we need to shift to using more biological means of controlling pests,\" such as ladybirds, said Prof Poppy. Other adaptive solutions might include shifting planting dates, rotating crops more and planting crops that are more resilient to pests. But as Prof Poppy points out: \"[In the UK recently] we've had snow, we've had peak rainfall and we've had a warm summer. When the growing season has to deal with all those things then that can be a particularly tough challenge.\" Co-author Scott Merrill at University of Vermont told the BBC: \"If we don't do some forward-thinking on this we are going to see real impacts on food insecurity. When we're dealing with pests it shouldn't be 'let's just try for a silver bullet', but more of an integrated strategy using a lot of different tactics\".

{"id":null,"body":"Scientists have described the serious concept of  \"Hothouse Earth\" .  An international team of researchers suggest that global warming will have severe consequences for the planet. They paint a picture of boiling hot climates and towering seas in years to come if temperatures rise by just 2C. That means it could turn some of the planet's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Dr Sarah Cornell is an environmental scientist and one of the researchers behind the report for the Stockholm Resilience Centre. She's described some of the big changes which could happen with a 2C temperature rise - which is the globally accepted amount, according to the  Paris climate agreement. This is something that is very close to Dr Cornell's (and everyone else's) heart. \"Chocolate is just one example of a globally important crop that grows in warm and humid climates,\" she says. But global warming doesn't mean that there will be more places to grow cacao beans - in fact, it's the opposite. A rise in global temperatures causes weather systems to be unpredictable and inconsistent, which would put cacao growing at risk. \"It is about the really intricate pattern of temperature, water flow, light intensity, the nutrients already available in the soil,\" says Dr Cornell. Ice in the areas around the North Pole could melt completely, says Dr Cornell. But it's not just the animals living there which are under threat. \"When you melt the Arctic, you're changing the way that the whole Earth works,\" she says. \"You're changing ice that reflects heat back into space into dark seawater that absorbs incoming solar radiation.\" So it's a vicious circle - the less ice there is to reflect heat away from the Earth, the more global warming accelerates. How can you be a country if you don't have any land? Melting ice means  rising sea levels  - which could put low-lying island nations, such as the Maldives, under the sea. \"It will have all kinds of social consequences because the people who live in these low-lying areas will  have to go somewhere, \" says Dr Cornell. \"There are already  lots of discussions  with people in low-lying Pacific islands talking with Australia and New Zealand about where they can live, and how they can have nationhood while renting land from another country.\" Combine rising temperatures with other human activity such as deforestation, and you have drastic effects on the water cycle. \"When you change landscapes, you change where water can flow,\" says Dr Cornell. \"When you warm the planet and are simultaneously changing the landscape, you're changing the water cycle... in a much less predictable way than it was before.\" Extreme changes to the water cycle can lead to severe floods - and severe droughts. Two years ago, a little brown treefrog called Toughie died in Atlanta, USA, at the age of 12. He was the last known living Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog to exist. Toughie's story is a symbol of the rate of extinction that is being caused as a result of climate change. The extinction of a species even as small as a frog has consequences which we don't yet fully understand. \"We could lose treefrogs, and that doesn't sound important but it's vitally important because it's what we lose with it,\" says Dr Cornell. \"When we're killing species, we probably won't know in advance what the consequences are.  \"But we already know that we're making ecosystems much more vulnerable\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says. The shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.  The report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.  The farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers. But environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid. The CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.   The un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2. The committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.  BBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU. The chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.  \u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d Carbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs. NFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.  \"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.  \"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\" Earlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use. The environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet. \u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d Friends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\" There may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.  A separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted. The CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse. Loss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.  Projections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.  \"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d   Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Australia is enduring a bushfire crisis that has left three people dead, razed more than 150 homes, and prompted warnings of \"catastrophic\" danger. Bushfires are a regular feature in the Australian calendar, but  the blazes in New South Wales and Queensland  have not previously occurred on such a scale and so early in the fire season, officials say. This has led many Australians to ask how closely the fires can be linked to climate change.  The science around climate change is complex - it's not the cause of bushfires but scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense.  But the nation's political leaders are facing a backlash for batting away questions on the subject. On Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to answer a question about climate change, saying: \"My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families.\" This video can not be played When asked the same question, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters: \"Honestly, not today.\"  Some Australians agreed, but others were furious the question was being ignored. Mr Morrison later tweeted to offer \"thoughts and prayers\" to those affected, but critics compared that to rhetoric used by US lawmakers who have opposed gun reforms after mass shootings. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack stoked the most anger, when on Monday he dismissed climate change as the concerns of \"raving inner-city lefties\" who were ignoring the needs of rural Australians. \"We've had fires in Australia since time began,\" he said. The nation's target under the Paris Agreement  - the global deal to tackle rising global temperatures - is a 26-28% reduction in emissions by 2030. Some have criticised that as inadequate for a G20 country.  Last year, the UN reported that Australia - the world's largest coal exporter - was not on track to meet its commitment. Mr Morrison told the UN last year that Australia was doing its bit to address climate change, and \"balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and our economic future\". \"We find it very difficult in general to attribute climate change impacts to a specific event, particularly while the event is running,\" said Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires & Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre. \"But what we do know is that the average temperature in Australia now is running about 1C above the long-term average.\" He added fire seasons were starting earlier and \"the cumulative fire danger\" in many areas was growing. Prof Glenda Wardle, an ecologist from the University of Sydney, agreed: \"It's not every weather event that is the direct result of climate change. But when you see trends... it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change.\" She said there was a \"collective shift\" in the timing and intensity of weather events.  Australian National University climate scientist Dr Imran Ahmed called it a direct link: \"Because what climate change does is exacerbate the conditions in which the bushfires happen.\" \"We will start to see the extreme end of the fire behaviour scale occur more frequently because of the increase of temperatures\", said Dr Thornton.  \"Everything we normally see as variability between a good fire season and a bad season is sitting on top of that extra 1C - and that means that the severe events will occur more frequently.\" This video can not be played But Prof Wardle said the government was \"passing the buck\" on climate change and not doing enough to help stem the rise in global temperatures.  \"It hasn't just been fires, there's been flood, there's the drought,\" she said. \"Every time [the government] has had the chance to take on the big issue of climate change and do something, they choose not to and blame other things like land management.\" Dr Ahmed said the leaders' responses this week were a \"very unfortunate\" reaction to peer-reviewed warnings by leading scientists. \"With that sort of evidence on the ground, it's hard to see that you still have the politics around doubting climate change,\" he said. The Bureau of Meteorology's  State of the Climate 2018 report  said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events and increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. In April,  23 former fire chiefs and emergency leaders issued a letter , warning the government about \"increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events\". It requested a meeting which was declined by the government.

{"id":null,"body":"By Imran Rahman-Jones Newsbeat reporter We know the warnings by now.  2019 is  on course  to be in the top three warmest years on record. The UK government has declared a  national climate emergency . And now, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres  says  the \"point of no return is no longer over the horizon\". That came ahead of the UN's two-week gathering of countries to discuss climate change and set targets - the  25th Conference of the Parties (COP25) . So what really gets done at these conferences - and do they actually work? Many countries have individual targets related to climate change. For example, the UK government has  committed  to cutting greenhouse gas emissions right down to net-zero by 2050. But there are also worldwide targets for countries which take part in the UN climate change summits. The Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, was an international agreement to try to heal the ozone layer, which protects Earth from ultraviolet rays but was being destroyed by man-made chemicals. By last year it was found to be  successfully healing  - the Northern Hemisphere could be fully fixed by the 2030s and Antarctica by the 2060s, according to  a UN report. The COP meetings - which focus on greenhouse gases - started in 1995. But it was 1997 when the first significant targets were set. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed in Japan in 1997, set targets for 37 countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  The targets were different for each country, depending on how developed they were. But the US pulled out in 2001 - because they were unhappy that developed countries had legally binding targets, while less developed nations didn't have binding targets. Canada pulled out in 2011 and a lot of other countries missed their targets. In 2012, the Kyoto Protocol was updated in Doha, Qatar. But the deal only covered Europe and Australia, whose share of world greenhouse gas emissions was less than 15%. However, it paved the way for the Paris Agreement in 2015 - also known as COP21 - which was another significant step in climate change talks. The  Paris Agreement  went further than any other international climate change deal. It was agreed by 195 countries in 2015 and came into force in November 2016. Some of the main pledges were: This video can not be played One of the main differences to the Paris deal was that it allowed countries to submit their own targets - rather than tell countries what their targets were. This got the US and Canada back on board. But since then, the US has started to  withdraw  from the agreement, as President Trump says it's unfair on the US economy. He has said he wants to make it easier for fossil fuel producers in the US. But there's an election in the US in November 2020, and a different president could cancel the withdrawal. Although the Paris Agreement was generally well-received, the UN itself has said it doesn't go far enough. A report from the UN Environment Programme in 2017 says the Paris Agreement only covers a third of the emission reductions needed. It says that the world is still on course to warm by more than 2C. The report recommends putting more ambitious targets in place in 2020. This video can not be played Next year's targets are what's expected to be discussed at this year's COP25 in Madrid. The 2020 summit will be held in Glasgow and countries have committed to submit new and updated national climate action plans. The UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres will tell the meeting that the world is now facing a full-blown climate emergency. He said before the conference: \"In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\" It could be seen as an acknowledgement that while the climate change summits can be a step towards a better future, more needs to be done - and time is running out.

{"id":null,"body":"The Republic of Ireland has declared a climate and biodiversity emergency. A Fianna F\u00e1il amendment to the Oireachtas report on Climate Action was accepted without a vote. In May a national climate emergency was declared by the UK Parliament. In Scotland targets are being set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  to net-zero by 2045 . Dozens of local areas around the UK have also said there is a climate emergency. There is no single definition, but many areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Fine Gael's Hildegarde Naughton, who is chair of the Climate Action Committee, welcomed the outcome as \"an important statement\" but added \"now we need action.\" She said the Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton would bring new proposals to the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) and she looked forward to working \"with all parties and none\" to scrutinise them. Its official.Ireland becomes 2nd country in the world to declare a  #ClimateEmergency  & D\u00e1il also agreed to endorse all the recommendations of the Oireachtas Climate Action Report .Definitely one of the highlights for me as a  @greenparty_ie  TD .My children are thrilled.  pic.twitter.com\/bcQhvYxvqx Green Party leader Eamon Ryan warned that \"declaring an emergency means absolutely nothing unless there is action to back it up.  \"That means the Government having to do things they don't want to do,\" he added. The Fianna F\u00e1il amendment was moved by the party's climate action spokesman Timmy Dooley. However, when the vote came before the House, it was put forward by Deputy Ryan as there were only six TDs in the chamber and none of them were from Fianna F\u00e1il. The Green Party leader said: \"We have declared a climate emergency in our own Irish way.\" Teenage activist Greta Thunberg tweeted that it was \"great news\" from Ireland.   The issue of a biodiversity emergency is to be considered by a citizens' assembly. The Oireachtas Climate Action report come from a citizens' assembly report. Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared \"a climate emergency\".  There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal.  It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Global efforts to tackle climate change are way off track says the UN, as it details the first rise in CO2 emissions in four years. The  emissions gap report  says that economic growth is responsible for a rise in 2017 while national efforts to cut carbon have faltered. To meet the goals of the Paris climate pact, the study says it's crucial that global emissions peak by 2020.  But the analysis says that this is now not likely even by 2030. The report comes days before a major UN climate conference starting in Poland from 2-14 December. For the last nine years,  UN Environment  have produced an assessment of the latest scientific studies on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases.  It highlights the difference between the level of greenhouse gas emissions that the world can sustain to keep temperatures within safe limits, with the levels that are likely based on the promises and actions taken by countries.  This year's report records the largest gap yet between where we are and where we need to be.  Between 2014 and 2016, global emissions of CO2 from industry and the production of energy were essentially stable while the global economy grew modestly - but in 2017 these emissions went up by 1.2% pushed along by higher GDP. While the rise might seem small, it needs to be seen in context of efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C, as recently outlined in a key  IPCC report .  According to the UN, to keep the world below that target, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be 55% lower than today.  \"There is still a tremendous gap between words and deeds, between the targets agreed by governments worldwide to stabilise our climate and the measures to achieve these goals,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and one of the authors of the study. The scientists say that to tackle the gap, nations must raise their ambition five fold to meet the 1.5C goal. Right now, the world is heading for a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century the report says. One key aspect of the study is about the peaking of global greenhouse emissions. The report says that peaking of emissions in 2020 is \"crucial for achieving the temperature targets in the Paris agreement,\" but the scale of the current efforts is insufficient.  The study says that by 2030, around 57 countries representing about 60% of global emissions will have peaked. Nowhere near where the world needs to be. In some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.  Three countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.  The authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.  Undoubtedly, yes. The UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.  They estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.  But the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap. The study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.  The report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.   It says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.  \"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.  \"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\" This report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition.  \"Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, BBC News, Stockholm This video can not be played A landmark report says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s. The report  by the UN's climate panel details the physical evidence behind climate change. On the ground, in the air, in the oceans, global warming is \"unequivocal\", it explained. It adds that a pause in warming over the past 15 years is too short to reflect long-term trends. The panel warns that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all aspects of the climate system. To contain these changes will require \"substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions\". After a week of intense negotiations in the Swedish capital, the summary for policymakers on the physical science of global warming has finally been released. The first part of an IPCC trilogy, due over the next 12 months, this dense, 36-page document is considered the most comprehensive statement on our understanding of the mechanics of a warming planet. It states baldly that, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes in the climate system are \"unprecedented over decades to millennia\". Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface, and warmer than any period since 1850, and probably warmer than any time in the past 1,400 years. \"Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and that concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,\" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of IPCC working group one, who produced the report. Speaking at a news conference in the Swedish capital, Prof Thomas Stocker, another co-chair, said that climate change \"challenges the two primary resources of humans and ecosystems, land and water.  In short, it threatens our planet, our only home\". Since 1950, the report's authors say, humanity is clearly responsible for more than half of the observed increase in temperatures.  This video can not be played But a so-called pause in the increase in temperatures in the period since 1998 is downplayed in the report. The scientists point out that this period began with a very hot El Nino year. \"Trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,\" the report says.  Prof Stocker, added: \"I'm afraid there is not a lot of public literature that allows us to delve deeper at the required depth of this emerging scientific question.  \"For example, there are not sufficient observations of the uptake of heat, particularly into the deep ocean, that would be one of the possible mechanisms to explain this warming hiatus.\" \"Likewise we have insufficient data to adequately assess the forcing over the last 10-15 years to establish a relationship between the causes of the warming.\" However, the report does alter a key figure from the 2007 study. The temperature range given for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, called equilibrium climate sensitivity, was 2.0C to 4.5C in that report. In the latest document, the range has been changed to 1.5C to 4.5C. The scientists say this reflects improved understanding, better temperature records and new estimates for the factors driving up temperatures. In the summary for policymakers, the scientists say the rise in ocean waters will proceed at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past 40 years.  Global mean sea level rise for 2081\u22122100, the document says, is projected to be between 26cm (at the low end) and 82cm (at the high end), depending on the greenhouse emissions path this century. The scientists say ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for 90% of energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. For the future, the report states that warming is projected to continue under all scenarios.  Model simulations indicate that global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to 1850.   Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, from Imperial College London, told BBC News: \"We are performing a very dangerous experiment with our planet, and I don't want my grandchildren to suffer the consequences of that experiment.\" Follow Matt on  Twitter .

Bumblebees are key pollinators of many fruits, vegetables and wild plants. Without them, some crops could fail, reducing food for humans and countless other species. Dr Tim Newbold of University College London (UCL) said there had been some previous research showing that bumblebee distributions are moving northwards in Europe and North America, \"as you'd expect with climate change\".  He added: \"But this was the first time that we have been able to really tie local extinctions and colonisations of bumble bees to climate change, showing a really clear fingerprint of climate change in the declines that we've seen.\" Bumblebee declines are already more severe than previously thought, said lead researcher Peter Soroye of the University of Ottawa in Canada. \"We've linked this to climate change - and more specifically to the extreme temperatures and the climate chaos that climate change is producing,\" he said.  Bumblebees are among the most important plant pollinators. Declines in range and abundance have been documented from a range of causes, including pesticides, disease and habitat loss. In the new study, researchers looked at more than half a million records of 66 bumblebee species from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014. They found bumblebee populations declined rapidly between 2000-2014: the likelihood of a site being occupied by bumblebees dropped by an average of over 30% compared with 1901-1974.  Bees have been hardest hit in southern regions such as Spain and Mexico due to more frequent extreme warm years.  And, while populations have expanded into cooler northern regions, this has not been enough to compensate for the losses. Jonathan Bridle and Alexandra van Rensburg of the University of Bristol described the findings as \"alarming\". Commenting in the journal  Science , they said: \"The new study adds to a growing body of evidence for alarming, widespread losses of biodiversity and for rates of global change that now exceed the critical limits of ecosystem resilience.\" There are around 250 species of bumblebee in the world. According to the  International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN), declines have been documented in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia, caused by a variety of threats that range from habitat loss and degradation to diseases and pesticide use.

{"id":null,"body":"By Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Mountaineering in some parts of the world is becoming riskier because of climate change, climbing experts and scientists warn. They say warming in the Alps has thinned ice and snow cover, resulting into frequent rock-falls and landslides. Their concerns were voiced at a meeting of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation this week. Melting glaciers have also added challenges for mountaineers. Climbing routes have either had to be abandoned or changed because of the increased risks. In some places, climbing seasons have had to be brought forward. A study of mountaineering plans for climbers in the Mont Blanc massif showed numerous changes. Almost all climbing \"itineraries\" for the region had been affected since the 1970s and a few routes no longer existed. In the journal Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research , Jacques Mourey from the University of Grenoble Alpes and colleagues wrote: \"Moreover, periods during which these itineraries can be climbed in good conditions in summer have tended to become less predictable and periods of optimal conditions have shifted toward spring and fall, because the itineraries have become more dangerous and technically more challenging.\" A 2017 study of several summits in the Mont Blanc massif  by a French team showed significant degradation of permafrost between 1850 and 2015. This led to the slopes becoming unstable, causing rockfalls. Findings from a study in the Austrian Alps  have been similar. \"Many of these routes have become extremely dangerous,\" Florian Ritter, from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, and colleagues wrote recently in the journal BioOne Complete. \"Numerous classical ice climbs in the Eastern Alps have become heavily affected by rockfall and falling stones, as well due to rocks melting out at the ice margins... during late summer and autumn.\" The Austrian research also pointed to other factors.  \"While the described processes related to global warming might increase the potential, events are generally triggered by other processes that are less linked to global warming, such as extreme rain events,\" it said. Analysis of guidebooks written for those climbing in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, confirms the changes. \"In the climbing guides, multiple generations of climbers noted the climbing dangers for whole mountain ranges,\" said co-author Arnaud Tremme, a geographer with Wageningen University in the Netherlands. \"The oldest guide out of the dozens of guides used in the research was written 146 years ago, this allowed us to record the changes for a longer period and link these with climate change.\" For the past 10 years, a network of wireless sensors on Mount Matterhorn in the Alps has been streaming data on the condition of steep rock faces, permafrost and prevailing climate. \"Based on the data we have received, we see that the rate of change is quite fast,\" said Jan Beutel, a Zurich-based researcher, who leads the monitoring project. \"As a result, some of the places can't be visited anymore.\" A study on Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand also highlighted difficulties for climbers. Climbers here have to navigate the Tasman Glacier, but this is now becoming more difficult because it's melting. \"One of the interesting results of our study was the spatial variability associated with climate change - the impacts are greater at lower elevations, but much higher on the mountains. Because of the large seasonal snowfall, the effects are somewhat buffered,\" Heather Purdie, one of the authors of a study on the mountain told the BBC. Mountain guides say routes are now becoming more challenging and they have had to adapt. \"Rockfalls are becoming the biggest challenge,\" says Christian Trommsdorff, president of the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations. \"Although impacts of the changing climate differ; on some mountains they are massive, while on others they are not.\" Professional mountaineers in the US say some peaks in the Pacific Northwest that still have glaciated terrain have become increasingly hazardous. In some cases, it is no longer possible for mountaineers to climb them. \"The combination of crevasses becoming un-crossable, overhead icefall hazard increasing and rockfall events occurring regularly has made many classic routes more dangerous and less predictable,\" said Angela Hawse, president of the American Mountain Guides Association.    Although few studies along these lines have been conducted in the Himalayas, mountain guides in the region say climbing is becoming riskier. They say wearing crampons on thin ice and exposed rocks is particularly dangerous. \"It becomes like wearing (ladies') high heels on a marble surface,\" says Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president with the Nepal Mountain Guides Association. \"When there is enough snow and ice, the crampons get their grip but now that is becoming less and less available.\" Nepalese mountain guides say that widening crevasses are also becoming a threat. \"We have noticed that the gaping of crevasses, mainly underneath the surface, are increasing and it appears that is happening because of accelerated melting,\" said Mr Bhote. A number of studies in the Himalayas, mainly in the Everest region, have shown that glaciers there are fast retreating. The Khumbu glacier, that Everest climbers must cross before their ascent, has seen several ponds forming on it and joining up because of its rapid melt. The annual meeting of the International Federation of Climbing and Mountaineering in Cyprus will also be discussing how to operate in the changing circumstances. Mr Trommsdorff agreed that the changing nature of different routes needed to be included in training mountain guides. \"We are starting to do something in this regard but we need more of research and development support,\" he said. \"But we also adapt very well to such changes.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"The UN's climate panel has published the second part of its long-awaited report. The document by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considered the impacts of a warming world, vulnerabilities in human and natural systems and the potential for adaptation.  Human-induced warming is likely to lead to large-scale and potentially irreversible changes in physical systems such as the oceans and the cryosphere (regions covered by snow or ice).  Projections suggest an increase in extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, more intense storms and heat-waves. Melting ice will contribute to sea level rise, with consequences for coastal communities, ecosystems and cities. Ocean acidification is likely to have widespread effects in marine species, including the loss of coral communities. For a more detailed overview of science behind these changes, read the  Q&A on climate change . Even if emissions of greenhouse gases were stabilised soon, climate change and its effects would continue for some time afterwards. This will require adaptation, particularly in developing countries, which are likely to be hit hardest, but also elsewhere.  For example, planning for sea-level increases remains a key challenge for governments of countries with vulnerable coastlines, including several with major cities at risk from rising waters.  New York, for example, unveiled a multi-billion-dollar plan to protect the city following Hurricane Sandy. But other urban centres are at greater risk, and are located in countries that have less money to spend on adaptation. Future changes in freshwater availability are likely to affect sustainable development across the world. Water supplies are likely to increase at higher latitudes and in parts of the wet tropics.  But an increase in heavy rainfall in some of these regions is also likely to bring with it many negative effects, such as a raised risk of flooding and the waterlogging of soils. Over mid-latitudes, and the dry tropics - where water supplies are already stressed - resources are likely to become even scarcer.  Sea-level rise could also adversely affect groundwater resources by leading to the intrusion of salt water into coastal aquifers.  The melting of small glaciers also poses problems. In the Andes, glacial melt water supports river flow and water supply for tens of millions of people during the long dry season. Global warming can force species to move to higher latitudes and higher altitudes where temperatures are better for their chances of survival. It can also cause changes to seasonal events in the life cycle of a species. These include migration and mating, in the case of animals, and blooming, in the case of plant species. Mismatches in the timing of these events can lead to serious consequences.  For example, when migrating birds arrive either before or after food sources are present, it can negatively affect their growth and survival. Crop yields are likely to increase at higher latitudes under some scenarios of global average temperature increase - and depending on the crop. At lower latitudes, especially the seasonally dry tropics, crop yields are likely to fall - even for small temperature increases, increasing the risk of hunger. The increased frequency of both droughts and floods is expected to adversely affect agricultural production. Advances in plant science could help increase yields while at the same time reducing the use of fertiliser and pesticides - though the use of genetic modification to generate more suitable crop varieties remains controversial.  And other strategies such as modernising irrigation could help farmers make the most efficient use of water. But some experts emphasise the importance of tackling food supply problems through societal approaches, such as influencing behaviour, consumption and expectations.  Climate change is likely to affect the health of human populations in a variety of ways. Increased levels of malnutrition will have implications for children's growth and development.  People face a greater risk of death, disease and injury due to heat-waves, floods, storms, fires and droughts. Other effects include an altered burden of water-borne diseases; an increased frequency of cardio-respiratory illness due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone, and the movement of some infectious disease carriers into new regions. There might be some benefits, too: parasites such as malaria could also contract in some present parts of their range, and some regions might see a reduction in deaths from cold exposure. The benefits and costs of climate change for industry, settlement, and society will vary widely by location and scale.  While there may be some positive effects in temperate and high-latitude regions, other parts of the world remain extremely vulnerable. The most at-risk industries, settlements and societies are those in coastal and river floodplains, those whose economies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources, and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially where rapid urbanisation is occurring. Poor communities can be especially affected because they tend to be concentrated in relatively high-risk areas, have more limited coping capacities, and can be more dependent on climate-sensitive resources such as local water and food supplies.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played Environmentalists and observers have been barred from UN climate talks in Madrid after a protest inside the conference.  Around 200 climate campaigners were ejected after staging a sit in, preventing access to one of the negotiating halls.  Protesters said they were \"pushed, bullied and touched without consent.\" In the wake of the disruption all other observers were then barred from the talks.  Observers play an important role in the talks, representing civil society. They are allowed to sit in on negotiations and have access to negotiators on condition that they do not reveal the contents of those discussions.   Just hours after  Greta Thunberg had delivered a powerful speech to COP25 , young campaigners staged a noisy demonstration in front of the main halls where the UN secretary general was due to update the conference on the progress of the talks.  They were expressing a rising sense of disappointment with the slow progress of the conference, which is in marked contrast to the urgency of scientists and the clamour for action from school strikers. As the group banged pots and pans and chanted slogans, UN security staff intervened to move the protestors outside \"abruptly and roughly,\" from the building, protesters said. Julius Mbatia, 25, a climate youth leader in Africa who works with Christian Aid said: \"It's displeasing that young people here to peacefully make the case for strong action on climate change, are being kettled and kicked out of the summit so that the UN climate process can conclude an outcome that will seemingly be weak and doesn't protect their future.\" Around 200 had their badges removed, preventing them from returning to the talks.  The executive director of Greenpeace International, Jennifer Morgan, was one of those who went outside in solidarity with the protestors. Ms Morgan was also barred from entry when she tried to return, despite playing no part in the protest. Earlier in the day, Ms Morgan had sat on a panel with Greta Thunberg - part of an effort by the UN to include the voices of young people around the world. \"I call on the UN secretary general to intervene here to make sure that youth and citizens around the world can engage and have their voices heard in these negotiations - it's absolutely imperative that he get involved,\" Ms Morgan said, speaking outside the venue. The UN described the incident as \"an unfortunate security incident.\" After consultations with observer groups, the UN has agreed to  allow those barred after the protest to return for the rest of the conference. Discontent with the way the talks have been going has been rising in recent days with the sense that major emitting countries are doing all they can to block progress.  The UN on Wednesday released more details about the scale of the challenge.  All countries who signed the Paris agreement are due to put new climate pledges on the table by the end of next year. So far, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by then. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. But many in attendance at the meeting believe that this is far short of where the world needs to be to avoid dangerous levels of warming.  \"Frankly, I'm tired of hearing major emitters excuse inaction in cutting their own emissions on the basis they are 'just a fraction' of the world's total,\" said the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama. \"The truth is, in a family of nearly 200 nations, collective efforts are key. We all must take responsibility for ourselves, and we all must play our part to achieve net zero. As I like to say, we're all in the same canoe. But currently, that canoe is taking on water with nearly 200 holes -- and there are too few of us trying to patch them,\" Mr Bainimarama said. There are also worries that the final statement of ambition from this meeting may be watered down, with all the major decisions kicked down the road towards the key meeting in Glasgow at the end of next year.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Scientists say we have to make \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just issued a report detailing the  impact of global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels .  Across the world we're on course for global warming at double this temperature if we don't change the way we live.      We asked you to put your questions to us relating to this  recent warning of climate change catastrophe . Here's a selection of them.   Lucie asks: how much of an impact can we as individuals really make?  It can seem - and indeed is - quite daunting to think about what contribution we can make as individuals to such a global problem. But the scientists contributing to this report have stressed that our choices really matter.  Two key decisions we make every day are about what we eat and how we travel. Cutting down on red meat can reduce the carbon footprint of our diet significantly. And while every km in a car equals about 130g of carbon, a km on a bike doesn't produce any - apart from what the rider breathes out.   Jaqueline Partington asks: what can I do immediately? I live in a rural area and I need my car.   I'm in a similar situation - my only local bus service to the city was actually cancelled last year because no one was using it.  A key thing you can do - especially if you're in a rural area and have the resources - is to think about generating your own energy. But even cheaper and easier is to adjust your diet. Meat and dairy, according to a huge global analysis published earlier this year, take up more than 80% of global farmland and their production emits significantly more greenhouse gas than cereals and vegetables.  Frank Page asks: will anything we do matter if the US and China don't cut back on coal? You're right -  the bigger picture here is about global action. For countries to be seen as acting in a responsible way as organisations like the IPCC advise them, what needs to happen is for growing economies like China to be involved in climate change-averting action, if they want to be seen as key players on the world stage. The solar power industry in China, for example, is growing quickly. The International Energy Agency projects that  the country will hold 40% of the world's solar power capacity in 2023 .  You might also be interested in: David asks: Will the average family have to give up foreign holidays, with flying now discouraged in favour of other forms of transport?  Certainly, if you stop taking flights - especially long-haul flights - you will reduce your carbon footprint. And there are other ways (if you have the time and the money to spend, that is) to get to some closer destinations. But of course, where and whether you take an annual holiday is entirely your choice.  In the past, economists and scientists have proposed a carbon tax on flights - a tax based on the carbon emissions of a journey. This could be a way in which governments try to influence people's choices.  Nikki Webb asks: why isn't the government making it mandatory for new homes to be built environmentally?   Building in an environmentally friendly way is a complicated issue. The production of cement for concrete, for example, is very carbon-intensive. But if homes built with concrete are highly insulated and have a very long life-span, that could balance out.  Certainly, with a housing shortage in the UK, lower-impact building techniques are certain to gain ground.  And renewable energy will need to be a major part of a lower carbon future. The IPCC report said that renewables will need to produce 85% of our energy supply globally by 2050, and currently they provide about 25%. Luis Aramburu asks: why is nuclear not mentioned in the BBC article? Actually, nuclear, along with the rest of the energy sector, is covered in the IPCC's report. It is a detailed projection of the different future scenarios for our planet and - in reporting it - we didn't focus on nuclear, simply because there were so many other key points to discuss.  You can see how the scientists incorporated that into their work in  the policy maker's summary of the IPCC report .

{"id":null,"body":"Australia's summers have become twice as long as its winters amid increasing temperatures driven by climate change, according to new weather data analysis. The Australia Institute found that summer across most of the country over the past 20 years was about a month longer than in the mid-20th century, while winters had become shorter.  Between 2014 and 2018, summers were found to be about 50% longer. The findings followed Australia's warmest and driest year on record. \"Our findings are not a projection of what we may see in the future. Its happening right now,\" the Australia Institute's Richie Merzian said. The country experienced a devastating bushfire season, which killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals.  While scientists said climate change was not the direct cause of the bushfires, they have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense. This video can not be played In its analysis, the Australia Institute think tank compared official Bureau of Meteorology data from 1999 to 2018 with mid-20th century benchmarks. It found that summer temperatures had lasted 31 days longer than in the 1950s and 1960s, while winter was about 23 days shorter. It noted that some areas, such as the town of Port Macquarie in New South Wales, were experiencing even more drastic changes to the length of seasons, with seven more weeks of traditional summer temperatures than in the 1950s and 1960s. \"Summers have grown longer even in recent years, with the last five years facing summers twice as long as their winters,\" Mr Merzian said. \"Temperatures which were considered a regular three-month summer in the 1950s, now span from early to mid-November all the way to mid-March.\" Mr Merzian said global warming had made Australian summers \"a more dangerous ordeal\" than they used to be. Australia's government faced scrutiny over its climate policies during the devastating bushfire season, with critics accusing Prime Minister Scott Morrison of inaction. Australia is one of the highest emitters of carbon pollution per capita, largely because it is still heavily reliant on coal-fired power. Mr Morrison has insisted that Australia is meeting the challenge \"better than most countries\" and fulfilling international targets. What is Australia doing to tackle climate change?

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales environment correspondent One world problem, one corner of Wales - climate change is already \"happening before our eyes,\" according to a man watching the coastline closely. Aberystwyth is a seaside town which has already had experiences of extreme weather. Five years ago,  properties were evacuated as waves crashed onto the promenade.  It seems as good a place as any to take a look at what impact climate change may be having on communities. Its university is also the base for scientists who are researching the wider climate issues - and how we might adapt. And travel along the nearby Dyfi estuary and you find some of Wales' most important nature reserves and wildlife, which are vulnerable. Alun Williams, cabinet member for carbon management in Ceredigion, said rising sea levels were threatening its flood defences. The local authority is trying to plan how to manage the effects of climate change along the coast. Stood on the shingle ridge which acts as a barrier between land and sea at Tanybwlch beach near Aberystwyth, Mr Williams said: \"The sea is overtopping this bank much more regularly than it used to - it's just a matter of time before it breaks through and moves inland.\" Rising sea levels and more frequent storms mean there are fears this defence could soon be breached. This video can not be played It is an example of how global warming is already affecting Wales - the country's 1,680 mile-long (2,700km) coastline is on the frontline, leaving local authorities like Ceredigion with difficult decisions to make. Mr Williams highlighted one area where the waves have carried an avalanche of pebbles down into the River Ystwyth on the other side of the ridge. Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier.  The council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast. No homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed. Elsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly. \"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\" Mr Williams urged. The changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on. Some 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes \"all around us\". They include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe. \"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\" he said. But overall he claimed there were more \"losers than winners\" for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline. \"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\" he added. The salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences. As a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it. The \"headache\" - as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats. \"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\" Farmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future. Dr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold. Hundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions. \"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\" Dr Corke explained. \"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering. \"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\" she said.  A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to \"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\". \"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market. They require collective action and the government has a central role in making collective action possible,\" she said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent China will aim to hit peak emissions before 2030 and for carbon neutrality by 2060, President Xi Jinping has announced. Mr Xi outlined the steps when speaking via videolink to the UN General Assembly in New York. The announcement is being seen as a significant step in the fight against climate change.  China is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. With global climate negotiations stalled and this year's conference of the parties ( COP26 ) postponed until 2021, there had been little expectation of progress on the issue at the UN General Assembly. However China's president surprised the UN gathering by making a bold statement about his country's plans for tackling emissions.  He called on all countries to achieve a green recovery for the world economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the official translation, Mr Xi went on to say:  \"We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.\" Until now China has said it would peak its emissions by 2030 at the latest, but it has avoided committing to a long-term goal. Emissions from China continued to rise in 2018 and 2019 even as much of the world began to shift away from fossil fuels.  While the Covid-19 crisis this spring saw the country's emissions plunge by 25%, by June they had bounced back again as coal-fired plants, cement and other heavy industries went back to work. Observers believe that in making this statement at this time, the Chinese leader is taking advantage of US reluctance to address the climate question. \"Xi Jinping's climate pledge at the UN, minutes after President Donald Trump's speech, is clearly a bold and well calculated move,\" said Li Shuo, an expert on Chinese climate policy from Greenpeace Asia.  \"It demonstrates Xi's consistent interest in leveraging the climate agenda for geopolitical purposes.\" Back in 2014 Mr Xi and then US-President Barack Obama came to a surprise agreement on climate change, which became a key building block of  the Paris agreement signed in December 2015 . Mr Xi has again delivered a surprise according to Li Shuo. \"By playing the climate card a little differently, Xi has not only injected much needed momentum to global climate politics, but presented an intriguing geopolitical question in front of the world: on a global common issue, China has moved ahead regardless of the US. Will Washington follow?\" There are many questions about the announcement that remain unanswered, including what is meant exactly by carbon neutrality and what actions the country will take to get there.  \"Today's announcement by President Xi Jinping that China intends to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 is big and important news - the closer to 2050 the better,\" said former US climate envoy Todd Stern.  \"His announcement that China will start down this road right away by adopting more vigorous policies is also welcome. Simply peaking emissions 'before 2030' won't be enough to put China on the rapid path needed for carbon neutrality, but overall this is a very encouraging step.\" Most observers agreed that the announcement from China was a significant step, not least because of the country's role in financing fossil fuel development around the world. \"China isn't just the world's biggest emitter but the biggest energy financier and biggest market, so its decisions play a major role in shaping how the rest of the world progresses with its transition away from the fossil fuels that cause climate change,\" said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a UK-based think tank. \"The announcement today is also a major fillip for the European Union, whose leaders recently urged President Xi to take exactly this step as part of a joint push on lowering emissions, showing that international moves to curb climate change remain alive despite the best efforts of Donald Trump and [Brazil's president] Jair Bolsonaro in the run-up to next year's COP26 in Glasgow.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Should aviation be taxed more? Should SUVs be banned? Should wind power be subsidised by taxpayers? These are the sort of the climate-related questions to be pondered by a new \"citizens' assembly\", composed of 110 members of the public. The panel has been selected to reflect key sectors of society and a range of opinion. They will spend four weekends listening to evidence from experts on how climate policy and science will affect the UK. Then they\u2019ll offer their opinions on the best ways for Britain to achieve its demanding law that mandates \"net zero\" carbon emissions by 2050. Net zero describes achieving an overall balance between the emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere. What's the reasoning behind it? The idea for this unprecedented assembly was conceived by MPs on six parliamentary select committees who want to learn more about the public's opinions on climate change. It will solely offer advice for the UK to meet its own Climate Change Act. It will not debate the scientific consensus that climate change is dangerous. Nor will it debate if the net zero target should be brought forward to 2030, as the Extinction Rebellion group has called for. What will the jury members do? Some 30,000 invitations to take part were sent out under a process designed to represent all parts of the UK and differences in race, gender, age and views on climate change. People from both rural and urban areas were selected. Thousands agreed to take part, then these were whittled down to 110. The gathering will include views of all hues \u2013 from people who don\u2019t fear climate change to those who definitely do.  Most of the presentations they experience will come from academics, although think-tanks, NGOs, and industry voices will also be heard. On food, for instance, the assembly will hear opposing views from the National Farmers Union and from the Royal Society of Arts and Commerce, which argues for the need to change the way we farm. The project\u2019s being organised by a charity, Involve. It pledges to \u201cuphold key principles of balance, accuracy and comprehensiveness\u201d.   The assembly\u2019s website says the members of its advisory panel were chosen to represent a broad range of views across different sectors. All the expert advisers are acting voluntarily. Sarah Allan from Involve told BBC News: \"The aim is to give people a say on how the UK tackles climate change, and to give parliament and the government an understanding of what people think and where priorities lie. \u201cThe focus is on how the UK achieves net zero. We will get people to look at trade-offs. They can\u2019t say: 'we want net zero' then vote for doing nothing about it.' She continued: \u201cThe Irish assembly was an incredibly useful tool for decision-makers \u2013 we are very optimistic that the UK climate change assembly will be useful too.\u201d   One of the project\u2019s leaders is Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting - we haven\u2019t done anything on this level before,\u201d she told BBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s huge, and the recruitment (of members) has to be gold standard.\" Will climate sceptics be involved? Ms Whitmarsh explained: \u201cThere will be sceptics who don\u2019t even believe climate change is caused by humans. But even they may want to consider evidence that some climate polices (such as active transport) will have health benefits attached. \u201cThere will be other people who are very worried about climate change \u2013 but they may turn out to be unwilling to take on some of the financial consequences involved. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really interesting.\u201d The  announcement  by the six select committees to hold a citizens assembly on climate change was in direct response to government policy on net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and was announced on 20 June 2019. The net zero policy  became law  on 27 June 2019, making the UK the first major economy in the world to legislate for net zero. The 2019 Conservative party manifesto re-affirmed the government\u2019s commitment to this target. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UK Met Office scientists are forecasting that 2021 will be a little cooler around the world, but will still be one of the top six warmest years.  The La Ni\u00f1a weather phenomenon will see temperatures edge down but greenhouse gases will remain the biggest influence. Researchers say the world will likely be around 1C warmer than the pre-industrial era. It will be the seventh year in a row close to or above this mark. According to Met Office projections, the Earth's temperature for 2021 will likely be between 0.91C and 1.15C above what they were in the years from 1850-1900 with a central estimate of 1.03C The 2021 forecast is slightly lower than in recent years, due to the onset of the La Ni\u00f1a event in the tropical Pacific.  A La Ni\u00f1a develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards the Philippines.  In their place, colder waters from deep in the ocean come up to the surface. It is expected to reduce sea-surface temperatures by 1-2C and will likely do enough to prevent 2021 from setting a new high mark. \"The global temperature for 2021 is unlikely to be a record year due to the influence of the current La Ni\u00f1a, but it will be far warmer than other past La Ni\u00f1a years such as 2011 and 2000 due to global warming,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the Met Office. Researchers say the impact of a natural cooling event like La Ni\u00f1a, while important, is hugely overshadowed by the warming driven by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. There was a strong La Ni\u00f1a in the year 1999-2000, but global temperatures have gone up by 0.4C in the years since then.  This is in line with the estimate of 0.2C warming per decade,  attributed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  to human activities.  \"The variability of the La Ni\u00f1a \/ El Ni\u00f1o cycle is the second most important factor in determining the Earth's temperature but it is simply dwarfed by the forcing effect of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" said Met Office scientist Dr Nick Dunstone. The Met Office says that its experience in forecasting previous annual temperatures gives it confidence in next year's projections.  A year ago, the agency estimated that 2020 would be 0.99C to 1.23C warmer than pre-industrial levels.  Data from January to October this year indicates that the annual temperature will be 1.17C above the 1850-1900 average. 2016 remains the warmest year on record with 2020 vying for second place with 2019.   According to a provisional assessment from the World Meteorological Organization, the warmest six years in global records dating back to 1850 have now all occurred since 2015.  The Met Office expects that 2021 will edge out 2018 for sixth place. Follow Matt on  Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC .

{"id":null,"body":"By Kelsey Vlamis BBC News As the climate warms, birds are shrinking and their wingspans are growing, according to a new study. Researchers analysed 70,716 specimens from 52 North American migratory bird species collected over 40 years. The birds had died after colliding with buildings in Chicago, Illinois. The authors say the study is the largest of its kind and that the findings are important to understanding how animals will adapt to climate change. \"We found almost all of the species were getting smaller,\" said lead author Brian Weeks, an assistant professor at the school for environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan. \"The species were pretty diverse, but responding in a similar way,\" he said. \"The consistency was shocking.\" He said studies of animal responses to climate change often focus on shifts in geographical range or timing of life events, like migration and birth. But this study suggests body morphology is a crucial third aspect. \"That's one major implication,\" he said. \"It's hard to understand how species will adapt without taking all three of these things into consideration.\" The findings showed that from 1978 to 2016, the length of the birds' lower leg bone - a common measure of body size - shortened by 2.4%. Over the same time, the wings lengthened by 1.3%. The evidence suggests warming temperatures caused the decrease in body size, which in turn caused the increase in wing length. \"Migration is an incredibly taxing thing they do,\" Mr Weeks said, explaining that the smaller body size means less energy available for the birds to complete their long journeys. He says the birds most likely to survive migration were the ones with longer wingspans that compensated for their smaller bodies. The scientists aren't exactly sure why warmer temperatures cause birds to shrink. One theory is that smaller animals are better at cooling off, losing body heat more quickly due to their larger surface-area-to-volume ratios. Mr Weeks said the body of specimens was the result of a \"herculean effort\" by Dave Willard, co-author of the study and an ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. In 1978, he started walking around buildings in the mornings during spring and fall migration to collect birds that had collided with buildings. Birds usually migrate at night and are attracted to the artificial light from buildings, causing fatal collisions with windows. Hundreds of millions of birds are estimated to be killed in building collisions each year. \"He didn't have this study in mind,\" Mr Weeks said. \"He just thought it could be useful in the future.\" Over the years, many volunteers and scientists contributed to the collection efforts. Mr Willard measured all 70,716 specimens himself using the same methods, \"the gold standard\" for this type of data, according to Mr Weeks. The paper was  published in the journal Ecology Letters . It builds on a growing body of evidence that suggests animals are shrinking as the climate warms. In 2014, researchers found that alpine goats appeared to be shrinking due to warming temperatures. The same year, another study found salamanders had shrunk rapidly in response to climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough has issued his strongest statement yet on the threat posed to the world by climate change.  In the BBC programme  Climate Change - The Facts , the veteran broadcaster outlined the scale of the crisis facing the planet. Sir David said we face \"irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies\". But there is still hope, he said, if dramatic action to limit the effects is taken over the next decade.  Sir David's new programme laid out the science behind climate change, the impact it is having right now and the steps that can be taken to fight it.  \"In the 20 years since I first started talking about the impact of climate change on our world, conditions have changed far faster than I ever imagined,\" Sir David stated in the film. \"It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies.\"  Speaking to a range of scientists, the programme highlighted that temperatures are rising quickly, with the world now around 1C warmer than before the industrial revolution.  \"There are dips and troughs and there are some years that are not as warm as other years,\" said Dr Peter Stott from the Met Office.  \"But what we have seen is the steady and unremitting temperature trend. Twenty of the warmest years on record have all occurred in the last 22 years.\"  The programme showed dramatic scenes of people escaping from wildfires in the US, as a father and son narrowly escape with their lives when they drive into an inferno.  Scientists say that the dry conditions that make wildfires so deadly are increasing as the planet heats up. Some of the other impacts highlighted by scientists are irreversible. \"In the last year we've had a global assessment of ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland and they tell us that things are worse than we'd expected,\" said Prof Andrew Shepherd from the University of Leeds.  \"The Greenland ice sheet is melting, it's lost four trillion tonnes of ice and it's losing five times as much ice today as it was 25 years ago.\" These losses are driving up sea levels around the world. The programme highlights the threat posed by rising waters to people living on the Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana, forcing them from their homes.  \"In the US, Louisiana is on the front line of this climate crisis. It's losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet - at the rate of of a football field every 45 minutes,\" said Colette Pichon Battle, a director of the Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy.  \"The impact on families is going to be something I don't think we could ever prepare for.\"  Sir David's concern over the impacts of climate change has become a major focus for the naturalist in recent years.  This has also been a theme of his Our Planet series on Netflix. His new BBC programme has a strong emphasis on hope.  Sir David argues that if dramatic action is taken over the next decade then the world can keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C this century. This would limit the scale of the damage.  \"We are running out of time, but there is still hope,\" said Sir David.  \"I believe that if we better understand the threat we face the more likely it is we can avoid such a catastrophic future.\"  The programme said that rapid progress is being made in renewable energy, with wind now as cheap as fossil fuels in many cases. It shows  how technologies to remove and bury carbon dioxide  under the ground are now becoming more viable. But politicians will need to act decisively and rapidly.  \"This is the brave political decision that needs to be taken,\" said Chris Stark from the UK's Committee on Climate Change.  \"Do we incur a small but not insignificant cost now, or do we wait and see the need to adapt. The economics are really clear on this, the costs of action are dwarfed by the costs of inaction.\"  The programme also highlights the rising generation of young people who are deeply concerned about what's happening to the planet.  Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg explained that things can change quickly, despite the scale of the challenge on climate change.  \"The first day I sat all alone,\" she said, speaking of her decision to go on strike from school and sit outside the Swedish parliament to highlight the climate crisis.  \"But on the second day, people started joining me... I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams that this would have happened so fast.\" \"Change is coming whether you like it or not.\"  Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc Climate Change - The Facts was on BBC One on Thursday 18 April at 9pm and is available on iPlayer.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs and Victoria Gill Science correspondents, BBC News Polar bears will be wiped out by the end of the century unless more is done to tackle climate change, a study predicts. Scientists say some populations have already reached their survival limits as the Arctic sea ice shrinks. The carnivores rely on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean to hunt for seals. As the ice breaks up, the animals are forced to roam for long distances or on to shore, where they struggle to find food and feed their cubs.  The bear has become the \"poster child of climate change\", said Dr Peter Molnar of the University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada. \"Polar bears are already sitting at the top of the world; if the ice goes, they have no place to go,\" he said. Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with climate change a key factor in their decline. Studies show that declining sea ice is likely to decrease polar bear numbers, perhaps substantially. The new study,  published in Nature Climate Change , puts a timeline on when that might happen. By modelling the energy use of polar bears, the researchers were able to calculate their endurance limits. Dr Steven Amstrup, chief scientist of Polar Bears International, who was also involved in the study, told BBC News: \"What we've shown is that, first, we'll lose the survival of cubs, so cubs will be born but the females won't have enough body fat to produce milk to bring them along through the ice-free season.  \"Any of us know that we can only go without food for so long,\" he added, \"that's a biological reality for all species\".  The researchers were also able to predict when these thresholds will be reached in different parts of the Arctic. This may have already happened in some areas where polar bears live, they said. \"Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,\" said Dr Amstrup. \"The trajectory we're on now is not a good one, but if society gets its act together, we have time to save polar bears. And if we do, we will benefit the rest of life on Earth, including ourselves.\" Under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, it's likely that all but a few polar bear populations will collapse by 2100, the study found. And even if moderate emissions reduction targets are achieved, several populations will disappear. The findings match previous projections that polar bears are likely to persist to 2100 only in a few populations very far north if climate change continues unabated.  Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface, forming and melting with the polar seasons. Some persists year after year in the Arctic, providing vital habitat for wildlife such as polar bears, seals, and walruses.

{"id":null,"body":"Eight European countries have called for an ambitious strategy to tackle climate change \u2013 and to spend a quarter of the entire EU budget on fighting it. The joint statement says the EU should have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 \"at the latest\". It was signed by France, Belgium, Denmark, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. The group says their plan can \"go hand in hand with prosperity\" and \"set an example for other countries to follow.\" The position paper comes ahead of a major summit of European leaders in the Romanian city of Sibiu, beginning on Thursday, which will discuss the future of Europe and the EU's strategy for the next five years. But not everyone is on board - there are 28 countries in the EU, and several of those absent from the joint position statement are significant players - including Germany. The position of the eight countries is that climate change has \"profound implications for the future of humanity\" and that its impacts are already apparent - citing \"the heat waves and scorching fires of last summer\". The group also say that their citizens are clearly concerned \"as shown by the recent mobilisation of young people\" - in an apparent reference to the wave of walk-outs and marches by schoolchildren across the continent.  The Extinction Rebellion protests in London in April also gained widespread attention and have spread to other countries. \"The EU budget currently under negotiation will be an important tool in this respect: at least 25% of the spending should go to projects aimed at fighting against climate change,\" the paper said. Annual EU budgets have spending limits set by what is known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF).  The current one allowed the EU to spend more than \u20ac900bn  (\u00a3775bn) between 2014-2020. The eight-nation group is eyeing the next framework, which is set to cover 2021-2027. The paper also added that \"as a general principle\" the EU budget should not fund anything which would add to climate emissions. The group wants the EU to announce a policy of zero emissions by 2050 at the United Nations climate summit in September, and strengthen its existing targets at the same time. Adam Fleming, BBC News, Sibiu, Romania This is about the future of Europe as much as the fate of the planet. To some, climate change is the sort of global problem which needs a continent-wide solution and so is a good advert for the existence of the EU.  The leaders who signed up to the Franco-Dutch paper presented this week are aligning themselves with global youth icon Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager leading the climate protests by school children. It also provides a dramatic dividing line in the elections for the European Parliament. And it's an opportunity for Mark Rutte - who could be a contender for the next President of the European Council - to cement his emerging partnership with Emmanuel Macron.  Expect this debate to continue at the gathering of EU leaders in Sibiu on Thursday and to heat up ahead of another summit in June, where the European, ambitious and young(ish) will formally ask the others to adopt tough climate targets before a global conference in the autumn.  At the moment, EU countries are required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from their 1990 levels by 2020, with the aim of raising that to a 40% reduction by 2030. But many are set to miss these targets - some by a wide margin. Some of the eight countries behind the proposal have already made stronger commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron has made climate change a key issue for campaign speeches, while Sweden has already announced plans to become carbon neutral by 2045. Speaking at a press conference with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Monday, Mr Macron said the joint document was \"ambitious\" and that \"we are in the middle of building a coalition on this\". The goal of a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050 is not new -  it was proposed by the European Commission , which is the starting point for European Union legislation, in November 2018.  The Commission's plan was based around the Paris agreement targets of keeping global warming to \"well below\" a 2C increase, and \"pursue efforts\" to reach 1.5 degrees as a limit. But such proposals need the support of the European Parliament \u2013 and ultimately the approval of the European Council, made up of the leaders of each member state. Those leaders will be meeting informally at the summit in Sibiu. The position paper by eight of them is likely to be used as a launching point to bring others on board. But several countries oppose strengthening current commitments, which have proven difficult to stick to just two years after the Paris climate agreement was signed. Political and economic giant Germany is among them, fearing that further action could damage its industry. Poland, which still relies on coal for power, is among the central European nations opposed to such plans. The UK, meanwhile, will be represented at the summit \u2013 by the Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay. Prime Minister Theresa May is not expected to attend.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent, San Francisco Scientists think they can now explain at least part of the recent growth in methane (CH4) levels in the atmosphere. Researchers, led from Edinburgh University, UK, say their studies point to a big jump in emissions coming from just the wetlands of South Sudan. Satellite data indicates the region received a large surge of water from East African lakes, including Victoria. This would have boosted CH4 from the wetlands, accounting for a significant part of the rise in global methane. Perhaps even up to a third of the growth seen in the period 2010-2016, when considered with East Africa as a whole. \"There's not much ground-monitoring in this region that can prove or disprove our results, but the data we have fits together beautifully,\" said Prof Paul Palmer.  \"We have independent lines of evidence to show the Sudd wetlands expanded in size, and you can even see it in aerial imagery - they became greener,\" he told BBC News. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and - just like carbon dioxide - is increasing its concentration in the atmosphere.  It's not been a steady rise, however. Indeed, during the early 2000s, the amount of the gas even stabilised for a while. But then the concentration jumped in about 2007, with a further uptick recorded in 2014. CH4 (methane) is now climbing rapidly and today stands at just over 1,860 parts per billion by volume. There's currently a debate about the likely sources, with emissions from human activities such as agriculture and fossil-fuel use undoubtedly in the mix. But there is a large natural component as well, and a lot of current research is centred on contributions from the tropics. This video can not be played The Edinburgh group has been using the Japanese GOSAT spacecraft to try to observe the greenhouse-gas behaviour over peatlands and wetlands in Africa, and found significant rises in methane emissions above South Sudan centred on the years 2011-2014. Believing the region called the Sudd could be the culprit (soil microbes in wetlands are known to produce a lot of methane), the team started looking through other satellite data-sets to make the link. Land surface temperature observations supported the idea that soils in the region had become wetter; gravity measurements across East Africa also detected an increase in the weight of water held in the ground; and satellite altimeters had tracked changes in the height of lakes and rivers to the south. \"The levels of the East African lakes, which feed down the Nile to the Sudd, increased considerably over the period we were studying. It coincided with the increase in methane that we saw, and would imply that we were getting this increased flow down the river into the wetlands,\" explained Dr Mark Lunt. Much of the extra water likely resulted as a consequence of dam releases upstream. The Edinburgh group  published its findings on Wednesday in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , and, as an update to the story, Dr Lunt is presenting new data here at the American Geophysical Union meeting. He's been looking at  methane observations made by the EU's Sentinel-5P satellite . Its Tropomi instrument sees CH4 at a finer resolution than GOSAT, and it's clear from the European mapper that methane emissions are still elevated over South Sudan. The level of activity is nothing like the same as in the early 2010s, but the Sudd wetlands remain an important source. \"It's a huge area so it's not surprising that it's pumping out a lot of methane. To give context - the Sudd is 40,000 sq km: two times the size of Wales. And being that big we expect to see the emissions from space,\" Dr Lunt told BBC News.

{"id":null,"body":"Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent @BBCJustinR on Twitter Is individual action pointless in the face of climate change? Let's not beat around the bush: the simple answer has to be \"yes\". Think about it:  what difference does one person forgoing a lamb chop for a lentil bake, deciding to catch the bus rather than take their car, or deciding not to jet off for that autumn getaway in the Balearics make if the other 7,699,999,999 of us humans here on Earth don't do anything? It is a dispiriting conclusion and begs an obvious question, and one that I am sure has already occurred to you: why bother? That's exactly what I asked the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg when I met her last month. Rather than fly to her climate change meetings in New York, Greta had opted to be whisked across the Atlantic on a racing yacht. You remember the boat, the one with the bright blue plastic poo bucket? \"The point\", she told me as we bobbed in Plymouth Sound, \"is to create an opinion. By stopping flying, you don't only reduce your own carbon footprint but also that sends a signal to other people around you that the climate crisis is a real thing and that helps push a political movement.\" It's a good answer, and, helps explain why this Swedish teenager with pigtails has captured the world's attention.   My riposte was maybe a little rude: \"So you're trying to make the rest of us feel guilty?\" \"No\", she replied calmly, and explained she doesn't think it is her job to tell other people how to live their lives. Rather, her convictions must guide her own behaviour. \"I don't fly because of the enormous climate impact of aviation per person.\" She acknowledges that she is a special case. \"Many people listen to what I have to say and I appear a lot in media so therefore I influence a lot of people and therefore I have a bigger responsibility because I have a bigger platform.\" Previously, she's tried attending conferences by video link but it just doesn't make as much of an impression. \"I think it will have a bigger impact if I and many other young people are actually there\". And judging by the publicity she's getting, she is right.   But let's be honest, you're no Greta Thunberg. Even if your choices do ripple out into the world and affect a few other people, your decision to eat a little less meat and turn down the thermostat a notch isn't the clarion call that is about to rally the world to the carbon cutting cause, is it? So, why should individuals take action? That is a question for a philosopher. It's their job to wrestle with debates about what principles should guide our behaviour. And I've got just the man. Prof Peter Singer of Princeton University in the US has been described as \"the world's most influential living philosopher\" by New Yorker magazine.   For more on the UK's efforts to tackle CO2 emissions, download the BBC Briefing on energy. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, it has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. Prof Singer describes himself as an expert in practical ethics and he is very clear on this question. He doesn't just think we should all take action but argues there is a very strong moral obligation why we must do so. \"I think this is one of the great moral challenges of the 21st Century, perhaps the greatest moral challenge\", he says. \"If we are not acting, we are endangering everyone who is alive now and also future generations.\" He compares you failing to cut your emissions with you taking a bulldozer and razing the crops of a subsistence farmer in Africa. If you did that, everyone would agree it was wrong, but the greenhouse gases you are responsible for have the same result, he argues. The fact that the cause is invisible gases, and that the effect may be felt in the distant future, doesn't allow each and every one of us to escape the moral obligation to act, Prof Singer insists. The reason is that our right to freedom of action doesn't extend to harming others.   Here's another metaphor. Imagine there's a speed limit on a busy shopping street and someone says, \"I'm going to drive down there with my pedal to the metal, but don't worry, there's a good chance I won't kill anyone.\"  \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA You wouldn't say that's fine, maintains Prof Singer. \"You'd say no, you don't have any freedom or right to put other people in grave danger of being injured or killed.  And that is exactly what we are doing by going ahead with the levels of greenhouse gas emissions we are emitting today.\" He says the fact that each of us only plays a minuscule part in the process doesn't make a jot of difference: the obligation on us all to act remains. I bet most of us instinctively recognise that there is real force in these arguments. So, why aren't all of us doing more to cut our emissions already? Time for the insights of a behavioural psychologist. Step up Professor Kelly Fielding of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. We are not the free-thinking independent spirits we imagine ourselves to be, says Prof Fielding. \"What we know as social psychologists is that people are very influenced by what others do, even though we don't think we are\", she explains. \"It's a paradox. We think we make our own decisions, but the truth is we look to others for guidance about how we should behave.\" When it comes to climate change, the problem is that we just aren't getting the cues we need from our friends and families or, for that matter, from government and business, she says.   Yet surveys show that people all over the world are increasingly worried about climate change. A US poll published in June illustrated the point very forcefully . The Reuters survey found that while 69% of Americans wanted the government to take \"aggressive\" action to combat climate change, only a third would be willing to pay an extra $100 to make it happen.   What the respondents are saying is: \"Yes, there's a problem, but it's not my job to sort it.\" But don't despair, says Professor Fielding. The work of behavioural psychologists suggests It should be possible to flip these findings on their head.   If people need cues from others before they change their behaviour, then all we need to do is get some people to start taking action and others will follow, she argues. Which brings us full circle; all the way back to Greta Thunberg and that super-fast carbon-fibre yacht. As Greta says, our actions are important not because they have a material effect on climate change, but because of the message they send to others.   What you do influences your friends and family and will help create the political space for governments and businesses to take action. That, in turn, is likely to encourage other people and other countries to do more. And it is happening already. Who would have thought that a  company making meat-free burgers could be worth almost $4bn ; that the world's most powerful oil cartel  would brand climate striking students the \"greatest threat\" to the oil industry ; or that climate change would become the key issue for US Democratic presidential candidates? Yes, what I am suggesting is the possibility of a virtuous circle. And yes, this is an argument for us all to be a lot more optimistic about what can be achieved. Because there's another crucial point to remember. Climate change isn't binary: it doesn't just happen or not happen. The crucial question for us all is how much climate change the world will experience. We've already seen a degree of warming. The UN has urged us to try to stay below 1.5 degrees.   So here's the thing: the more action we all take, the less our climate will change and the more liveable the world will be for ourselves, our progeny and all the rest of the magnificent abundance that is life on earth.   Now come on, that's worth making a few lifestyle changes for, isn't it?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Researchers say an area the size of the US is available for planting trees around the world, and this could have a dramatic impact on climate change.  The  study shows  that the space available for trees is far greater than previously thought, and would reduce CO2 in the atmosphere by 25%.  The authors say that this is the most effective climate change solution available to the world right now. But other researchers say the new study is \"too good to be true\".  The ability of trees to soak up carbon dioxide has long made them a valuable weapon in the fight against rising temperatures.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that if the world wanted to limit the rise to 1.5C by 2050, an extra 1bn hectares (2.4bn acres) of trees would be needed.    The problem has been that accurate estimates of just how many trees the world can support have been hard to come by. This new report aims to show not just how many trees can be grown, but where they could be planted and how much of an impact they would have on carbon emissions.  The scientists from ETH-Zurich in Switzerland used a method called photo-interpretation to examine a global dataset of observations covering 78,000 forests.  Using the mapping software of the Google Earth engine they were able to develop a predictive model to map the global potential for tree cover.  They found that excluding existing trees, farmland and urban areas, the world could support an extra 0.9bn hectares (2.22bn acres) of tree cover.  Once these trees matured they could pull down around 200 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, some two-thirds of extra carbon from human activities put into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. This is a quarter of the overall amount of CO2 in the air. \"Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today and it provides hard evidence to justify investment,\" said Prof Tom Crowther, the senior author on the study. \"If we act now, this could cut carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 25%, to levels last seen almost a century ago.\" The researchers identify six countries where the bulk of the forest restoration could occur: Russia (151m hectares), US (103m), Canada (78m), Australia (58m), Brazil (50m) and China (40m).  But they say speed is of the essence because as the world continues to warm then the potential area for planting trees in the tropics would be reduced. \"It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,\" said Prof Crowther.  \"It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies.\" The new study has been welcomed by Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief, who was instrumental in delivering the Paris climate agreement in 2015. \"Finally an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas,\" she said in a statement.  \"A hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector.\" However not everyone was as effusive about the new study. Several researchers expressed reservations, taking issue with the idea that planting trees was the best climate solution available to the world right now.  \"Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies', but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,\" said Prof Myles Allen from the University of Oxford.  Others are critical of the estimates of carbon that could be stored if these trees were planted.  \"The estimate that 900 million hectares restoration can store an addition 205 billion tonnes of carbon is too high and not supported by either previous studies or climate models,\" said Prof Simon Lewis from University College London. \"Planting trees to soak up two-thirds of the entire anthropogenic carbon burden to date sounds too good to be true.  Probably because it is,\" said Prof Martin Lukac from the University of Reading.  \"This far, humans have enhanced forest cover on a large scale only by shrinking their population size (Russia), increasing productivity of industrial agriculture (the West) or by direct order of an autocratic government (China).  None of these activities look remotely feasible or sustainable at global scale.\"  The study has been published in the journal Science. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc.

{"id":null,"body":"More than three billion people will be living in places with \"near un-liveable\" temperatures by 2070, according to a new study.  Unless greenhouse gas emissions fall, large numbers of people will experience average temperatures hotter than 29C.  This is considered outside the climate \"niche\" in which humans have thrived for the past 6,000 years.  Co-author of the study Tim Lenton told the BBC: \"The study hopefully puts climate change in more human terms\". Researchers used data from United Nations population projections and a 3C warming scenario based on the expected global rise in temperature. A UN report found that even with countries keeping to the  Paris climate agreement , the world was on course for a 3C rise.  According to the study, human populations are concentrated into narrow climate bands with most people residing in places where the average temperature is about 11-15C. A smaller number of people live in areas with an average temperature of 20-25C.  People have mostly lived in these climate conditions for thousands of years.  However should, global warming cause temperatures to rise by three degrees, a vast number of people are going to be living in temperatures considered outside the \"climate niche\".  Mr Lenton, climate specialist and director of the global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, conducted the study with scientists from China, the US and Europe.  He told the BBC: \"The land warms up faster than the ocean so the land is warming more than three degrees. Population growth is projected to be in already hot places, mostly sub-Saharan Africa, so that shifts the average person to a hotter temperature.  \"It's shifting the whole distribution of people to hotter places which themselves are getting hotter and that's why we find the average person on the planet is living in about 7C warmer conditions in the 3C warmer world.\" Areas projected to be affected include northern Australia, India, Africa, South America and parts of the Middle East.  The study raises concerns about those in poorer areas who will be unable to shelter from the heat.  \"For me, the study is not about the rich who can just get inside an air-conditioned building and insulate themselves from anything. We have to be concerned with those who don't have the means to isolate themselves from the weather and the climate around them,\" Mr Lenton said.  Mr Lenton says the main message from the team's findings is that \"limiting climate change could have huge benefits in terms of reducing the number of people projected to fall outside of the climate niche.  \"It's about roughly a billion people for each degree of warming beyond the present. So for every degree of warming, we could be saving a huge amount of change in people's livelihoods.\"  Is the world's biggest iceberg about to break up? 2019 was Europe's warmest year on record Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief Environment correspondent The UK government must tell the public small, easy changes will not be enough to tackle climate change, warn experts. Researchers from Imperial College London say we must eat less meat and dairy, swap cars for bikes, take fewer flights, and ditch gas boilers at home. The report, seen by BBC Panorama , has been prepared for the Committee on Climate Change, which advises ministers how to cut the UK's carbon footprint. It says an upheaval in our lifestyles is the only way to meet targets. The government has passed a law obliging the country to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It is \"going further and faster than any other developed nation to protect the planet for future generations\", a government spokesperson told BBC Panorama. \"If we can go faster, we will.\" But the new report warns major shifts in policy across huge areas of government activity are needed to keep the public onside. Chris Stark, the Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change, tells Panorama the government's plan for cutting emissions is \"not nearly at the level of ambition required\".  \"Every bit of policy now needs to be refreshed,\" he warned in an interview with BBC Panorama. The new report, called Behaviour Change, Public Engagement and Net Zero, amounts to an extensive \"to-do\" list for government.   It says subsidies for fossil fuels have to go and taxes on low-carbon technologies must be cut. At the same time, consumers need to be given far more information on the environmental consequences of their actions. It also urges the government to consider introducing a carbon tax, increasing the prices of carbon-intensive products and activities. It is an ambitious agenda but necessary, the report says, if Britain is to achieve its Net Zero ambitions. \"These changes need not be expensive or reduce well-being,\" the report concludes, \"but they will not happen at the pace required unless policy first removes obstacles to change in markets and consumer choice.\" Food currently accounts for 30% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report says we need to make a significant shift towards lower-carbon foods, particularly towards more plant-based diets.  Producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Some animals, like cows and sheep, also produce and burp up methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. The Committee on Climate Change's official recommendation to government is that a 20% cut in red meat and dairy is needed - the emissions from the other 80% will have to be matched by CO2 that has been captured and stored permanently in order to meet the net zero ambition. The report implies a bigger shift in diets could be needed, and says one way to get people to change will be to emphasise the health benefits this could bring. Another will be to give people much more information on the environmental impact of different foods.  It calls for mandatory carbon impact labelling on products, on till receipts, and via shopping websites and apps. Once consumers understand the environmental impact of different food choices, the report argues, government should begin to increase the price of foods that involve high emissions. It suggests this could be done by cutting farm subsidies - more than 70% of which go to livestock - and by raising VAT on these products. Home heating is the single biggest challenge in terms of reducing UK emissions, according to Chris Stark of the Committee on Climate Change. It accounts for 21% of a household's carbon footprint and it will be costly to bring it down. With 30 million homes and 30 years to decarbonise, he argues, \"simple arithmetic\" suggests we need to \"decarbonise\" one million homes every year, starting now. The Behaviour Change report has a whole catalogue of policy recommendations here.  As with electric vehicles, decarbonisation of UK electricity creates opportunities for low-carbon heating systems, in particular air-source heat pumps, which extract heat from air outside the home and remove cold air from inside. The report recommends a \"rebalancing\" of the tax and regulatory costs on energy, which currently fall more heavily on electricity than gas. VAT on installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems should be removed. At the same time, consumers need to be offered a range of incentives to encourage the use of low-carbon technology. According to Chris Stark: \"We haven't even started nibbling away at that heat challenge in any real sense. We need a real plan, and the sooner we do, the cheaper it will be overall.\" Transport currently accounts for 34% of a household's carbon footprint. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.   It says what's needed is a \"modal shift\" to public transport, walking and cycling and believes the public can be encouraged to do this, in part, because of the health benefits it would bring. However, it recognises the UK's progress in decarbonising electricity creates an opportunity for consumers to reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles and urges greater subsidies for new electric car purchases. Electricity companies need to be encouraged to introduce smart EV charging systems so customers can charge their vehicles when electricity is cheap or when renewable power is plentiful and there needs to be a massive rollout of charging infrastructure along motorways, in towns and in cities. Here, the report says policy-makers need to focus on the 15% of the population that are estimated to take 70% of flights. It calls for an \"Air Miles Levy\" to discourage what it calls \"excessive flying\", something the Committee on Climate Change has  already proposed .  The idea is to penalise frequent flyers, while not raising prices for people taking an annual holiday. It says air miles and frequent flier reward schemes have to go and passengers need to be given much more information about the emissions generated by flights.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The construction of large-scale dams has played a surprising role in limiting rising seas, say scientists. Over the past century, melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of sea water have driven up ocean levels. But  this new study  finds that dams almost stalled the rising seas in the 1970s because of the amount of water they prevented from entering the oceans. Without them, the annual rate of rise would have been around 12% higher. Measuring how much the seas have risen over the past 100 years or so is a difficult task for scientists.  Researchers found that there was a gap between how much water they knew had gone into the oceans compared to how much those oceans had actually risen by over the past century.  In this new work, the authors revisited information about sources and measurements to come up with a new, more accurate estimation. As well as the melting of glaciers and the thermal expansion of the seas from heat energy entering the waters, the researchers found that water storage facilities such as dams and reservoirs had made a significant impact on sea levels throughout the period. There are around  58,000 large dams  in the world right now with many of them constructed over the past 60 years.  The 1950s to 1970s saw a building boom with several large-scale constructions completed, including the Kariba Dam in Zimbabwe, the Bratsk Dam in Siberia and the Aswan High Dam in Egypt. When the full impact of these giants came on stream in the 1970s, their ability to block water from going into the sea slowed the ongoing rise in global sea level. \"A large part of this dip is because sea level [rise] was almost brought to a halt because of the amount of water stored in dams,\" said lead author Dr Thomas Frederikse, from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"So by building dams, we almost stopped sea level rise for a decade or so.\" The study finds that overall sea level has risen by approximately 1.56mm per year between 1900 and 2018.  The largest contributors to rising seas over most of the 20th century have been melting glaciers which have responded faster to a warmer world.  Over this whole period, the authors believe that sea level would have been around 12% higher without the influence of dams and reservoirs.  However, the influence of dams in holding back the waters began to fade in the 1990s.  Concerns were growing about the environmental impact of large dams, and the number of projects began to decline.  At the same time, the growing influence of climate change spurred an increase in sea levels through increased ice loss from Greenland and greater thermal expansion of the waters as more heat energy went into the oceans. All these factors have seen the rise in sea levels accelerate over the past 30 years and it is now running at 3.35mm per year. So could a new programme of dam building help save the world from the rising waters? Earlier this year, a team of researchers  produced a paper  on how Europe might avoid the worst impacts of rising seas by building a huge dam across the North Sea. But Dr Thomas Frederikse doesn't think adding extra barriers would now work. \"At the height of the dam building, we were able to slow sea level rise by about 0.8mm per year. \"And now we're seeing sea levels rising in the last 10 years by about four millimetres per year.\" \"So it means that you have to build five times the amount of dams that we built in that period to stop the current rate of sea level rise.\" \"I think that's impossible.\" The better and much cheaper option according to Dr Frederikse is to cut emissions of CO2, faster and deeper than at present. The study has been published in the journal Nature.  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The German government and regional leaders have agreed on a plan to phase out coal-fired power stations by 2038, involving compensation of about \u20ac40bn (\u00a334bn; $45bn).  The end date for burning brown coal (lignite) - the dirtiest type of coal - could be brought forward to 2035, depending on the progress made. Germany has more than 250,000 workers in renewable energy sectors - far more than in the coal industry.  Coal is a big driver of global warming. The \u20ac40bn compensation will target four German states which have lignite mines and coal-fired power plants: Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Brandenburg. Much of the money will go into new infrastructure projects for coal-dependent areas and retraining workers for new jobs there.  Mines and utilities will also get compensation for the lost production. The compensation for closing coal-fired power stations in western Germany is set at \u20ac2.6bn, and for those in the east at \u20ac1.75bn. There are some fears that the shutdown could trigger electricity shortfalls, as nuclear power is being phased out within two years.  The government will draft a law this month for exiting from coal, which it hopes to get passed by parliament in mid-2020.  Coal currently powers about one-third of Germany's electricity, and more than half of that relies on burning lignite. Germany is the world's biggest lignite producer. \"Germany has embarked on something really big. And I'm sure that we'll manage this,\" said Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. Meanwhile, Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said \"we're the first country to be finally exiting from nuclear and coal\". In 2017 consumption of lignite in Germany was 44% of the total in the EU, followed by Poland (16%), the Czech Republic and Greece (both 10%), Bulgaria (9%) and Romania (7%), the EU's Eurostat agency reports.  In that year, 359m tonnes of lignite was delivered to power plants in the EU, producing electricity and heat, along with 150m tonnes of hard coal.  Germany aims to generate at least 65% of its electricity from renewables - that is, carbon-neutral sources - by 2030.  The exit from coal consumption is part of the EU's drive to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. Most of the 28 EU states aim to become carbon-neutral by 2050  - that is, carbon emissions should be balanced by carbon-reduction measures such as tree-planting. Poland, however, relies heavily on coal and has a temporary exemption. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement nearly 200 countries agreed on wide-ranging measures to curb emissions, after scientists warned that global temperatures must not rise more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Update 16th June 2020: An earlier version of this article included a video in which the BBC's David Shukman looked at the massive scale of Germany's coal-mining operation. However it was not made clear that this was originally filmed in 2014 and so the video has been removed. Is this the beginning of the end of coal?

They have enabled the scientists to link for the first time the high temperatures of the period with high levels of atmospheric CO2. The results have been  published in the journal Climate of the Past . In their scientific paper, the team shows that some plants were able to harvest carbon dioxide more efficiently for photosynthesis - the biological process that harnesses light from the Sun to produce food for the plant. They say their findings may hold clues for how the dynamics of plant life could shift as current CO2 levels rise to meet those of the distant past. The team drilled 100m down to near the bottom of the now-dry lake bed, located in the crater of a long-extinct volcano. The crater is about a kilometre across. Here, biological material has been fossilised, including the remains of plants, algae, spiders, beetle, flies, fungi and other living things from a warm period known as the early Miocene Epoch. Average global temperatures are thought to have been between 3C and 7C higher than today, and ice largely disappeared from the poles. There is debate among scientists about levels of CO2 in the period, which is one reason this study is so interesting.  \"The amazing thing is that these leaves are basically mummified, so we have their original chemical compositions, and can see all their fine features under a microscope,\" said lead author Tammo Reichgelt, from the University of Connecticut in Storrs, US. He says they are preserved so perfectly that microscopic veins and stomata - the pores which allow leaves to take in air and release water during photosynthesis - are visible. The scientists analysed the different chemical forms of carbon - or carbon isotopes - within leaves from a half-dozen tree species found at various levels in the deposit. This helped them estimate the carbon content of the atmosphere at the time.  They concluded it was around 450 parts per million (ppm).  Previous studies - mainly using marine organisms - have suggested it was significantly lower, around 300 ppm. That is similar to those in pre-industrial times, and not enough to account for the much higher temperatures of the early Miocene. Human emissions have now pushed CO2 levels to about 415 ppm. They are expected to reach 450 ppm in the next few decades - the same level experienced by those forests in New Zealand 23 million years ago.  The researchers also analysed the geometry of the leaves' stomata and other anatomical features, and compared them with those of modern leaves. They showed that the trees were unusually efficient at sucking in carbon through the stomata, without leaking much water through the same route - a key challenge for all plants. This allowed the trees to grow in marginal areas that otherwise would have been too dry for forests. The researchers say this higher efficiency was very likely mirrored in forests across the northern temperate latitudes, where more of the Earth's landmass is located. When CO2 levels rise, many plants increase their rate of photosynthesis, because they can more efficiently remove carbon from the air, and conserve water while doing so. Data from Nasa satellites shows a \"global greening\"  effect mainly due to rising levels of CO2 released by human activities over recent decades.  It has been estimated that a quarter to a half of the planet's vegetated lands have seen increases in leaf volume on trees and plants since about 1980. The effect is expected to continue as CO2 levels rise. But the authors of the new report say we shouldn't assume this is necessarily good news. Increased CO2 absorption will not come close to compensating for what humans are pouring into the air. And, because much of today's plant life evolved in a temperate, low-CO2 world, some natural and agricultural ecosystems could be seriously disrupted by higher CO2 levels, along with the rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation they bring. Not all plants can take advantage, and among those that do, the results can vary depending on temperature and availability of water or nutrients. There is evidence that when some major crops photosynthesise more rapidly, they absorb relatively less calcium, iron, zinc and other minerals vital for human nutrition. \"How it plays out is anyone's guess,\" said Dr Reichgelt. \"It's another layer of stress for plants. It might be great for some, and horrible for others.\" The deposit is located on a farm near the southern New Zealand city of Dunedin. In the ancient crater lake, successive layers of sediment built up from the surrounding environment over tens of millions of years. The lake was deep and had low oxygen levels at its bottom, which means that any prehistoric leaves that sank down there stayed relatively well-preserved, despite being 23 million years old. These include countless leaves from a sub-tropical evergreen forest. The deposit has a layered structure with blackish organic matter alternating with bands of white-ish silica-rich material laid down by algae that bloomed each spring. The feature was recognised only within about the last 15 years; scientists dubbed it Foulden Maar. It is the only known deposit of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, and far better preserved than the few similar ones known from the north. Tammo Reichgelt said he felt a big responsibility and \"a strange sort of reverence\" working with fossils of this quality that have lain undisturbed for so long.  He described excavating the fossil material from a pit dug into deposits in the crater.  It was exposed to the elements, \"very windy, sunny and saturated with rain\". That made the work very challenging. \"The largest leaf I ever found was on a wet day and the brittle rock crumbled in my hand with the leaf on it\", he told the BBC. \"There was no saving it.  When this sort of thing happens, your stomach drops and you feel like you've just destroyed a pharaoh's tomb.\" Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen  Briggs BBC Environment correspondent China - the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases - has announced details of its climate action plan. The office of Premier Li Keqiang said that emissions \"will peak by around 2030\" and China would work hard to achieve the target even earlier. The statement echoes China's declaration last November following a US-China summit. China's pledge comes ahead of talks late this year in Paris to seek a new global deal on climate change. The statement, released following a meeting in Paris between Li and French President Francois Hollande, said China aimed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% by 2030, from 2005 levels.  The carbon intensity target builds on a previous plan to cut carbon intensity by 40-45% by 2020.  China also aimed to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption to about 20% by 2030, the statement added. Beijing previously set a goal of getting around 15% of its energy from clean sources by 2020.  Analysis by the BBC's science editor, David Shukman This is a significant moment in international climate negotiations. For years China argued that it was too poor and underdeveloped to even consider accepting any obligations to curb its greenhouse gases.  Now we're witnessing the world's largest emitter playing by the UN's rules and promising even deeper cuts that those suggested some months back. For diplomats and ministers hoping to see a meaningful deal at the climate summit in Paris at the end of the year, this will be a welcome step.  The size of cuts, and the timescale, will of course be judged by many as too little and too late. But for anyone who endured the collapse of talks at the Copenhagen summit six years ago, China is playing a very different and far more constructive game. Will it actually make any difference to global warming?  Scientists always say it does not matter to the atmosphere where the emissions come from and China's will continue to rise for the next 15 years or so, and on their already gargantuan scale.  And today's announcement does not mean that Chinese use of fossil fuels is coming to an end any time soon. On the same day that China has announced this climate plan it also began construction of a massive pipeline that will bring it a lot of gas from Russia.    All countries involved in UN climate talks must submit national plans for cutting emissions ahead of the key Paris talks.  China joins several other countries, including the EU, US and Mexico, that have already committed their plans for tackling climate change, formally known by the UN as INDCs (intended nationally determined contribution). With China's announcement, the world's biggest polluters - China, the US and the EU - have now all detailed their climate plans ahead of the global climate conference. Commenting on the statement, Li Shuo, climate analyst for Greenpeace China, said for success in Paris, all players  - including China and the EU - needed to up their game.  \"Today's pledge must be seen as only the starting point for much more ambitious actions.  \"It does not fully reflect the significant energy transition that is already taking place in China.  \"Given the dramatic fall in coal consumption, robust renewable energy uptake, and the urgent need to address air pollution, we believe the country can go well beyond what it has proposed today.\" China's new climate plan sends a strong message to other countries to do more on climate ahead of this year's negotiations for a new global climate deal, said WWF. Samantha Smith, global climate leader at WWF, said China was the first major developing country emitter to set a total emissions peak target.  \"In doing so, China has committed to both global climate security and to a transformational energy transition at home,\" she said.  \"We emphasise the importance of the fact that China has made commitments beyond its responsibility as a developing country. But we hope that China will continue to find ways to reduce its emissions, which will in turn drive global markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.\"  On Monday, at talks in Brussels with EU leaders, the Chinese Premier said the country was seeking a fair, global system to tackle climate change. China will work with the international community to seek a \"fair, reasonable, win-win\" global climate governance system, Li said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic has driven the biggest annual fall in CO2 emissions since World War Two, say researchers.  Their  study  indicates that emissions have declined by around 7% this year.  France and the UK saw the greatest falls, mainly due to severe shutdowns in response to a second wave of infections.  China, by contrast, has seen such a large rebound from coronavirus that overall emissions may grow this year.  The decline in carbon in 2020 has dwarfed all the previous big falls.  According to the  Global Carbon Project  team, this year saw carbon emissions decline by 2.4 billion tonnes.  This video can not be played In contrast, the fall recorded in 2009 during the global economic recession was just half a billion tonnes, while the ending of World War Two saw emissions fall by under one billion tonnes.  Across Europe and the US, the drop was around 12% over the year, but some individual countries declined by more.  France saw a fall of 15% and the UK went down by 13%, according to one analysis.  \"The main reason is that these two countries had two waves of confinement that were really quite severe compared with other countries,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, UK, who contributed to the study. \"The UK and France have a lot of their emissions come from the transport sector and generally have a bit less coming from industry and other sectors. \"This is even more true in France, because so much of their electricity production is from nuclear energy, so 40% of their emissions are from the transport sector.\" Aviation around the world has been badly hit by restrictions and by the end of this year, it's expected that emissions from this sector will still be 40% below 2019 levels.  One country that may have bucked the trend is China.  Overall, the research team estimates that the country will experience a fall in emissions of 1.7% this year but some analysis suggests that the country has already rebounded enough from Covid-19 that the overall carbon output may have increased.  \"All our datasets show that China experienced a big drop in emissions in February and March, but the datasets differ in the level of emissions towards the end of 2020,\" said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at  CICERO , who was involved in the study.  \"In late 2020, China is at least close to having the same level of daily emissions as in 2019, and indeed some of our estimates suggest Chinese emissions may have actually increased for the year as a whole in 2020 relative to 2019, despite the pandemic,\" he added.  Researchers believe that dramatic drop experienced through the pandemic response might be hiding a longer term fall-off in carbon, more related to climate policies. The annual growth in global CO2 emissions fell from around 3% in the early years of this century to around 0.9% in the 2010s. Much of this change was down to a move away from coal as an energy source.  \"An emerging discussion pre-2020 was whether global fossil CO2 emissions were showing signs of peaking,\" said Glen Peters, research director at CICERO. \"Covid-19 has changed this narrative to one that involves avoiding a rebound in emissions and asking if emissions have already peaked,\" he said. All the researchers involved in this project agree that a rebound of emissions in 2021 is almost certain.  To minimise the uptick in carbon, the scientists are urging a \"green\" rather than a \"brown\" response, meaning recovery funding should be spent on sustainable projects and not on fossil fuels.  They argue that efforts should also be made to boost walking and cycling in cities and to rapidly deploy electric vehicles. While 2020's fall of over two billion tonnes of CO2 is welcome, the scientists say that meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will need cuts of up to two billion tonnes every year for the next decade.  \"Although global emissions were not as high as last year, they still amounted to about 39 billion tonnes of CO2, and inevitably led to a further increase in CO2 in the atmosphere,\" said lead researcher Prof Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter, UK. \"The atmospheric CO2 level, and consequently the world's climate, will only stabilise when global CO2 emissions are near zero.\" The study has been published  in the journal Earth System Science Data .

{"id":null,"body":"BBC News environment correspondent Richard Black traces key milestones, scientific discoveries, technical innovations and political action. 1712  - British ironmonger Thomas Newcomen invents the first widely used steam engine, paving the way for the Industrial Revolution and industrial scale use of coal. 1800  - World population reaches one billion. 1824  - French physicist Joseph Fourier describes the Earth's natural \"greenhouse effect\". He writes: \"The temperature [of the Earth] can be augmented by the interposition of the atmosphere, because heat in the state of light finds less resistance in penetrating the air, than in re-passing into the air when converted into non-luminous heat.\" 1861  - Irish physicist John Tyndall shows that water vapour and certain other gases create the greenhouse effect. \"This aqueous vapour is a blanket more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man,\" he concludes. More than a century later, he is honoured by having a prominent UK climate research organisation - the Tyndall Centre - named after him. 1886  - Karl Benz unveils the Motorwagen, often regarded as the first true automobile. 1896  - Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius concludes that industrial-age coal burning will enhance the natural greenhouse effect. He suggests this might be beneficial for future generations. His conclusions on the likely size of the \"man-made greenhouse\" are in the same ballpark - a few degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2 - as modern-day climate models. 1900  - Another Swede, Knut Angstrom, discovers that even at the tiny concentrations found in the atmosphere, CO2 strongly absorbs parts of the infrared spectrum. Although he does not realise the significance, Angstrom has shown that a trace gas can produce greenhouse warming. 1927  - Carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach one billion tonnes per year. 1930  - Human population reaches two billion. 1938  - Using records from 147 weather stations around the world, British engineer Guy Callendar shows that temperatures had risen over the previous century. He also shows that CO2 concentrations had increased over the same period, and suggests this caused the warming. The \"Callendar effect\" is widely dismissed by meteorologists. 1955  - Using a new generation of equipment including early computers, US researcher Gilbert Plass analyses in detail the infrared absorption of various gases. He concludes that doubling CO2 concentrations would increase temperatures by 3-4C. 1957  - US oceanographer Roger Revelle and chemist Hans Suess show that seawater will not absorb all the additional CO2 entering the atmosphere, as many had assumed. Revelle writes: \"Human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment...\" 1958  - Using equipment he had developed himself, Charles David (Dave) Keeling begins systematic measurements of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa in Hawaii and in Antarctica. Within four years, the project - which continues today - provides the first unequivocal proof that CO2 concentrations are rising. 1960  - Human population reaches three billion. 1965  - A US President's Advisory Committee panel warns that the greenhouse effect is a matter of \"real concern\". 1972  - First UN environment conference, in Stockholm. Climate change hardly registers on the agenda, which centres on issues such as chemical pollution, atomic bomb testing and whaling. The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) is formed as a result. 1975  - Human population reaches four billion. 1975  - US scientist Wallace Broecker puts the term \"global warming\" into the public domain in the title of a scientific paper. 1987  - Human population reaches five billion 1987  - Montreal Protocol agreed, restricting chemicals that damage the ozone layer. Although not established with climate change in mind, it has had a greater impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol. 1988  - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) formed to collate and assess evidence on climate change. 1989  - UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - possessor of a chemistry degree - warns in a speech to the UN that \"We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere... The result is that change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto.\" She calls for a global treaty on climate change. 1989  - Carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach six billion tonnes per year. 1990  - IPCC produces First Assessment Report. It concludes that temperatures have risen by 0.3-0.6C over the last century, that humanity's emissions are adding to the atmosphere's natural complement of greenhouse gases, and that the addition would be expected to result in warming. 1992  - At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, governments agree the United Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its key objective is \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". Developed countries agree to return their emissions to 1990 levels. 1995  - IPCC Second Assessment Report concludes that the balance of evidence suggests \"a discernible human influence\" on the Earth's climate. This has been called the first definitive statement that humans are responsible for climate change. 1997  - Kyoto Protocol agreed. Developed nations pledge to reduce emissions by an average of 5% by the period 2008-12, with wide variations on targets for individual countries. US Senate immediately declares it will not ratify the treaty. 1998  - Strong El Nino conditions combine with global warming to produce the warmest year on record. The average global temperature reached 0.52C above the mean for the period 1961-90 (a commonly used baseline). 1998  - Publication of the controversial \"hockey stick\" graph indicating that modern-day temperature rise in the northern hemisphere is unusual compared with the last 1,000 years. The work would later be the subject of two enquiries instigated by the US Congress. 1999  - Human population reaches six billion. 2001  - President George W Bush removes the US from the Kyoto process. 2001  - IPCC Third Assessment Report finds \"new and stronger evidence\" that humanity's emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause of the warming seen in the second half of the 20th Century. 2005  - The Kyoto Protocol becomes international law for those countries still inside it. 2005  - UK Prime Minister Tony Blair selects climate change as a priority for his terms as chair of the G8 and president of the EU. 2006  - The Stern Review concludes that climate change could damage global GDP by up to 20% if left unchecked - but curbing it would cost about 1% of global GDP. 2006  - Carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach eight billion tonnes per year. 2007  - The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report concludes it is more than 90% likely that humanity's emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for modern-day climate change. 2007  - The IPCC and former US vice-president Al Gore receive the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\". 2007  - At UN negotiations in Bali, governments agree the two-year \"Bali roadmap\" aimed at hammering out a new global treaty by the end of 2009. 2008  - Half a century after beginning observations at Mauna Loa, the Keeling project shows that CO2 concentrations have risen from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 380ppm in 2008. 2008  - Two months before taking office, incoming US president Barack Obama pledges to \"engage vigorously\" with the rest of the world on climate change. 2009  - China overtakes the US as the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter - although the US remains well ahead on a per-capita basis. 2009  - Computer hackers download a huge tranche of emails from a server at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit and release some on the internet, leading to the \"ClimateGate\" affair. 2009  - 192 governments convene for the UN climate summit in Copenhagen with expectations of a new global agreement high; but they leave only with a controversial political declaration, the Copenhagen Accord. 2010  - Developed countries begin contributing to a $30bn, three-year deal on \"Fast Start Finance\" to help them \"green\" their economies and adapt to climate impacts. 2010  - A series of reviews into \"ClimateGate\" and the IPCC ask for more openness, but clear scientists of malpractice. 2010  - The UN summit in Mexico does not collapse, as had been feared, but ends with agreements on a number of issues. 2011  - A new analysis of the Earth's temperature record by scientists concerned over the \"ClimateGate\" allegations proves the planet's land surface really has warmed over the last century. 2011  - Human population reaches seven billion. 2011  - Data shows concentrations of greenhouse gases are rising faster than in previous years. 2012  - Arctic sea ice reaches a minimum extent of 3.41 million sq km (1.32 million sq mi), a record for the lowest summer cover since satellite measurements began in 1979. 2013  - The Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii reports that the daily mean concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has surpassed 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time since measurements began in 1958. 2013  - The first part of the IPCC's fifth assessment report says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Wallace Broecker, the US climate scientist who helped popularise the term \"global warming\" has died in New York at the age of 87. Prof Broecker was among the first to connect emissions of CO2 to rising temperatures back in the 1970s. He also studied the ocean conveyor belt, linking oceanography to climate change.  Scientists the world over have paid tribute, calling Prof Broecker a \"genius and pioneer\". Widely known as Wally, Prof Broecker spent a career that spanned nearly 67 years at Columbia University in New York.  In 1975, he published a paper in the journal Science that had a profound effect on thinking about the connection between carbon dioxide and temperatures around the world.  It was titled  Climatic Change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?  The paper was said to be the first time the phrase was used in a research paper.  This video can not be played The study outlined the idea that humans were having a significant impact on the climate by emitting CO2.  He argued that the world in the 1970s was experiencing what he believed was a 40-year cooling cycle that would soon end and the signal of human induced warming would soon be evident.  Just a year later in 1976, temperatures started to go up and have gone up since along the lines that Wally Broecker predicted.  In the 1980s, he told US political leaders that the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warranted a \"bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere\". Prof Broecker's work on the ocean current conveyor was also hugely important.  What sad news. RIP Wally Broecker, and thanks for all you did to advance both the science and public understanding of climate change.  https:\/\/t.co\/htMmmj3rHE He outlined the idea that the scale of circulation of these currents must help regulate the climate system by moving large amounts of heat from one place to another. He also developed the idea that the conveyor could suddenly change, leading to dramatic climatic shifts that could occur over decades not millennia, as previously thought.  Prof Broecker was hugely concerned about the ability of humans to tackle the root causes of climate change. He became an early advocate for the idea of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere using machines.  \"I don't like the idea of a technological solution any more than anyone else does but I'm saying that unless we have a technological solution CO2 is going to keep on going up,\" he explained to the BBC in an interview back in 2009. \"We can put a tax on CO2, society has learned how to keep water clean, now we have to learn how to keep the atmosphere in a nearly natural state. \"We are not going to be able to do that because we are predestined, I think, to double CO2 in the atmosphere.\"  \"And that means a 3.5C warming if the models are right, it means precipitation will change almost everywhere on the planet, polar ice will melt and sea level is going to slowly rise and these things are going to change the world we live in.\"   Prof Broecker's high standing as a scientist was reflected in the many messages and tweets that have followed his passing.  Rest in Peace, Wally Broecker (1931-2019) A legend of climate science who gave us the term \"global warming\", helped us understand the ocean's role in climate change, discovered thermohaline circulation, and helped explain many biogeochemical cycles.   https:\/\/t.co\/HewFaYpRCQ   pic.twitter.com\/zuCZEA106z \"He has singlehandedly pushed more understanding than probably anybody in our field,\" said Richard Alley, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University.  \"He is intellectually so huge in how the Earth system works and what its history is, that all of us are following Wally in one way or other.\" Prof Broecker was known for his friendly, humble demeanour. He suffered from dyslexia, and never learned how to type or use a personal computer. He was somewhat embarrassed at the fuss over coining the term \"global warming\", which he put down to \"dumb luck\". In an  obituary on the Columbia University website , Prof Broecker is quoted as warning that he would turn over in his grave if someone put the phrase on his tombstone.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Katowice Climate change has significantly boosted the chances of having summer heatwaves in the UK. A Met Office study says that the record-breaking heat seen in 2018 was made about 30 times more likely because of emissions from human activity.  Without warming the odds of a UK heatwave in any given year were less than half a percent.  But a changing climate means this has risen to 12%, or about once every eight years.  The blazing summer of 2018 was the joint warmest for the UK, It tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910. The steep temperatures that sustained across most parts of the UK, peaked on July 27 when 35.6C was recorded at Felsham in Suffolk.  Now researchers have analysed the observed data using climate models that can simulate the world with or without the impact of fossil fuel emissions.  Announcing their findings at global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, UK Met Office researchers said that the impact of global warming on the hot summer were significant.  \"Climate change has made the heatwave we had this summer much more likely, about 30 times more likely than it would have been had we not changed our climate through our emissions of greenhouse gases,\" said Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office who carried out the analysis. \"If we look back over many centuries, we can see that the summer like 2018 was a very rare event before the industrial revolution when we started pumping out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\" \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that in a world without warming the chances of having a heatwave are around 0.4% every year. Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.  \"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying. A  previous analysis carried out earlier this year  by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher? \"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott. \"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\" \"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\" A number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Just yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers.  While some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development.  \"For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news\" he told BBC News.  \"It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.\"  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK must avoid lurching from the coronavirus crisis into a deeper climate crisis, the government\u2019s advisers have warned.  They recommend that ministers ensure funds earmarked for a post-Covid-19 economic recovery go to firms that will reduce carbon emissions. They say the public should work from home if possible; and to walk or cycle. And investment should prioritise broadband over road-building, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says.  People should also be encouraged to save emissions by continuing to consult GPs online. The government will reply later, although the Energy Secretary Alok Sharma has already spoken in favour of a green recovery to the recession. In a letter to the Prime Minister, the committee says jobless people should be re-trained for work in geographically-spread labour-intensive \u201cgreen\u201d industries such as home insulation; tree-planting; and peatland restoration. It makes a veiled reference to the current discussions over a potential government bailout to save jobs in aviation, which is struggling in the crisis.  The letter says: \u201cMany sectors of the UK economy do not currently bear the full costs of emitting greenhouse gases. Revenue could be raised by setting or raising carbon prices for these sectors.\u201d Green groups say any bailout should include a condition that the industry shrinks until it finds a technological solution to its carbon emissions. The letter also tackles broader social themes of fairness and risk. It says the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted inequalities, with poorer people more in danger.  The committee notes: \u201cThe response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people - who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change.  \u201cThe benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely, and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes.  \u201cIt is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new, resilient economy.\u201d  The committee says the government must produce policies that allow the UK to reduce emissions to Net Zero in an orderly way \u2013 unlike the chaos of the Covid-19 crisis. The CCC Chairman, Lord Deben, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of planning well for the risks the country faces.  \u201cRecovery means investing in new jobs, cleaner air and improved health. The actions needed to tackle climate change are central to rebuilding our economy.  \u201cThe government must prioritise actions that reduce climate risks and avoid measures that lock-in higher emissions.\u201d The message is not uncontested. Some politicians have argued that jobs must be protected at all cost in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession. The UK will chair a vital global climate conference next year. Lord Deben said the UK should set a global example by planning a climate-friendly recovery from Covid-19. The committee has copied the letter to the leaders of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. It will expand on its advice in June. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says the government should harness the lessons from the Covid-19 crisis to  create a better society overall. She says ministers should force firms to show how they will meet CO2 cuts, and give people a right to locally-produced food; affordable clean energy; and access to green space. The environment consultancy EPR says ministers should change the balance of the planning process to ensure that green space is a top priority rather than a nice-to-have. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The world's wealthiest 1% account for more than twice the combined carbon emissions of the poorest 50%, according to the UN. Their emissions gap report finds that the richest will need to rapidly cut their CO2 footprints to avoid dangerous warming this century. The study finds that the global Covid-19 shutdown will have little long term impact on the climate.  But a strong, green recovery could limit the rise in temperatures to 2C. The study, compiled by the UN Environment Programme (Unep), underlines the chasm between the level of emissions consistent with keeping temperatures down and what's happening in the real world.  It predicts that while carbon production will have tumbled by around 7% this year because of the pandemic, this would only reduce warming by 0.01C by 2050.  While the report looks at the plans that governments have submitted to curb their CO2, it also examines the roles of lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals.  The global top 10% of income earners use around 45% of all the energy consumed for land transport and around 75% of all the energy for aviation, compared with just 10% and 5% respectively for the poorest 50% of households, the report says. If the world wants to keep on track to restrict the rise in temperatures this century to 1.5C, then these high carbon footprints will need to be significantly curbed to around 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita by 2030.  For the poorest 50% of the world, that would actually mean an increase in their footprint by a factor of three.   And for the top 10% of earners, this would mean cuts to around one tenth of their current level. But for the richest 1%, it would mean a dramatic reduction. \"The wealthy bear the greatest responsibility in this area,\" Unep executive director Inger Anderson wrote in a foreword to the report.  \"The combined emissions of the richest 1% of the global population account for more than twice the combined emissions of the poorest 50%.\" \"This elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets,\" she wrote. The report shows the types of lifestyle changes that would make a difference.  Foregoing one long-haul international return flight could reduce your personal footprint by almost two tonnes of CO2. Switching to renewable electricity by households could curb carbon by around 1.5 tonnes per capita, while embracing a vegetarian diet would save around half a tonne of carbon on average.  \"The UNEP report shows that the over-consumption of a wealthy minority is fuelling the climate crisis, yet it is poor communities and young people who are paying the price,\" said Tim Gore, head of climate policy at Oxfam, and a contributing author to the report.  \"It will be practically and politically impossible to close the emissions gap if governments don't cut the carbon footprint of the wealthy and end the inequalities which leave millions of people without access to power or unable to heat their homes.\" As well as the lifestyle and consumption changes that individuals can make, the report also details the opportunities that exist for governments in pursuing a green recovery from Covid-19. If countries invest in climate action, this could reduce expected emissions in 2030 by around 25%, enough to give the world a 66% chance of holding temperatures below 2C. \"The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,\" said Inger Andersen. \"However, Unep's Emissions Gap report shows that a green pandemic recovery can take a huge slice out of greenhouse gas emissions and help slow climate change. I urge governments to back a green recovery in the next stage of Covid-19 fiscal interventions and raise significantly their climate ambitions in 2021.\" The Unep report says that so far, action by governments on a green recovery has been limited - but a growing number of countries are committing to net-zero emissions targets by the middle of the century. But to keep to the 2C goal, the level of ambition in the Paris agreement needs to be tripled. To keep under 1.5C, that ambition needs to increase five-fold. \"The life raft that we have is a green recovery,\" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.  \"Combining post-Covid economic investment to accelerate the change to a zero-carbon world gives us real hope that we can limit global heating to the all-important 1.5C temperature increase.  \"Warming above that will lead to increasingly severe impacts on the planet and its people and could kick start feedbacks in the climate system that could lead to runaway climate change.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The worst-case scenario for emissions of CO2 this century is no longer plausible, say researchers. Referred to as \"business as usual\", the scenario assumes a 500% increase in the use of coal, which is now considered unlikely. Climate models suggest that this level of carbon could see warming of up to 6C by 2100, with severe impacts. Researchers say that on current trends, a rise in temperatures of around 3C is far more likely. About 10 years ago, ahead of the fifth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), researchers developed four different scenarios to describe how carbon emissions might change over the rest of this century.  One of these clumsily titled \"Representative Concentration Pathways\" (RCPs), was called RCP8.5 and it was intended to show the impact of very high emissions consistent with a five fold increase in the use of coal and virtually no policies to limit CO2 emissions.  RCP8.5 was first developed by energy researchers to help with their modelling. According to the authors of this paper, they didn't do a good job of communicating the limitations of this approach to climate scientists who wanted to use it to see what would happen with temperatures.  Rather than being seen as something that only had a 3% chance of becoming reality, it became known as the \"business-as-usual\" scenario, by climate scientists and has been used in more than 2,000 research papers since. \"What we're arguing is that we've been misusing the worst climate change scenario,\" said author Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in California. \"Obviously, a lot has changed since 2005 or so when the scenario was created. A lot of clean technology prices have fallen, by factors of five, while global coal use peaked in 2013. And it's been flat since then.\"  \"So what originally was a sort of worst-case (scenario) with less than 10% chance of happening is today, exceedingly unlikely.\" This is more about scientific assumptions added to a communications cock-up. Very few scientists realised that RCP8.5 was originally a 90th percentile outcome, not a most likely or business-as-usual outcome. They assumed too much, when they should perhaps have checked, say the authors of the review. \"At the end of the day, scientists have to take responsibility for what they choose as input data, and there should be a degree of due diligence,\" said Glen Peters, from the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway. \"How many of your average climate scientists know the nuances of RCP8.5? It would certainly be interesting to know.\" The media, taking their steer from scientists, have tended to use the highest impacts when reporting on projections based on emissions scenarios.  \"That's not to say that these highest-end impacts are impossible to happen, but it is not business-as-usual. And that's the point we're really trying to make in this piece.\" Not necessarily. This new work questions the chances of very high future emissions because renewable energy is now much cheaper, and competing with coal.  So rather than a world that warms by 6C, it should mean that the world will warm by around 3C based on current policies that countries have signed up to.   However, the authors are at pains to point out that the lower temperatures aren't guaranteed.  That's because scientists are still uncertain as to how sensitive temperatures are to CO2. New models are being used for the next set of major projections due from the IPCC next year. Those models are said to show that temperatures are more sensitive to CO2 than previously thought.  There is also the question of climate feedbacks. Although emissions from human activities might level off over this century, warming could see more permafrost melt which will push more methane and CO2 into the air, putting upward pressure on temperatures.  \"I don't think we can rule out a world of four degrees or above, because of these uncertainties in climate sensitivity and the uncertainties in carbon cycle feedbacks,\" said Zeke Hausfather.   \"So even under a lower emission scenario, you could have higher sea level rise, higher warming impacts, if climate sensitivity ends up being on the high end.\"  \"If you think of climate as a problem of risk management, you don't necessarily just want to plan for the most likely outcome, You want to plan for sort of the tail risk, the relatively low probability but high impact scenario.\"  The authors point out that a 3C rise would be a global average and that many parts of the world such as the Arctic would likely warm by much more than that.  \"You having a world where the coral reefs are largely wiped out at three degrees warming, you're having a world where combined with deforestation, there's a real high risk of the Amazon rainforest turning into more of a savannah type ecosystem in the long run,\" said Zeke Hausfather.  Experts believe that at 3C, the Arctic sea-ice would be mostly gone in the summer with devastating consequences. It could cause large scale melting of permafrost, It could destabilise roads and houses in the far north and there's increasing damage to crop yields. \"There's a lot of real impacts with three degrees that we can't sweep away. And there's a non-trivial risk that climate sensitivity is four degrees instead of three.\" Many people have concerns that if strong action isn't taken to curb emissions, then the cumulative effect of all the impacts of climate change could threaten the future of humanity. \"There's never been that much evidence that climate change is going to literally cause the extinction of the human race,\" said Zeke Hausfather.  \"But there's a lot of things in the world that are less bad than literal extinction that we want to avoid at all costs.\"  Yes - it shows that even the limited attempts to cut carbon that the world has adopted to date are having an impact and the worst emissions scenarios are no longer realistic.  While a world that warms by 3C is a disaster, the progress that's been made should encourage people to aim for higher targets to try to keep the world to 1.5C of warming, which science suggests is a much safer threshold.  \"In many ways this is a success story. It's not where we want to get it's not meeting the Paris agreement targets of limiting warming to below 2C, but the world has taken some action and clean energy has gotten cheaper,\" said Zeke Hausfather.  \"And as that happens, we're necessarily going to move away from some of the worst case possible outcomes. The more climate policies countries enact, the more we're going to sort of head toward a world of two to three degrees warming, hopefully on the two side, and hopefully below two, but that requires a lot more political effort.\"  The  commentary has been published in the journal Nature .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Meeting the UK's world-leading climate change target will be a \"colossal challenge\", a government spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat. In a report  it says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater. The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Making the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December. The announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided. They urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets. The PM said: \u201cWe have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process \u2013 uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change. \u201cToday, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030 faster than any major economy. \u201cBut this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets.\u201d One of the UK\u2019s leading climate scientists, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, told BBC News: \u201cMr Johnson\u2019s target is ambitious \u2013 but we need action to back it up, right now.  He noted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently committed \u00a3127bn to the HS2 rail link and new roads - which will both increase emissions - while offering just \u00a31bn to home insulation, which would reduce emissions. Prof Hoskins remarked: \u201cThe actions of the chancellor don't measure up. Every single department has to wear climate change glasses when they think of new policies, and the Treasury clearly hasn\u2019t got that message.\u201d He and other scientists said even if the UK and other nations keep their promises on cutting emissions there was no guarantee the world would avoid serious heating. \u201cThe world will be increasingly difficult and dangerous with every percentage point of temperature rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are important things we don\u2019t know for sure. How much more does it take to destabilise Antarctica, for instance? We don't know\u2026 and the impact could be devastating.\u201d Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia said if nations matched the UK\u2019s lead \u201cit won\u2019t be a safe climate \u2013 but it will be a safer climate than we\u2019d get based on current levels of ambition.\u201d In 2019, total UK greenhouse gas emissions were 45% per cent lower than in 1990. Achieving the new target, a 68% cut, will require the UK working 50% harder than it currently is.  Between 2008 and 2018 the energy sector saw the biggest fall in emissions (-62%) as the UK abandoned coal burning. It's followed by the waste sector (-46%) which started capturing methane emissions, and industry (29%) where efficiency improved. Emissions from transport have barely fallen (-3%). Farm emissions are almost static (-2%). A coalition of green groups is urging the government to reach a 75% cut by 2030.  And more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion say the UK should stop emissions almost completely within a few years to be confident of avoiding climate disaster. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that it is economically feasible for UK emissions to be cut by 72%. The government has not costed the range of measures that would be needed, but experts say more homes will need to switch to low-carbon heating. Gas-guzzling SUVs might also be forced off the roads \u2013 and frequent fliers taxed more. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises government, welcomed the 68% cut, but warned: \u201cThis is more than just a number.  \u201cIt should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and net zero strategy to deliver against the UK goal; clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions; and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries.\u201d  Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. More policies will be revealed if the long-delayed Energy White Paper is published, as expected, before Christmas. The prime minister\u2019s 68% target represents the UK\u2019s NDC \u2013 its nationally determined contribution towards meeting the Paris Agreement.  This video can not be played NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris deal, signed in 2016, is aimed at keeping global temperature rise well under 2C, preferably with a maximum rise of 1.5C. The virtual event Mr Johnson is hosting next week is in place of annual UN climate talks scheduled for Glasgow in November but postponed by a year because of Covid-19. The UK will hold the presidency of next year\u2019s meeting in partnership with Italy. It is known as COP26 - the 26th Conference of the Parties.  Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris Agreement, said: \"This commitment from the prime minister can underpin his personal efforts to seek similar moves from counterparts in the run-up to the Glasgow Summit next year.  \u201c(It will need) investments in areas ranging from greener steel production to farming and clean heating technologies, but other countries can draw confidence from Britain's leadership.\" The RSPB\u2019s Martin Harper said: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s new 2030 climate target will enhance the UK\u2019s leadership credentials.   \u201cBut we need to go further and faster, in particular by investing in protecting and restoring habitats such as our peatlands which are so important for locking up carbon.\u201d  A UK strategy on conserving peat is long-delayed. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: \"We welcome the important strengthening of the 2030 UK target. But this is the minimum we should aim for.\" Peter Simpson, from Anglian Water and co-chair of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, said: \u201cCredible plans matter in the race to zero, so today\u2019s announcement is welcomed. The spotlight is on.\u201d  Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the net zero target was \"daunting\". \"The government hasn't put its own house in order yet or done enough to put the UK on course to meet older, easier targets. It's time to lead by example and shift its efforts up a gear,\" she said. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Countries will have to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five fold if the world is to avoid warming by more than 1.5C, the UN says. The annual emissions gap report shows that even if all current promises are met, the world will warm by more than double that amount by 2100. Richer countries have failed to cut emissions quickly enough, the authors say. Fifteen of the 20 wealthiest nations have no timeline for a net zero target. Hot on the heels of the World Meteorological Organization's report on greenhouse gas concentrations, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) has published its regular snapshot of how the world is doing in cutting levels of these pollutants.  The emissions gap report looks at the difference between how much carbon needs to be cut to avoid dangerous warming  - and where we are likely to end up with the promises that countries have currently committed to, in the Paris climate agreement. The UN assessment is fairly blunt. \"The summary findings are bleak,\" it says. \"Countries collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.\" The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5% per year in the last decade. In 2018, the total reached 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century. \r\n                                 2019 \r\n                             10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Just last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that allowing temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees this century would have hugely damaging effects for human, plant and animal life across the planet.  This report says that to keep this target alive, the world needs to cut emissions by 7.6% every year for the next 10 years. \"Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,\" said Inger Andersen, Unep's executive director.  The report pays particular attention to the actions of the richest countries. The group of the 20 wealthiest (G20) are responsible for 78% of all emissions. But so far, only the EU, the UK, Italy and France have committed to long-term net zero targets.  Seven G20 members need to take more action to achieve their current promises. These include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the US.  For example, Brazil's plans were recently revised, \"reflecting the recent trend towards increased deforestation\".  Three countries - India, Russia and Turkey - are all on track to over-achieve their plans by 15% but the authors of the report say this is because the targets they set themselves were too low in the first place.  For three others - Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia - the researchers are uncertain as to whether they are meeting their targets or not.  That leaves China, the EU and Mexico as three countries or regions that are set to meet their promises or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as they are called, with their current policies.  Without serious upgrades to most countries' plans, the UN says the 1.5C target will be missed by a significant amount. \"We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger NDCs to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies,\" says Inger Anderson.  \"We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,\" she added. \"If we don't do this, the 1.5C goal will be out of reach before 2030.\" The report outlines some specific actions for different countries in the G20.  So for Argentina it's recommended that they work harder to shift the public towards widespread use of public transport in big cities. China is urged to ban all new coal-fired power plants, something that recent research casts doubt on.  The biggest focus of action is the energy system. To get a sense of the massive scale of change that is needed, the study says the world will have to spend up to $3.8 trillion per year, every year between 2020 and 2050 to achieve the 1.5C target.  The impression that time is running short is reinforced by the report - and UN negotiators gearing up to meet in Madrid next week at COP25 are feeling the pressure to increase their ambitions on carbon. \"This is a new and stark reminder by the Unep that we cannot delay climate action any longer,\" said Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for the ecological transition. \"We need it at every level, by every national and subnational government, and by the rest of the economic and civil society actors. We urgently need to align with the Paris Agreement objectives and elevate climate ambition. \"It would be incomprehensible if countries who are committed to the United Nations system and multilateralism did not acknowledge that part of this commitment requires further climate action. Otherwise, there will only be more suffering, pain, and injustice.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its provisional assessment suggests this year will be one of the three hottest, just behind 2016 and 2019. The warmest six years in global records dating back to 1850 have now all occurred since 2015.  The most notable warmth was in the Siberian Arctic, where temperatures were 5C above average. To work out the annual rise in temperatures for their State of the Climate report, the WMO uses information from five different global datasets. They then compare modern readings to temperatures taken between 1850-1900. This baseline figure is sometimes referred to as pre-industrial levels.  With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is  set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but  with a margin of error of 0.1C. All five datasets currently have 2020 as the second warmest, behind 2016 and ahead of 2019, based on comparisons with similar periods in previous years.    However the expectation from scientists is that the temperature data from November and December will likely see enough cooling to push 2020 into third spot.   That's because a  La Ni\u00f1a weather event has developed  in the Pacific Ocean and this normally depresses temperatures.  Despite this, the WMO is certain that 2020 will remain one of the warmest three.  \"Record warm years have usually coincided with a strong El Ni\u00f1o event, as was the case in 2016,\" said Prof Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary General. \"We are now experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat.\" These relatively similar global temperature figure recorded over the past few years hide considerable differences at local level.  In 2020, Siberia saw temperatures around 5C above average, which culminated in a reading of  38C at Verkhoyansk on the 20th June , which is provisionally the highest known temperature recorded anywhere north of the Arctic Circle.  January to October was also the warmest such period on record in Europe. But some places were below average including parts of Canada, Brazil, India and Australia.  Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded.  The majority of the excess heat generated from warming gases in the atmosphere ends up in the oceans.   This is putting added strain on the seas, with around 80% of global waters experiencing at least one marine heatwave this year.  These events, similar to heatwaves on land, see prolonged exposure to high temperatures which can have devastating impacts on marine creatures and ecosystems.  A  long-running heatwave  off the coast of California, known as \"the blob\", was said to have killed up to a million seabirds in 2015-16. Researchers say that these events have become more than 20 times more frequent over the past 40 years. \"About 90% of the heat accumulating within the climate system from anthropogenic climate change is stored in the ocean,\" said Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. \"This latest update from WMO clearly shows the oceans are continuing to warm, and at an accelerating rate, contributing to sea-level rise. This means climate change has significant momentum committing us to further change over the coming decades.\" The WMO says that warming continues to drive melting in many parts of the world, including Greenland where around 152 billion tonnes of ice was lost from the ice sheet in the year to August 2020. There were 30 named storms during the North Atlantic hurricane season, breaking the record for the number of such events.  As well as record numbers,  new evidence suggested  that hurricanes get stronger when they hit land because of rising temperatures.  Other impacts noted by the WMO this year included wildfires in Siberia, Australia and along the US West Coast and South America, which saw plumes of smoke circumnavigate the globe. Floods in Africa and South East Asia displaced large numbers of people and undermined food security for millions. The findings of the WMO report won't come as a surprise to most observers.  This video can not be played \"The state of the global climate? Parlous,\" said Prof Dave Reay from University of Edinburgh, UK. \"These annual updates of deteriorating planetary health always make for bleak reading; this year's is a full red alert. Surging heat, intensifying droughts and rampant wildfires all speak of the acute impacts of climate change in 2020.  They also warn of the chronic undermining of global carbon sinks - the oceans, trees and soils around the world - that is underway.  \"Throw yet more emissions and warming at them and they will rip the Paris climate goals from our grasp forever. The year ahead will be defined by our recovery from Covid-19, the centuries ahead will be defined by how green that recovery actually is.\" Environmental campaigners say the report adds urgency to calls for the recovery, post-Covid, to focus on climate change and the environment. \"Although the pandemic will have been the biggest concern to many people in the developed world in 2020, for millions in climate vulnerable places the climate emergency remains the biggest threat and sadly there is no simple vaccine to fix the climate. But keeping fossil fuels in the ground would be a good start,\" said Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. \"These findings show just how important it is to ensure the government's economic recovery measures don't entrench the fossil fuel economy but act to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon world.\" According to a new report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), climate change is now the biggest threat to the most important world heritage sites.  The IUCN says that 83 such sites are now threatened by rising temperatures, including the Great Barrier Reef where ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather have all contributed to a dramatic decline.  It has been rated as having a \"critical\" outlook for the first time.  Follow Matt  on Twitter. .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent If the Glasgow climate conference fails to deliver, it could mark the end of the global approach to tackling the problem. COP26 in November will see around 200 world leaders meet to agree a new, long term deal on rising temperatures.  But according to Claire O'Neill, the president of COP26, the UK has \"one shot\" at making it a success. She told a  BBC documentary  that if Glasgow fails, people will question the whole UN approach. COP26 marks a critical moment for the UN in the long running effort to find a global solution to climate change.  As part of the Paris climate deal, agreed in 2015, countries are meant to update their carbon cutting plans by the end of this year.  So far, 114 say they have done this, or are in the process of doing so this year.  Another 120 countries have now told the UN that they have either agreed on plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or are working towards that goal. While this represents some progress, a key part of the Glasgow meeting will be trying to push countries to go even further.   In December, there was widespread dismay after countries failed to agree on more ambitious steps at the  Madrid conference of the parties known as COP25 . The messy compromise in the Spanish capital has also left a raft of complex issues unresolved, including the use of carbon markets, plus the question of compensation for loss and damage suffered by poorer nations from storms and rising sea levels.  Underpinning the lack of progress in Madrid was the huge gap between big emitters such as Brazil, Australia, India, China and US and an alliance of countries wanting to go much faster including the European Union, small island states and vulnerable nations.  Former UK minister Claire O'Neill has been tasked with presiding over COP26 and delivering an agreement acceptable to all.  Widely seen as knowledgeable and authoritative, Ms O'Neill says that Glasgow is the best, and perhaps last chance to make progress under the long drawn out UN process.  \"I think we have one shot,\" she said, speaking to the BBC at the end of the Madrid conference in December. \"I think if we don't have a successful outcome next year people will legitimately look at us and say 'what are you doing, is there a better way?' \"I think we have this amazing opportunity to get the world together to talk about ambition but crucially to deliver it, and I guess I am really determined to do that.\" Scientists say that to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century, a major upgrade is needed on the plans that countries are already applying to the problem.  Delivering anything close to that type of deal in Glasgow will depend on a number of key meetings in the run up to COP26. One of the most important is the summit between the President of China, Xi Jinping and EU leaders in Leipzig in September.   If the EU can persuade China to put an ambitious new climate plan on the table, it will significantly improve the chances of success in Glasgow.   \"For China to enhance it's climate targets or not will be primarily a political and diplomatic decision, and that is precisely why the European engagement at the diplomatic level will be critical for us to unlock further climate ambition from Beijing,\" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace China.  \"But the EU will have to have its own climate plan enhanced before the EU-China summit, and I think that's the only way to make that summit meaningful. \"The good news is that the Chinese president is coming and that provides a high level opportunity.\" However, many experts are concerned that China won't show its hand until they know who will be the next president of the United States - that election will take place just six days before the meeting in Glasgow opens. To achieve a deal, the UK will need to persuade some of the more reluctant countries like India, Brazil and Australia that it is in their interest to agree to increase their ambitions.  Rachel Kyte is now Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, but was previously the World Bank's special envoy on climate change.  She believes that agreement in Glasgow will need the UK to help shift the narrative - that a new climate deal offers more opportunities for countries than challenges.  \"This is completely within our means. Most of the technology we need, we have. Most of the finance we have, it's just sloshing around in the economy just really inefficiently purposed at the moment,\" she said. \"Governments and leaders need to understand they will be rewarded for being on the right side of history and for taking the risk, and it is one worth taking. \"It's an exciting future, it's cleaner, the air will be better - we'll have better jobs, it is not a sacrifice, it is something we owe ourselves.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The tiny oil- and gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar has been cut off by some of its powerful Arab neighbours over its alleged support for terrorism. Qatar refused to comply with an initial list of 13 demands, saying it would not agree to any measures that threatened its sovereignty or violated international law. The emirate has now been told by its neighbours that they want it to accept six broad principles on combating extremism and terrorism. Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to its neighbours but there are two key issues which have angered them in recent years. One is Qatar's support for Islamist groups. Qatar acknowledges that it has provided assistance to some, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, but denies aiding militant groups linked to al-Qaeda or so-called Islamic State (IS).  The other key issue is Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The Shia Muslim power is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. The deep diplomatic tensions behind the Qatar row All you need to know about Qatar Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar on 5 June. They also gave Qatari citizens 14 days to leave their territory and banned their own citizens from travelling to or residing in Qatar.  Egypt also cut diplomatic ties but did not impose restrictions on its 180,000 citizens living in Qatar.  Yemen, the Maldives and Libya's eastern-based government later followed suit.  In addition, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt closed their airspace to Qatari aircraft, and said foreign airlines would have to seek permission for overflights to and from Qatar. Qatar's only land border was also closed by Saudi Arabia and ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports. Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait has offered to mediate in the dispute. Qatar row threatens food and flights Qatar travel: What does it mean for me? Qatar is dependent on imports by land and sea for the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million, and about 40% of its food came in through the land border with Saudi Arabia. Initially, supermarket shelves in Doha were emptied of basic supplies as residents rushed to stock up but the hoarding quickly ended after Turkey and Iran began sending food by air and sea. This video can not be played Doha's Hamad International Airport has been far quieter than usual. Qatar Airways, the national carrier, has had to cancel flights to 18 regional cities and to reroute those to other destinations because of the airspace restrictions. Qatar's stock market lost about 10%, or about $15bn (\u00a312bn), in market value over the first four weeks of the crisis. However, the stock market has since recovered 6% of its pre-crisis value. Exports of liquefied natural gas have also so far not been affected and the emirate's finance minister says Qatar has enough resources to defend its economy and currency. Companies working on new stadiums and infrastructure projects for the 2022 football World Cup have meanwhile had to secure new sources for building materials. Shipping costs have gone up tenfold but Qatar has begun shipping cargo through Oman to get around the restrictions on access to ports in the UAE. Qatar 'facing indefinite isolation' Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? Qatar's neighbours said on 5 July they had received a \"negative response\" to the  13-point list  of demands presented to Qatar on 22 June. In return for ending the restrictions, they had told the emirate to: On 18 July, diplomats from the four nations said they were no longer insisting Qatar comply with the demands and instead wanted it to commit to six broad \"principles\".  They were combating terrorism and extremism, denying financing and safe havens to terrorist groups, stopping incitement to hatred and violence, and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,  the New York Times reported . After the deadline, what next? Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said on 5 July that its neighbours were \"demanding that we have to surrender our sovereignty\". That was something it would \"never do\", he stressed. \"Qatar continues to call for dialogue, despite the violation of international laws and regulations, despite the separation of 12,000 families, despite the siege that is a clear aggression and an insult to all international treaties, bodies and jurisdictions,\" Sheikh Mohammed added. Qatar FM: 'There is no evidence' Qatar has provided assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood and the Hamas movement. And while Qatar is a member of the US-led coalition against IS, it has faced accusations from Iraqi Shia leaders that it provided financial support to jihadists. Qatar - and Saudi Arabia for that matter - has also provided money and weapons to hardline Islamist rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria. But it has stressed that it does not have links to the al-Qaeda-linked alliance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.  Qatar's neighbours also seized on a  report  alleging it had paid a ransom of $1bn (\u00a3770m) to Iraqi Shia militias, Iranian security officials and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as part of a deal to secure the release of royal family members kidnapped in Iraq.  On 18 July, NBC News  cited  US intelligence officials as saying that \u20ac300m ($345m; \u00a3265m) had instead been paid to the Iraqi government, which had been in contact with the hostage-takers and subsequently confiscated the cash. Qatar said the money \"was to support the authorities\" in Iraq for the release of \"abductees\". Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims Qatar Gulf row threatens cash crisis for Gaza The US might be expected to want the crisis to end quickly because Qatar hosts the largest American military facility in the Middle East - al-Udeid airbase. President Donald Trump was nevertheless quick to claim credit for the pressure being placed on the emirate, saying it might mark the \"beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\". But his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, subsequently questioned the list of demands, acknowledging that some elements would \"be very difficult for Qatar to meet\".  Mr Tillerson has been conducting shuttle diplomacy in the region and on 11 July signed a  memorandum of understanding  with Qatar on terrorism financing.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The global response to the Covid-19 crisis has had little impact on the continued rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This year carbon emissions have fallen dramatically due to lockdowns that have cut transport and industry severely.  But this has only marginally slowed the overall rise in concentrations, the scientists say. The details are published in the WMO's  annual greenhouse gas bulletin .  This highlights the concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere.  Greenhouse gas concentrations are the cumulative result of past and present emissions of a range of substances, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.  Through the Paris Agreement, countries are trying to reduce emissions of these pollutants which are generated through, for example, the burning of fossil fuels. These greenhouse gases trap heat close to the Earth's surface, driving up temperatures. This planetary warming threatens global food supplies, makes weather events - such as tropical storms and heatwaves - more extreme and increases the risk of flooding caused by sea level rise. CO2 levels are measured in parts per million (ppm) - an indication of their overall atmospheric abundance. According to the WMO, the global average in 2019 was 410.5ppm, an increase of 2.6ppm over 2018. This was larger than the increase from 2017 to 2018 and bigger than the average over the past decade. Thanks to lockdowns in early 2020,  carbon emissions fell by 17% at their peak , but the overall effect on concentrations has been very small. Preliminary estimates suggest that CO2 will continue to increase this year but that rise will be reduced by 0.08 to 0.23ppm.  This falls within the 1ppm natural variability that occurs from year to year.  \"We breached the global threshold of 400 parts per million in 2015, and just four years later, we crossed 410 ppm, such a rate of increase has never been seen in the history of our records,\" said WMO secretary general, Prof Petteri Taalas. \"The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph. We need a sustained flattening of the curve,\" he said. While there isn't an overall figure for 2020 concentrations, individual monitoring stations show that the rise has continued this year despite the pandemic.  This video can not be played Monthly average CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa in Hawaii - a key atmospheric monitoring station, where carbon dioxide data is gathered - were 411.29ppm in September 2020, up from 408.54 the previous year. Similarly, at Cape Grim in Tasmania, another key air pollution measurement station, September 2020 saw CO2 concentrations reach 410.8ppm - up from 408.58 in 2019. While there are no details of methane levels for 2020, concentrations of that gas also went up in 2019. Methane concentrations increased by more than the average over the past decade, although the increase was slightly lower than in previous years. More than half of the methane emitted comes from human activities such as raising cattle, growing rice and drilling for oil and gas.  Concentrations of nitrous oxide grew by about the average of the past decade. Emissions come from agriculture, energy and waste management. This gas damages the ozone layer as well as contributing to global warming.  While the Covid-19 pandemic hasn't slowed down the increase in concentrations of all these warming gases in the atmosphere, the decline in emissions in the early part of this year shows what's possible.  \"The Covid-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change,\" said Prof Taalas.  \"However, it does provide us with a platform for more sustained and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net zero [balancing out any emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere] through a complete transformation of our industrial, energy and transport systems.   \"The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally.\" Meteorologists expect CO2 levels to vary by 1ppm between years due to natural fluctuations in the climate - for reasons other than human releases of carbon.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Claims by oil and gas companies that they are curbing their carbon emissions in line with net zero targets are overstated, according to a new review.  The independent analysis of six large European corporations acknowledges they have taken big steps on CO2 recently. In April, Shell became the latest to announce ambitious plans to be at net zero for operational emissions by 2050. But the authors say none of the companies are yet aligned with the 1.5C temperature goal.   Scientists argue that the global temperature must not rise by more than 1.5C by the end of the century if  the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The research has been carried out by the  Transition Pathway Initiative  (TPI), an investor-led group which investigates how companies are preparing for the move to a low-carbon economy.  Going\u202fnet zero\u202fmeans removing as many emissions as are produced. TPI found that the relationship between the oil and gas industry and climate change has evolved rapidly over the last three years.  In Europe, in 2017, no European company had set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplied.  Today, all six companies assessed by the analysis have targets and plans.  Over the last six months, say the authors of the report, climate ambitions among these companies have risen markedly.  In February,  the new head of BP, Bernard Looney , committed to cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 or sooner.  Going further than his predecessor, Mr Looney said BP would cut the emissions intensity of its sold products by 50% by the middle of this century.  But according to this new analysis, BP and Austrian company OMV are the only two oil and gas companies of the six assessed who have failed to align with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement. \"Is it sufficient? No, it's not,\" said Adam Matthews, co-chair of TPI. \"There are ones that have more comprehensive commitments that put them on a path much closer to two degrees than some of the others.\" Shell is classed as the most ambitious of the companies assessed and are the closest to a 2C warming scenario. However, despite Shell's  stated commitment  to having a net-zero energy business by 2050, TPI says that \"the claim that it will be aligned with a 1.5C climate scenario is not consistent with our analysis.\" The authors say that they have not been able to assess Shell's plan to sell only its energy products to companies that are committed to net zero. \"We can't yet quantify that,\" said Adam Matthews. \"But that potentially is very significant. And does get them to a sort of one and a half degree of warming kind of commitment, which is equivalent to net zero.\" According to the authors, a genuine net zero strategy for the average European oil and gas company would require 100% emissions cuts between now and 2050.  TPI point out that all of the plans they have assessed are, to some degree, dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and nature-based solutions such as planting trees.  \"There are very significant assumptions that need further probing,\" said Adam Matthews. \"And we obviously need greater understanding of the role that that these will play in delivering these strategies.\" Four of the companies assessed, Shell, Eni, Total and Repsol, are now aligned with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.   However, the authors draw a sharp contrast between the actions of these European companies and oil and gas producers in the US. None of the dozens of American fossil fuel corporations have public disclosures on climate change comparable to Europe, which TPI says is a concern.  \"We simply don't know what their intentions are on this issue, that poses a greater financial risk to us,\" said Adam Matthews.  \"We're continuing to engage, but engagements are finite, there comes a point at which you have to draw very clear conclusions.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent This video can not be played Greta Thunberg says the world needs to learn the lessons of coronavirus and treat climate change with similar urgency. That means the world acting \"with necessary force\", the Swedish climate activist says in an exclusive interview with BBC News. She doesn't think any \"green recovery plan\" will solve the crisis alone. And she says the world is now passing a \"social tipping point\" on climate and issues such as Black Lives Matter. \"People are starting to realise that we cannot keep looking away from these things\", says Ms Thunberg, \"we cannot keep sweeping these injustices under the carpet\". She says lockdown has given her time to relax and reflect away from the public gaze.  Ms Thunberg has shared with the BBC the text of a deeply personal programme she has made for Swedish Radio. In the radio programme, which goes online this morning, Greta looks back on the year in which she  became one of the world's most high-profile celebrities.  The then 16-year-old took a sabbatical from school to spend a tumultuous year campaigning on the climate.  She sailed across the Atlantic on a racing yacht to address a special UN Climate Action summit in New York in September. She describes world leaders queuing to get pictures with her, with Angela Merkel asking whether it was okay to post her photo on social media.  The climate campaigner is sceptical of their motives. \"Perhaps it makes them forget the shame of their generation letting all future generations down\", she says. \"I guess maybe it helps them to sleep at night.\" It was in the UN that she delivered her famous \"how dare you\" speech. \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words\", she told the world leaders gathered in the UN Assembly.  She appeared on the verge of tears as she continued. \"People are dying,\" she said, \"and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\" She knew it was a \"lifetime moment\" and decided not to hold anything back, she says now. \"I am going to let my emotions take control and to really make something big out of this because I won't be able to do this again\". She describes travelling back from the UN to her hotel on the subway and seeing people watching the speech on their phones, but says she felt no urge to celebrate. \"All that is left are empty words\", she says. The phrase reflects her deep cynicism about the motives of most world leaders.  \"The level of knowledge and understanding even among people in power is very, very low, much lower than you would think,\" she told the BBC. This video can not be played She says the only way to reduce emissions on the scale that is necessary is to make fundamental changes to our lifestyles, starting in developed countries. But she doesn't believe any leaders have the nerve to do that. Instead, she says, they \"simply refrain from reporting the emissions, or move them somewhere else\". She claims the UK, Sweden and other countries do this by failing to account for the emissions from ships and aircraft and by choosing not to count the emissions from goods produced in factories abroad. As a result, she says in her radio programme, the whole language of debate has been degraded. \"Words like green, sustainable, 'net-zero', 'environmentally friendly', 'organic', 'climate-neutral' and 'fossil-free' are today so misused and watered down that they have pretty much lost all their meaning. They can imply everything from deforestation to aviation, meat and car industries,\" she said. Ms Thunberg says the only positive that could come out of the coronavirus pandemic would be if it changes how we deal with global crises: \"It shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force.\" She says she is encouraged that politicians are now stressing the importance of listening to scientists and experts.  \"Suddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life.\" She hopes that will open up a discussion about the urgency of taking action to help the people who die from illnesses related to climate change and environmental degradation right now as well as in the future. But she remains deeply pessimistic about our ability to keep any temperature increases within safe boundaries. She says that, even if countries actually deliver the carbon reductions they've promised, we'll still be heading for a \"catastrophic\" global temperature rise of 3-4 degrees. The teenager believes the only way to avoid a climate crisis is to tear up contracts and abandon existing deals and agreements that companies and countries have signed up to. \"The climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today's political and economic systems\", the Swedish climate activist argues. \"That isn't an opinion. That's a fact.\" Thunberg talks movingly of a road-trip she and her father took through North America in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Hollywood actor turned politician and climate campaigner. She visited the charred remains of Paradise, the Californian town destroyed by a wildfire in November 2018.   She is shocked by the carbon-intensive lifestyles she saw in the US.  \"Apart from a few wind power plants and solar panels,\" she says, \"there are no signs whatsoever of any sustainable transition, despite this being the richest country in the world.\" But the social inequities struck her just as forcefully.  She describes meeting poor black, Hispanic and indigenous communities. \"It was very shocking to hear people talk about that they can't afford to put food on the table\", she explained. Yet Greta Thunberg says she has been inspired by the way people have been responding to these injustices, particularly the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in May. She believes society has \"passed a social tipping point, we can no longer look away from what our society has been ignoring for so long whether it is equality, justice or sustainability\". She describes signs of what she calls an \"awakening\" in which \"people are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact\". That is why Greta Thunberg says she still has hope. \"Humanity has not yet failed\", she argues. She concludes her radio documentary in powerful form. \"Nature does not bargain and you cannot compromise with the laws of physics,\" the teenager asserts. \"Doing our best is no longer good enough. We must now do the seemingly impossible. And that is up to you and me. Because no one else will do it for us.\" A longer version of  Justin Rowlatt's interview with Greta Thunberg  will be available next week.

{"id":null,"body":"By Lindsay Brown Newsbeat reporter A national climate emergency  has been declared by the UK Parliament. MPs are calling on the government to make changes that include setting a new target of reaching net zero emissions before 2050. The current target is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. In Scotland, a climate change emergency had  already been declared  - and targets are being set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  to net-zero by 2045 . Dozens of local areas around the UK have also said there is a climate emergency - but what does the term mean? There's no single definition, but many areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. The United Nations says we could have  just 11 years left  to limit a climate change catastrophe.  Bristol councillor Carla Denyer first put forward the idea of a local area declaring a climate emergency and in November  the city council passed the motion . \"We are acknowledging we are in an emergency situation,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat - speaking before the UK and Scottish governments made their pledges. She says it's not just about reducing carbon emissions on a local scale, but also raising awareness about climate change and trying to convince MPs so that changes can be made. \"The national government needs to declare an emergency and put resources in place to enable councils to help reduce carbon emissions. \"It's the first step to radical action.\" Do you have a question you want to ask about the planet? Try our climate change chatbot. If you can't see the chatbot above  tap on this link . In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had already declared a climate emergency at the SNP conference in April. She said she was inspired after meeting young climate campaigners who had gone on strike from school Dozens of local areas have copied Carla's motion and declared climate emergencies including Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Bath. Smaller parish and town councils have also asserted their own declarations to put pressure on government. The small market town of Machynlleth in west Wales  declared a climate emergency in January .  The town is looking at things like improving the energy efficiency of buildings and creating an electric car club to help it become carbon-zero by 2030.  This video can not be played Thousands of students from across the UK and around the world have walked out of lessons to protest about climate change. One of  their key demands , according to the UK Student Climate Network, is that they want the government to declare a climate emergency. They also want the national curriculum reformed to include \"the ecological crisis as an educational priority\". This video can not be played And Extinction Rebellion -  the group who held recent protests in UK cities  including London, Manchester and Newcastle - also wants a new legally binding target set for the UK to reduce its carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. Sam Appleton, 21, has put his degree on hold at Oxford University to become a climate change activist. He's told Newsbeat he thinks the most effective thing to make governments change their policies is activism.  \"I've come to the conclusion that this has to work this year if we are to avoid any future crises - we've only got 12 years.   \"In my eyes, climate change should be treated like there's a war going on and it should be the only thing people and MPs are talking about, not Brexit.\" He says although small lifestyle changes like swapping car journeys for cycling are important - changes in policy are more important. What does the government say? In the Spring Statement,  the Chancellor announced gas heating for new houses will be banned by 2025,  as part of plans to address the concerns of those protesting about climate change. While that move was welcomed by environmental campaigners, many said the government hadn't gone far enough.  Chancellor wants travel providers to offer carbon offsets... while he builds new runways.  Instead of finding increasingly elaborate ways to mop up climate-wrecking emissions, he must cut them at source with frequent flyer levy & investment in clean transport   #SpringStatement In a statement to Newsbeat in March, the government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \"Climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges we face today, and the UK is a world leader in tackling this problem.  Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger \"We were the first country to introduce long-term legally binding climate targets under the trailblazing Climate Change Act, which has helped the country cut greenhouse gas emissions by over 40% since 1990 and encouraged other nations to follow our lead. \"We want to continue to lead the world, which is why we've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target.\" Follow Newsbeat on  Instagram ,  Facebook ,  Twitter  and  YouTube .

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent Countries only have only a limited time in which to act if the world is to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Here are five reasons why 2021 could be a crucial year in the fight against global warming. Covid-19 was the big issue of 2020, there is no question about that.  But I'm hoping that, by the end of 2021, the vaccines will have kicked in and we'll be talking more about climate than the coronavirus. 2021 will certainly be a crunch year for tackling climate change.  Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told me he thinks it is a \"make or break\" moment for the issue. So, in the spirit of New Year's optimism, here's why I believe 2021 could confound the doomsters and see a breakthrough in global ambition on climate. In November 2021, world leaders will be gathering in Glasgow for the successor to the landmark Paris meeting of 2015. Paris was important because it was the first time virtually all the nations of the world came together to agree they all needed to help tackle the issue. The problem was the commitments countries made to cutting carbon emissions back then fell way short of the targets set by the conference. In Paris, the world agreed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change by trying to limit global temperature increases to 2C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The aim was to keep the rise to 1.5C if at all possible. We are way off track. On current plans the world is expected to breach the 1.5C ceiling within 12 years or less and to hit 3C of warming by the end of the century. Under the terms of the Paris deal, countries promised to come back every five years and raise their carbon-cutting ambitions.  That was due to happen in Glasgow in November 2020.  The pandemic put paid to that and the conference was bumped forward to this year.  So, Glasgow 2021 gives us a forum at which those carbon cuts can be ratcheted up. And there has already been progress.  The most important announcement on climate change last year came completely out of the blue. At the UN General Assembly in September, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, announced that China aimed to go carbon neutral by 2060. Environmentalists were stunned. Cutting carbon has always been seen as an expensive chore yet here was the most polluting nation on earth - responsible for some 28% of world emissions - making an unconditional commitment to do just that regardless of whether other countries followed its lead. That was a complete turnaround from past negotiations, when everyone's fear was that they might end up incurring the cost of decarbonising their own economy, while others did nothing but still enjoyed the climate change fruits of their labour. And China is not alone.  The UK was the first major economy in the world to make a legally binding net zero commitment in June 2019.  The European Union followed suit in March 2020.  Since then, Japan and South Korea have joined what the UN estimates is now a total of over 110 countries that have set net zero target for mid-century.  Together, they represent  more than 65% of global emissions and more than 70% of the world economy , the UN says.   With the election of Joe Biden in the United States, the biggest economy in the world has now re-joined the carbon cutting chorus. These countries now need to detail how they plan to achieve their lofty new aspirations - that will be a key part of the agenda for Glasgow - but the fact that they are already saying they want to get there is a very significant change. There is a good reason why so many countries are now saying they plan to go net zero:  the collapsing cost of renewables is completely changing the calculus of decarbonisation.  In October 2020, the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation, concluded that the best solar power schemes now offer \"the cheapest source of electricity in history\". Renewables are already often cheaper than fossil fuel power in much of the world when it comes to building new power stations.  And, if the nations of the world ramp up their investments in wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, prices are likely to fall even further to a point where they are so cheap it will begin to make commercial sense to shut down and replace existing coal and gas power stations. That is because the cost of renewables follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. It's like pushing on an open door - the more you build the cheaper it gets and the cheaper it gets the more you build. Think what this means: investors won't need to be bullied by green activists into doing the right thing, they will just follow the money.  And governments know that by scaling up renewables in their own economies, they help to accelerate the energy transition globally, by making renewables even cheaper and more competitive everywhere. The coronavirus pandemic has shaken our sense of invulnerability and reminded us that it is possible for our world to be upended in ways we cannot control. It has also delivered the most significant economic shock since the Great Depression. In response, governments are stepping forward with stimulus packages designed to reboot their economies. And the good news is it has rarely - if ever - been cheaper for governments to make these kind of investments. Around the world, interest rates are hovering around zero, or even negative. This creates an unprecedented opportunity to - in the now familiar phrase - \"build back better\".  The European Union and Joe Biden's new administration in the US have promised trillions of dollars of green investments to get their economies going and kick-start the process of decarbonisation.  Both are saying they hope other countries will join them - helping drive down the cost of renewables globally. But they are also warning that alongside this carrot, they plan to wield a stick - a tax on imports of countries that emit too much carbon. The idea is this may help induce carbon-cutting laggards - like Brazil, Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia - to come onside too. The bad news is that, according to the UN, developed nations are spending 50% more on sectors linked to fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy. The falling cost of renewable and the growing public pressure for action on climate is also transforming attitudes in business.  There are sound financial reasons for this.  Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20-30-year life? Indeed, why carry carbon risk in their portfolios at all? The logic is already playing out in the markets.  This year alone, Tesla's rocketing share price has made it the world's most valuable car company. Meanwhile, the share price of Exxon - once the world's most valuable company of any kind - fell so far that it got booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major US corporations. At the same time there is growing momentum behind the movement to get businesses to embed climate risk into their financial decision making.  The aim is to make it mandatory for businesses and investors to show that their activities and investments are making the necessary steps to transition to a net zero world. Seventy central banks are already working to make this happen, and building these requirements into the world's financial architecture will be a key focus for the Glasgow conference. It is still all to play for. So, there is good reason for hope but it is far from a done deal. To stand a reasonable chance of hitting the 1.5C target we need to halve total emissions by the end of 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN-backed body that collates the science needed to inform policy. What that means is making the sort of emissions reductions achieved in 2020 thanks to the massive international lockdowns every year to the end of the decade.  Yet emissions are already edging back to the levels they were in 2019. The truth is lots of countries have expressed lofty ambitions for cutting carbon but few have yet got strategies in place to meet those goals. The challenge for Glasgow will be getting the nations of the world to sign up to policies that will start reducing emissions now.  The UN says it wants to see coal phased out completely, an end to all fossil fuel subsidies and a global coalition to reach net zero by 2050. That remains a very tall order, even if global sentiments on tackling global warming are beginning to change. Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The world continued to pay a very high price for extreme weather in 2020, according to a report from the charity Christian Aid.  Against a backdrop of climate change, its  study  lists 10 events that saw thousands of lives lost and major insurance costs. Six of the events took place in Asia, with floods in China and India causing damages of more than $40bn. In the US, record hurricanes and wildfires caused some $60bn in losses. While the world has been struggling to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic, millions of people have also had to cope with the impacts of extreme weather events.  Christian Aid's list of ten storms, floods and fires all cost at least $1.5bn - with nine of the 10 costing at least $5bn. An  unusually rainy monsoon season  was associated with some of the most damaging storms in Asia, where some of the biggest losses were. Over a period of months, heavy flooding in India saw more than 2,000 deaths with millions of people displaced from their homes.  The value of the insured losses is estimated at $10bn. China  suffered even greater financial damage from flooding , running to around $32bn between June and October this year. The loss of life from these events was much smaller than in India. While these were slow-moving disasters, some events did enormous damage in a short period of time.  Cyclone Amphan  struck the Bay of Bengal in May  and caused losses estimated at $13bn in just a few days. \"We saw record temperatures in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, straddling between 30C-33C,\" said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. \"These high temperatures had the characteristics of marine heat waves that might have led to the rapid intensification of the pre-monsoon cyclones Amphan and Nisarga,\" he said in a comment on the Christian Aid study.   \"Amphan was one of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon season.\" Africa was also on the receiving end of extreme events, with  massive locust swarms  ruining crops and vegetation to the tune of $8.5bn. The UN has  linked these swarms  to climate change, with unusually heavy rains in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa in recent years contributing to the locust outbreaks. Europe also saw significant impacts when Storm Ciara  swept through  Ireland, the UK and several other countries in February.   It resulted in 14 lives being lost and damages of $2.7bn. Christian Aid stress that these figures for financial costs are likely an underestimate as they are based only on insured losses.  Richer countries have more valuable properties, and on the whole suffer greater financial penalties from extreme events. But financial losses don't convey the full impact of these storms and fires.  While South Sudan's  floods  weren't among the costliest in dollar terms, they have had a huge impact, killing 138 people and wiping out this year's crops. Researchers say that the influence of climate change on extreme events is strong and likely to continue growing.  This video can not be played \"Just like 2019 before it, 2020 has been full of disastrous extremes,\" said Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, from the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia. \"We have seen all this with a 1C of global average temperature rise, highlighting the sensitive relationship between average conditions and extremes.\" \"Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not averaged changes.\"  \"Unfortunately, we can expect more years to look like 2020 - and worse - as global temperatures creep higher.\" While 2021 is likely to bring a similar story of losses from extreme events, there is some sense of optimism that political leaders may be on the brink of taking steps that might help the world avoid the worst excesses of rising temperatures.  \"It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this climate change tide,\" said report author, Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. \"With President-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tom Heap BBC Radio 4 This year, 2021, a number of things are coming together to help achieve a low-carbon future. In 25 years of reporting the environment patch I've never been so convinced that the world has the potential to change.  It's about politics: recent bolder climate commitments from the UK, the EU, incoming American President Joe Biden and even China. It's about business: for the first time ever renewable energy investment will exceed that in fossil fuels. And it's about timing: a post-Covid recovery year running up to the global COP26 climate summit in November.  But mostly it's about ideas - an eruption of climate change solutions. Applied human intelligence is the vaccine against climate change. I've been  exploring 39 inspiring ideas  - some already happening, some in development - and meeting the people behind the projects, who each put a big grin on my face.  Here are five of the most intriguing:  BladeBUG is a rectangular robot which crawls over turbine blades. Imagine a suitcase that sprouted six legs with suction cup feet. Having humans on site to look after marine turbines is risky and expensive, making up 40% of their overall lifetime cost.  But drones will be able to carry BladeBUG to the offshore wind farm before it crawls over the tower and blades using sensors to detect damage or anything reducing its efficiency or lifespan. It can even fill and polish small defects itself.  The International Energy Agency says offshore wind could deliver 18 times today's global electricity demand - and innovations like this will make it even more affordable and achievable. The BladeBUG will undergo commercial trials this year and plans to reach the market in 2022. Growing rice has a similar climate impact to flying - about 2-3% of global warming. Paddy fields are like giant marshlands emitting huge quantities of methane.  Rothamsted Research, in Hertfordshire, has developed 'Direct Seeded Rice' (DSR) which doesn't need to be grown in a puddle so uses less water. The plant has also been bred to grow its first roots and shoots more rapidly which is vital for success in a conventional field system.  It's crossed with existing high-yield varieties and initial results are promising. The water in paddy fields does help to suppress weeds and so this system could need more herbicide but the developers believe farm-ready seeds will be ready in a couple of years with most of the world's rice grown this way in a decade.   Every seven seconds the sustainable forests of Europe yield enough wood to build a four-person family home. Carbon is absorbed by the growing trunk, locked up in the house and then trees are replanted. Wooden construction also lessens the enormous carbon impacts of using concrete and steel.  Cross Laminated Timber - like a super-thick plywood - enables the use of wood for large areas of floors and walls.  The French government has ruled that all new public buildings must be made from at least 50% timber and a 'plyscraper' race is under way with the 18-storey Mjosa Tower in Brumunddal, Norway the current winner.  Around the world taller buildings are on the drawing board but in the UK, building regulation changes in response to the Grenfell Tower fire might limit the use of wood in tall buildings.   In deepest Siberia, Nikita Zimov runs Pleistocene Park. Populated by musk-ox, wild horses and bison, it's like Jurassic Park but with a friendlier crowd. He wants to protect the frozen ground from thawing and releasing carbon in rising temperatures, but to achieve that he says something that sounds like heresy: \"Here trees worsen climate change\".  Arctic forest cover only arrived when humans killed most of the grazing animals including the now-extinct mammoth. As forests are a darker colour than snow-covered grassland, less of the sun's energy is reflected resulting in more ground heating.  Grazing animals also trample the snow to a thin layer which allows the chill of the air to penetrate into the ground, rather than allowing a thick fluffy snow layer to insulate it.  Nikita, and many supporters in Western universities, would like to see trees suppressed across a vast area of the tundra by mass introductions of grazing animals and some deliberate felling. For them, this would mean a re-wilding and potential re-cooling of the Arctic. The experimental park is 50 sq-miles (129.5 sq-km) but to have fuller impact he'd like it to be thousands of times bigger.  The International Energy Agency says solar electricity is now being made more cheaply than any other method of production. But solar panels currently only convert around a fifth of the sun's energy that falls on them into electricity. Sunlight is made up of the spectrum you see in a rainbow and silicon, found in nearly all solar panels, is best at converting the red part into electricity.  But UK-based company Oxford PV is combining silicon with a material called perovskite - a semi conductor mineral with a crystal structure of titanium calcium oxide - which turns the blue wavelengths into electrical energy. This chemical sandwich can increase the panels efficiency to 30-40%.  They are going into production this year and expect early applications to be on rooftops where customers want to maximise the wattage from a confined area.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent New data from EU satellites shows that 2020 is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the world's warmest year.  The  Copernicus Climate Change Service  says that last year was around 1.25C above the long-term average.  The scientists say that unprecedented levels of heat in the Arctic and Siberia were key factors in driving up the overall temperature.  The past 12 months also saw a new record for Europe, around 0.4C warmer than 2019. Last December, the World Meteorological Organization  predicted that 2020 would be one of the three warmest years on record .  This new, more complete report from Copernicus says that last year is right at the top of the list.  The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.  Temperature data from the system  shows that 2020 was 1.25C warmer than the average from 1850-1900, a time often described as the \"pre-industrial\" period. One key factor driving up the temperatures was the heating experienced in the Arctic and  Siberia .  In some locations there,  temperatures for the year  as a whole were 6C above the long-term average. This video can not be played This exceptional warming led to a very active wildfire season. Fires in the Arctic Circle released a record amount of CO2, according to the study, up over a third from 2019.  The Copernicus service concludes that while 2020 was very marginally cooler than 2016, the two years are statistically on a par as the differences between the figures for the two years are smaller than the typical differences found in other temperature databases for the same period. More data on 2020's temperature will be released in the next week or so from other agencies, including Nasa and the UK Met Office.  The scientists say that the closeness between the years is all the more remarkable considering the impacts of the El Ni\u00f1o\/La Ni\u00f1a weather cycle.  Twenty-sixteen was  made warmer by a strong El Ni\u00f1o event  while 2020 was  made slightly cooler by an emerging La Ni\u00f1a  in the second half of the year. Europe also saw a new record level of warming for the year, 0.4C warmer than 2019. A major heat wave in July and August was an important factor driving up the mercury across the continent.  Globally, the 10-year period from 2011-2020 is the warmest decade, with the last six years being the six hottest on record.  \"Twenty-twenty stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. \"It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future.\" While a strong La Ni\u00f1a may cool temperatures a little in 2021, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are likely to remain high, contributing to ongoing warming.  New data from the UK's Met Office suggests that average concentrations of CO2 will reach levels that are 50% higher than they were before the industrial revolution.  Researchers predict that annual average CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii will be around 2.29 parts per million (ppm) higher in 2021 than in 2020.  Despite the global slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientists say this rise is being driven by emissions from the use of fossil fuels and from deforestation. While weather patterns linked to the La Ni\u00f1a event may boost growth in tropical forests and increase the amount of the gas that's absorbed, it won't be enough to slow the overall rise.  The Met Office says that CO2 will exceed 417ppm in the atmosphere for several weeks from April to June.  This is 50% higher than the level of 278ppm that pertained in the late 18th Century as widespread industrial activity was just beginning.  \"The human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,\" said Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office. \"It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase.\" \"Reversing this trend and slowing the atmospheric CO2 rise will need global emissions to reduce, and bringing them to a halt will need global emissions to be brought down to net zero. This needs to happen within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter Look down on the Arctic from space and you can see some beautiful arch-like structures sculpted out of sea-ice. They form in a narrow channel called Nares Strait, which divides the Canadian archipelago from Greenland. As floes funnel southward down this restricted conduit, they ram up against the coastline to form a dam, and then everything comes to a standstill. \"They look just like the arches in a gothic cathedral,\" observes Kent Moore from the University of Toronto. \"And it's the same physics, even though it's ice. The stress is being distributed all along the arch and that's what makes it very stable,\" he told BBC News. But the UoT Mississauga professor is concerned that these \"incredible\" ice forms are actually being weakened in the warming Arctic climate. They're thinning and losing their strength, and this bodes ill, he believes, for the long-term retention of all sea-ice in the region. Directly to the north of Nares Strait is the Lincoln Sea. It's where you'll find some of the oldest, thickest floes in the Arctic Ocean. It's this ice that will be the \"last to go\" when, as the computer models predict, the Arctic becomes ice-free during summer months sometime this century. There are essentially two ways this old ice can be lost.  It can be melted in place in the rising temperatures or it can be exported. And it's this second mode that's in play in Nares Strait. The 40km-wide channel's arches act as a kind of valve on the amount of sea-ice that can be pushed out of the Arctic by currents and winds. When stuck solidly in place, typically from January onwards - the arches shut off all transport (sea-ice can still be exported from the Arctic via the Fram Strait, which is the passage between eastern Greenland and Svalbard).   But what Prof Moore's and colleagues' satellite research has shown is that these structures are becoming less reliable barriers. They are forming for shorter periods of time, and the amount of frozen material allowed to pass through the strait is therefore increasing as a consequence. \"We have about 20 years of data, and over that time the duration of these arches is definitely getting shorter,\" Prof Moore explained. \"We show that the average duration of these arches is decreasing by about a week every year. They used to last for 250-200 days and now they last for 150-100 days. And then as far as the transport goes - in the late 1990s to early 2000s, we were losing about 42,000 sq km of ice every year through Nares Strait; and now it's doubled: we're losing 86,000 sq km.\"  Prof Moore says we need to hang on to the oldest ice in the Arctic for as long as possible. If the world manages to implement the ambition of the Paris climate accord and global warming can be curtailed and reversed, then it's the thickest ice retained along the top of Canada and Greenland that will \"seed\" the rebound in the frozen floes. The area of oldest, thickest ice, he adds, is also going to be an important refuge for those species that depend on the floating floes for their way of life - the polar bears, walruses and seals.  \"My concern is that this last ice area may not last for as long as we think it will. This is ice that is five, six, even 10 years old; so if we lose it, it will take a long time to replenish even if we do eventually manage to cool the planet.\"  Prof Moore and colleagues have published their latest research in  the journal Nature Communications .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent US greenhouse gas emissions tumbled below their 1990 level for the first-time last year as a result of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.  A  preliminary assessment  from research group Rhodium says that overall emissions were down over 10%, the largest fall since World War II. Transport suffered the biggest decline, with emissions down almost 15% over 2019. Energy emissions also fell sharply, due to a decline in the use of coal. The  widespread impact of Covid-19 on the US  saw over 20 million people infected with the virus, and to date more than 350,000 have died as a result.  With stay-at-home orders in place, economic activity ground to a halt in March and April and this had significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions. In transport, the restrictions on international travel and non-essential journeys saw demand for fuel fall sharply.  At the peak of restrictions demand for jet fuel was down 68% on 2019, with petrol down 40%.  They have both bounced back as travel bans were eased later in the year but jet fuel demand was still 35% down in December compared to the previous year.  When it comes to electricity though the picture is more complicated.  Overall the demand for electricity was down just 2% but emissions fell by over 10%. \"This was driven almost exclusively from the continued rapid decline of coal-fired power generation,\" the report says. After decades of dominance, coal in 2020 was the third largest source of power, behind natural gas and nuclear.  Renewables now supply 18% of power, the report says, just behind coal with 20% of the market.  Based on the preliminary set of data for the year, the authors estimate that overall US emissions fell below 1990 levels for the first time in three decades.  The overall fall of 10.3% essentially dwarves the impact of the great economic recession of 2009 on the US, when emissions were down 6.3%. In global climate negotiations, the US uses 2005 as its benchmark year. Compared to 2005 levels, emissions in 2020 were 21.5% down, exceeding the target the US set for itself under the Copenhagen Accord of 2009. Under the Paris Agreement, the US has promised to cut emissions by 26-28% below the 2005 mark, but the authors of the Rhodium report caution against thinking that the country is now on track to reach this target.  Last year \"certainly shouldn't be considered a down payment towards meeting the US target under the Paris Agreement,\" the report says.  \"The enormous toll of economic damage and human suffering as a result of the pandemic is no cause for celebration.\" Economic growth is expected to reach 3-4% of GDP in 2021 and greenhouse gas emissions will likely increase as well.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Make no mistake, returning to the Paris climate agreement is not mere symbolism - it is an act cloaked in powerful, political significance.  While re-joining the pact was actually quite simple - the signing of a letter on Biden's first day in office and then a 30-day wait which ends on Friday - there could be no more profound signal of intention from this incoming administration. Coming back to Paris means the US will once again have to follow the rules. Those rules mean that sometime this year the US will need to improve on their previous commitment, made in the French capital in 2015, to cut carbon emissions. This new target, possibly for 2030, and President Biden's commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, will be the guide rails for the US economy and society for decades to come. Coming back to Paris really means it is no longer \"America First\".  It signals that the spirit of that awkward word, \"multilateralism\", is alive and well and living once again in the White House.  But the US also needs to tread carefully and remember that the world's perspective on climate change has moved on since the Obama days. \"I think the United States needs to recognise that the world is very different than it was four years ago and enter in, in partnership and humility, not coming back in telling everybody what they should be doing, because the world's gone on,\" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. \"I think the expectation's there, if you look at global climate politics, that climate will now play a role in security policy. \"Fossil fuels are like weapons of mass destruction - they need to be kept in the ground.\" That sentiment found an echo in President Biden's other executive action on his first day.  His  cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline permit  is a carefully calculated message to the oil industry. \"This new executive order on the Keystone pipeline is a very tangible, visible decision,\" said R\u00e9my Rioux, the head of the French development agency and a negotiator for the French government during the Paris climate talks.  \"The US is saying 'we're back' - and 'not only are we back on track, but we're back with a fuller commitment and momentum'.\" During his time in office, President Trump did his utmost to remove what he perceived as unnecessary barriers and red tape to the freedoms of industry and commerce.  This drive seemed especially powerful when it came to anything related to climate change.  At the Columbia University  Sabin Center for Climate Change Law  in New York, researchers have tracked around 175 rollback actions taken by the Trump administration to eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures.  With President Biden  vowing to overturn the rollbacks , Prof Michael Gerrard, who runs the Sabin Center, explained what his top three targets should be and why. The new president has highlighted the existential threat posed by climate change. It is, along with the pandemic, the economy and racial justice, one of the four cornerstone crises facing the new administration.  But climate change is also threaded through each of the others, and tackling the root causes of rising temperatures can benefit these other pressing problems as well.  There's a slightly more elegant word for it derived from the natural world - symbiosis. In the way that bees spread the pollen of flowers while gathering nectar for themselves, it refers to the interaction between different organisms to the advantage of both.  \"People in the US are seeing the hurricane, they're seeing the fires, they're seeing the droughts, and they know that something needs to be done,\" said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. \"The good news is that so many of the climate solutions can boost the economy, can generate jobs.  \"It's not a trade-off between tackling the economic situation and tackling the climate crisis; in fact, they have to go hand in hand.\" In the days ahead, we'll get a clearer view of how the new president will aim to tackle these challenges.   While  campaigning , he highlighted electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, building high-speed railways, and improving energy efficiency in homes and offices. Tackling the energy sector remains key though, with  President Biden committed to 100% clean electricity by 2035. To get there, the Biden team may push Congress to pass a clean electricity standard that would set a target for green energy but leave it up to utilities to find the best way to meet the goal.  There may also be a significant effort to rollback what environmentalists would see as the Trump administration's watering down of the National Environmental Policy Act, known as  Nepa . This 50-year-old law allowed federal agencies to examine big infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and power plants, for their environmental impacts. Crucially, it could evaluate the cumulative climate change impact of these ventures.  This element was removed by the Trump administration. \"I think it will be a really important rollback if the US wants to reach net zero by 2050,\" said Prof Pam McElwee from Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"Nepa would be able to help with that long-term strategy, to help the US move away from building fossil fuel infrastructure. It could be a pretty strong tool in that arsenal.\" While political opposition in Congress may see some compromises in the spirit of unity that President Biden underlined in his inaugural address, some experts don't see that as the biggest obstacle in Biden's path.  \"I would say if anything that the biggest barrier is the physics of climate change,\" said Prof McElwee. \"The fact that we have to catch up makes things really, really challenging. And the scale of the challenge is really pretty overwhelming.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The government has been pressured into calling a public inquiry into a proposed new coal mine in Cumbria. The county council at first approved the colliery, and the government decided not to challenge the decision. After an outcry from environmentalists, the council decided to review its decision. But now ministers have taken over the process, following weeks of angry criticism from climate experts and campaigners. A firm applied for planning permission to dig for coking coal in Cumbria, and councillors approved the bid. They said the scheme did not contravene planning rules and would help diversify jobs. But coal is seen as the dirtiest of the fossil fuels driving up global temperatures. The British government heads a UN climate summit in November and has launched the Powering Past Coal alliance of nations to relinquish coal. Fiji is an alliance member - and its UN ambassador Satyendra Prasad told me opening a new mine sends the wrong signal.  \"Investment in renewables in place of coal is the morally correct choice,\" he said. \"In the global climate struggle, words are extremely important. Deeds matter even more.\"  This was a thorny decision.  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick could have overridden the council but, amid the turmoil of the January Covid lockdown, he put out a notice saying he would not block permission because it was a \"local\" issue.  Environmentalists were furious, saying climate change was the ultimate global problem.  The government later told me there were no grounds to block the application under planning law. A spokesperson said leaving the decision to the council aligned with the Tory principle of having decisions taken at the lowest possible tier of government. But then the council itself decided to review its approval of the mine, because councillors said they hadn't taken the climate change question into account in their discussions. Ultimately, the government decided it would review the issue itself, with a public debate over the issues involved. Yes. The mine lies in the Copeland constituency in a cluster of so-called \"red wall\" seats won by the Conservatives from Labour.  Cumbria has low unemployment (2.8% from July 2019-June 2020 compared with 3.4% in Copeland and 3.8% nationally) but local MPs argued that well-paid manual jobs shouldn't be turned away.  The Copeland MP Trudy Harrison is the prime minister's parliamentary aide and it's hard to conceive that she did not drop a word in his ear, although she wouldn't talk to me about that. They insist they're not. The key to the debate, they say, is that the mine will produce coking coal, which is needed for steel.  The government is phasing out thermal coal for power stations by 2025 but has not announced any plans to phase out coking coal.  The advisory Climate Change Committee says the UK must stop burning coking coal by 2035 in order to hit climate targets. I understand the committee fears that if the mine goes ahead its owners and workers will lobby to keep it running after that date. But the MPs fear that the technology to create steel using non-coal methods such as hydrogen won't be ready by 2035.  Mark Jenkinson, Tory MP for nearby Workington, told me: \"It's better for the environment to dig coking coal from Workington than from Wyoming, because it saves on emissions from transport. We can't let other countries pick up the tab for emissions on our behalf.\" Environmentalists have long called for a moratorium on new fossil fuels.  When John Sauven, from Greenpeace, heard that approving the mine was considered a local decision he said: \"Let's hope China doesn't take the same view - or the world will be toast\". He's written to Boris Johnson saying: \"As host of the largest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, it is mystifying that a new coal mine has been approved.  \"This will make it much harder to fulfil the ambitions of the alliance to phase out coal. We call on you to reverse the decision\". Labour's Climate Change lead Matthew Pennycook agreed. \"This makes a mockery of the government's claim to be a climate leader, and won't provide the long-term job security Cumbrians deserve,\" he said.  \"Decarbonised steel is the future and Ministers should be relentlessly focused on developing an active industrial strategy that will attract good, low-carbon jobs and investment to counties like Cumbria.\" The Liberal Democrats and Greens agree. The government will hold a public inquiry to allow supporters of the mine and environmentalists to put their opposing cases.  There's no timetable for the inquiry yet, but the government will be hoping that the controversy has been kicked into the long grass until at least after it hosts the UN climate summit in November. Environmentalists will doubtless accuse the government of failing to take a stand. The inquiry will examine evidence from the Climate Change Committee against the mine, and the counter-case from those who believe the mine is needed to support the UK steel industry. In effect, climate strategy and industrial strategy will both be on trial. In the meantime, pressure will increase on ministers to agree policies that will stimulate green jobs in West Cumbria, which has an unemployment rate just below the national average, but where jobs are heavily concentrated in the nuclear sector at Sellafield.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The leading climate scientist James Hansen has warned Boris Johnson that he risks \u201chumiliation\u201c over plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. The UK government, which hosts a climate summit this year, has allowed the mine at Whitehaven to go ahead. Dr Hansen, formerly Nasa's leading global warming researcher, urged the PM to halt production - or be \"vilified\". No 10 said the UK was a world leader on climate change, but would not reverse the local council decision on the mine. In his letter, Dr Hansen - whose testimony before the US Senate helped raise wider awareness of global warming back in 1988 - writes: \"In leading the [climate conference], you have a chance to change the course of our climate trajectory, earning the UK and yourself historic accolades. \"Or you can stick with business-almost-as-usual and be vilified around the world.  \u201cIt would be easy to achieve this latter ignominy and humiliation - just continue with the plan to open a new coal mine in Cumbria in contemptuous disregard of the future of young people and nature.  \u201cThe contrary path is not so easy, but, with your leadership, it is realistic.\u201d Downing Street said the UK is cutting emissions faster than any major economy and would end the use of coal for electricity by 2025. Ministers have defended the decision over the coal mine as a local planning matter, but have stressed that industries such as steel production require coking coal - which would have to be imported if it was not produced in the UK. A No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister would continue to urge countries to pursue \"clean economic recoveries\" as the UK hosts the COP26 summit in Glasgow this November - the climate meeting to which Mr Hansen refers. Keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C is considered crucial for avoiding the worst effects of global warming. Last week, US climate envoy John Kerry told the BBC that Glasgow will be the \u201clast best chance\u201c the world has for tackling the climate crisis. Dr Hansen's letter may prove uncomfortable for Mr Johnson, as it has been copied to Mr Kerry. The letter continues: \u201cPrime Minister Johnson, young people are fed up \u2013 and for good reason. They demand that political leaders follow the science and take the actions needed to preserve and restore a healthy climate. \u201cIf this [conference] is like the prior ones \u2013 with soothing words and worthless ambitions \u2013 they will be justifiably outraged.\u201d The new coal mine was agreed by Cumbria County Council.  The government said approval was a matter for the council, defending the decision by the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick not to exercise his powers to overrule the local authority. The mine will produce coking coal - a grade that is used in steel-making. Although 85% of it is destined for export to Europe, government sources hinted that a need for continuing domestic steel production was another reason for not opposing the mine. Dr Hansen does acknowledge the UK\u2019s previous climate leadership and its success in reducing emissions. \u201cYour progress reflects well on your parliamentary democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife and I were fortunate to witness the efforts of UK citizens and political leaders during the past two decades as that progress was achieved. This video can not be played \"It is our fervent hope that the UK will continue to provide leadership and affect the entire planet.\u201d The letter amplifies criticism at the weekend from the government\u2019s advisory body on global warming, the Climate Change Committee (CCC). It says the Cumbrian mine will increase global emissions and compromise the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budgets. The CCC said: \u201cThe decision to award planning permission [for the mine] to 2049 will commit the UK to emissions from coking coal.\u201c The body said coking coal will have to stop by 2035 if the country is to meet its climate change targets. In response to the CCC\u2019s letter, a government statement said the decision to allow the coal mine would not be reversed. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Sharanjit Leyl BBC News The world is heading for mortality rates equivalent to the Covid crisis every year by mid-century unless action is taken, according to Mark Carney. The former central banker said the investment needed to avert millions of deaths was double current rates. But with governments ploughing billions into keeping economies afloat, a question mark hangs over whether the recovery will be green enough. The answer lies in smarter investment, Mr Carney said. Mr Carney, who was the Bank of England governor up until last year, and the head of the Bank of Canada before that, is now the United Nations envoy for climate action and finance. He told the BBC that while there were parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change, damage to the environment and ecosystems has the potential to cause many more deaths. \"One of the biggest issues is you cannot self-isolate from climate,\" he said. \"That is not an option. We cannot retreat in and wait out climate change, it will just get worse,\" he told Talking Business Asia: The Climate Change Challenge. \"When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event. So it is an issue that needs to be addressed now.\" But governments pouring trillions of dollars into stimulus plans to rescue their ailing economies are mainly addressing job losses and the economic damage inflicted from lockdowns. Very little of that cash is heading towards reducing carbon emissions, although emissions have fallen in the past year because people aren't travelling as much. Mr Carney, who is tasked with persuading policymakers, chief executives, bankers and investors to focus on the environment, said: \"The scale of investment in energy, sustainable energy and sustainable infrastructure needs to double. \"Every year, for the course of the next three decades, $3.5 trillion (\u00a32.5tn) a year, for 30 years. It is an enormous investment opportunity.\" He said the answer lies in a global pot of $170tn of private capital which, he says, \"is looking for disclosure\". Banks, investment funds and individuals increasingly want to know how their money will be used. It is not just about disclosing the carbon position of companies, he says, but \"where it's going to go tomorrow in order to make these kinds of investment and lending decisions\".  That pot is bigger than the total economic output of the world for a year, he said. \"The issue is about putting that money to work.\" Mr Carney said that as the US returns to the world stage in the battle against climate change, there's renewed momentum to the issue, especially as last year China, the world's largest polluter,  aimed to become carbon neutral by 2060 . Although China continues to build coal-fired power plants, and draws about 70% of its power from fossil fuel, the country is a crucial part of the solution. \"There clearly are issues in terms of coal in China, and the sooner China moves on that, the better for them and for the world. \"But China also produces 60% of the global solar photovoltaic panels. It is also the largest producer of electric vehicles. So China has many sides to this.\" The US has the \"largest and most sophisticated financial sector\" along with the \"engineering and technological expertise\" to get to net zero emissions, he said. Part of his role at the UN is to tap into this financial sector. It is the \"power of money\" that will ultimately play the biggest role in combating climate change, he said. \"We're getting the system in a position where, whether it's a bank, or somebody who's investing a small amount of savings in the market, or your pension, they can choose [how it is invested]. \"They have the information and they can choose to be part of the solution, transitioning to net zero, or be part of the problem.\" You can watch the full interview with Mark Carney on Talking Business Asia on BBC World News this weekend.

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC News New targets to eliminate the gases driving climate change from Wales' economy and way of life are to become law. The Welsh Government said \"business as usual\" was no longer an option. Changing weather patterns are already \"wreaking havoc\" and acting now is \"the right thing to do for our children and grandchildren\", it says. The move brings Wales into line with the  UK push for \"net zero emissions\" by 2050 . However, environment minister Lesley Griffiths said she wanted to \"get there sooner\". It will mean huge upheaval - from replacing hundreds of thousands of gas boilers in people's homes, to potentially finding new ways of making steel at Port Talbot without burning coal.   But the process will lead to new green jobs, and improvements to people's health while meeting international obligations to try and avoid a dangerous rise in global temperatures, the government said.   It will publish a revised action plan ahead of the major UN climate change conference - COP26 - in Glasgow later this year. Advisers at the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) have already warned Wales is not on track to meet existing, less stringent goals to slash emissions. By 2018 - the latest year for which data is available - Wales had seen a 31% fall in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1990 levels. New legal targets will force a 63% reduction by 2030 and 89% by 2040, with Wales reaching 'net zero' - effectively a 100% cut - by 2050. Any gases still produced then would need to be very limited and strictly managed - for example, they would need to be entirely soaked back through carbon capture technologies, trees or peatbogs. The government said it was accepting the recommendations made by the CCC in a report to Welsh ministers in December. It had described the 2020s as a \"crucial decade\" if targets were to be achieved. The advisers said a net zero Wales was possible with action on uptake of low-carbon vehicles and boilers, while industry in south Wales needed to work together to move away from fossil fuels or install carbon capture and storage technology by the mid 2030s. Low carbon electricity generation needed to shift from 27% now to 100% by 2035, and buildings better insulated so less power was used and wasted. By 2030, 43,000 hectares of mixed woodland must be planted, the advisers said, increasing to 180,000 hectares by 2050 - to soak up emissions. Action was needed at both a UK and Welsh government level, according to the CCC. Nick Pidgeon, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University, said the announcement was \"hugely significant\". Industry, transport, housing and agriculture were all big contributors to Welsh emissions, he said, and would require \"sustained attention over the next few years\". \"And it needs to start now - although we think about the 2050 target... greenhouse gas emissions stay up in the atmosphere for a long time,\" he said. \"So, the sooner you start on that journey to net zero the better - because you will then be putting less up over the next 20 to 30 years.\" Biologist and broadcaster Lizzie Daly told BBC Radio Wales that reducing carbon emissions was \"one of the biggest challenges of our time\".  She said: \"A lot of our land in Wales is farmland, so working with people who have that land and use it to create better environmental outcomes is crucial. \"We need to see bigger changes in our transport around cities, Cardiff and Swansea are doing lots to help minimise the impact of vehicle emissions and help with air quality. \"If we are to meet these goals we have to get a move on.\" Ms Griffiths said the global climate outlook was \"grave\", and \"as with Covid, climate change will impact us all, but the stark reality remains that our most vulnerable communities will be hit the hardest.\" \"Through Covid we have shown a Team Wales effort that has saved lives and protected our NHS, and I am calling on everyone to use the same spirit to build the Wales we want for our future generations.\" Plaid Cymru's shadow minister, Delyth Jewell, said the party would implement a \u00a36bn \"green economic stimulus\" if it gains a majority in this year's Senedd elections.  She said: \"To tackle climate change we have to be ambitious. It's been two years since the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency but empty words have been followed by little action.\" Wales 'must take advantage' of UK's climate summit Welsh farmers told to cut more carbon emissions Call to ban new roads as part of climate challenge Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Despite the pandemic, almost two thirds of people around the world now view climate change as a global emergency. That's the key finding from the  largest opinion poll yet conducted  on tackling global warming.  More than a million people in 50 countries took part in the survey, with almost half the participants aged between 14 and 18. Conserving forests and land emerged as the most popular solution for tackling the issue.  The poll, called the \"People's Climate Vote\", has been organised by the United Nations Development Programme in conjunction with Oxford University. The organisers distributed poll questions through adverts in mobile gaming apps across 50 countries, between October and December last year.  Around 1.22 million people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds took part, but with significant numbers of younger people.  Some 550,000 people aged 14-18 took part.  Across all countries, 64% of participants saw climate change as an emergency, requiring urgent responses from countries.  The margin of error was +\/- 2%. This result varied somewhat by age and location. In the UK and Italy, 81% agreed with the question, while this dropped to 50% among those responding from Moldova. Newly installed US President Joe Biden can take some comfort that 65% of those in the US taking part now view climate change as an emergency. Overall, younger people were more likely to agree with the view that rising temperatures were an emergency, with nearly 70% in favour.  For people over the age of 60, this dropped to 58%.  \"People are scared, they are seeing the the wildfires in Australia and California, they're seeing the category five storms and in the Caribbean, they are seeing flooding in in Southeast Asia,\" said Cassie Flynn, strategic adviser to the UNDP. \"And they're looking around them and they're saying, this is a real problem. We have to do something about this.\" The actions that people tend to favour when it comes to tackling climate change depend, to some extent, on where people live.  In eight of the 10 countries with the highest emissions from generating electricity, there were majorities in favour of using more green energy. But in countries with bigger emissions from deforestation and land use changes, there was majority support for conserving forests and land.  This emerged from the overall survey as the most popular policy for dealing with climate change, by a narrow margin. The least-favoured options for tackling climate change in this survey were a plant-based diet, with only 30% of respondents believing it to be the best.  Germany, with 44%, and the UK, with 43%, were the countries where plant-based diets received the strongest support.  The authors say that across all countries, remarkably few people declined to support any policy. Pakistan emerged as the country with the greatest number of people not favouring any policy, at 5%. It was followed by the United States, with 4%. One of the key differences that emerged in the data was the level of education.  \"When it comes to demographics, something that we saw very clearly was that there is a high correlation between a level of education and belief in the climate emergency. The more educated you are, the more likely you are to believe that there is a climate emergency,\" said Cassie Flynn. \"And this is really, really powerful, because it doesn't matter where you're from, it doesn't matter your age, education really, really is important.\" While the overall findings show roughly the same responses from men and women, there were quite pronounced differences at the country level. In Canada, women and girls were 12% more likely to say that climate change is an emergency than men and boys. The US, UK and Australia had smaller differences in the same direction.  In contrast, India, Georgia, Vietnam and Nigeria went in the opposite direction, with men and boys being 9-12% more likely to say that warming is an emergency.  With a new president in the White House who is making climate change a priority, and with a key global conference taking place in Glasgow later this year, the organisers of the poll believe that it is an important time for world leaders to hear a wide range of voices on climate change. \"How they respond to the climate crisis, how they respond to the Covid crisis, is really going to chart an entirely new pathway. And so in many ways, it is this moment of choice,\" said Cassie Flynn from UNDP. \"And what we wanted to do with the people's climate vote is to bring people's voices to that decision making, to bring people's voices to the climate debate.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent This video can not be played Fifty-one billion and zero - the two numbers Bill Gates says you need to know about climate. Solving climate change would be \"the most amazing thing humanity has ever done\", says the billionaire founder of Microsoft. By comparison, ending the pandemic is \"very, very easy\", he claims. Mr Gates's new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, is a guide to tackling global warming. Don't underestimate the scale of the challenge, he told me when we spoke last week.  \"We've never made a transition like we're talking about doing in the next 30 years. There is no precedent for this.\" Fifty-one billion is how many tonnes of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere each year. Net zero is where we need to get to.  This means cutting emissions to a level where any remaining greenhouse gas releases are balanced out by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. One way to do this is by planting trees, which soak up CO2 through their leaves. Mr Gates' focus is on how technology can help us make that journey. Renewable sources like wind and solar can help us decarbonise electricity but, as Mr Gates points out, that's less than 30% of total emissions. We are also going to have to decarbonise the other 70% of the world economy - steel, cement, transport systems, fertiliser production and much, much more. We simply don't have ways of doing that at the moment for many of these sectors. The answer, says Mr Gates, will be an innovation effort on a scale the world has never seen before. This has to start with governments, he argues. At the moment, the economic system doesn't price in the real cost of using fossil fuels.  Most users don't pay anything for the damage to the environment done by pollution from the petrol in their car or the coal or gas that created the electricity in their home.  \"Right now, you don't see the pain you're causing as you emit carbon dioxide,\" is how Mr Gates puts it. That's why he says governments have to intervene.  \"We need to have price signals to tell the private sector that we want green products,\" he says.  That is going to require a huge investment by governments in research and development, Mr Gates argues, as well as support to allow the market for new products and technologies to grow, thereby helping drive down prices. Yet Mr Gates was famous for arguing that regulation stifled innovation when he was building Microsoft into the multi-billion-dollar behemoth it is now.  So isn't it a bit rich for him now to demand government intervention?   He replies he has always supported \"the basic role of government in terms of roads and justice and education and scientific research\". And, on the climate issue, he maintains it will be impossible to avoid a disaster, particularly for those who live near the equator, without governments around the world getting behind the effort. The Republican Party in America needs to recognise the importance of tackling climate change, says Mr Gates. This needs to be a \"constant 30-year push\", he maintains. \"Business just can't change all that physical infrastructure unless the market signals are constant and very clear.\" Simply consuming less stuff - fewer flights, local food, less electricity and gas - won't solve the problem.   \"India is going to build housing for their people, provide lighting at night, air conditioning to make conditions liveable,\" Mr Gates believes, so global demand will not reduce. He argues political action is more important, demanding government do the right thing, and, using our voices as consumers, insisting the same of companies. \"If you buy an electric car, a hamburger made of a meat substitute, an electric heat pump for your home you are helping increase the production of these products and therefore helping drive prices down.\" Mr Gates still enjoys the trappings of the billionaire lifestyle.    He uses private jets, but insists that they are powered by biofuels - aviation fuels made from plant products. \"I pay three times as much now for my aviation fuel, you know, over $7m [\u00a35m] a year in all my offset spending.\"  And  he has joined a \u00a33bn bidding war  to buy one of the world's largest private jet services companies, a business called Signature Aviation. Is that appropriate when you've just written a book telling the world how to avoid a climate disaster? \"I don't think getting rid of flying would make sense,\" he replies. \"That type of brute force technique won't get us there.\" He says the answer has to be \"a type of aviation fuel that doesn't cost much extra and is zero emission and that's got to be biofuels or electric fuels or perhaps using green hydrogen to power the plane\". Mr Gates has become something of a  bogeyman for coronavirus conspiracy theorists. He has been accused of everything from concocting the virus in a secret laboratory as part of a project by global elites to depopulate the world, to using vaccinations to implant microchips in people to track and control them. He laughs when asked about this. \"Why would I want to track people? You know, I'm just not that interested in where people are going.\" The main focus for his huge charitable efforts to date has been tackling health issues in developing countries.  He tells me he is used to people getting bored when he talks about tuberculosis and malaria at cocktail parties, so this is a real change from what he calls \"the normal obscurity of working on infectious disease\". But he says he was worried that speaking out on climate might attract similar controversy.   \"I don't want to dilute my voice on issues like polio eradication or malaria,\" Mr Gates explains, but says he felt this was the right time to publish his plan for tackling climate change.   He says he wants his ideas to feed into the green stimulus packages being proposed around the world and to be discussed in the run-up to the crucial  climate conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow  in November this year.  We are at a crucial point in the climate debate, Mr Gates believes. He describes the young generation as having a \"moral conviction\" that they have to be involved in bringing change on the issue.   \"Now we have to take that energy and make sure it's directed at the policies that will make a difference,\" he argues. But it isn't going to be easy, he warns.  This has to continue to be a huge priority for the world year in, year out. The hope is \"we get a bit lucky\" and succeed in developing innovative new technologies that really do solve the hard areas, he says. But he is optimistic that we can still avoid the worst effects of climate change.   \"You know, I've seen many times, innovation surprises us in a positive way.\" Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst MPs are complaining that the Treasury is set to claw back money from a mismanaged government scheme to help people insulate their homes. The Green Homes Grant scheme is in such chaos that a huge majority of its \u00a31.5bn budget for this year is unspent.  The government has said it will pocket that money, rather than rolling it over to next year\u2019s \u00a3320m fund. But the Environmental Audit Committee says that would be a \u201cdeeply retrograde step\u201d. Conservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the committee, told the BBC: \u201cWe need a long-term commitment to helping people insulate their homes \u2013 at the very least until the end of this Parliament. \u201cWe (Conservatives) promised \u00a39.2bn for energy efficiency in our manifesto \u2013 and we have to deliver that or we won\u2019t reach our climate change targets.\u201d The government\u2019s advisory Climate Change Committee says even more - \u00a32bn of public money a year - is needed until 2030.  The current green homes programme has been heavily criticised, with householders unable to get quotes from registered contractors and the firms unable to get paid. In a parliamentary answer on Tuesday, the government confirmed only \u00a394.1m of the \u00a31.5bn allocated for homes in England until April has so far been spent.  Mr Dunne said: \u201cThe Green Homes Grant scheme is a good idea but its implementation has been woeful.\" He said the scheme designed to create jobs and improve energy efficiency had turned into a \u201cjob destruction\u201d scheme because so many builders laid off their workers when government payments didn't come through.  Mr Dunne said the project had been devised with too much bureaucracy because Treasury officials didn\u2019t want a repeat of Northern Ireland's  Northern Ireland's \"cash for ash\" renewable heat scheme,  where millions of pounds were lost because rules were badly devised.  As a result of the red tape, he said, small builders in the Federation of Master Builders were reluctant to apply for accreditation.  Mr Dunne said out of 7,400 members of the federation, only three had been accredited. Mr Dunne\u2019s committee says the government needs to invest heavily in carbon-cutting measures as part of the its response to Covid-19.  In a report, it has urged the government to create \u201cgreen\u201d jobs by investing in areas such as energy efficiency, nature recovery and adaptation to a heating climate.  It wants the government to: Mr Dunne said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis must be treated as a wake-up call - it is a symptom of a growing ecological emergency.  \u201cA tax system fit for net-zero Britain is key. It will encourage innovation, give confidence to the sector and support companies to make the low-carbon transition.\u201d The MPs also say ministers should also set targets for  the huge amounts of carbon generated  to make steel and cement for new buildings.  This idea is gaining traction, because it would increase the use in construction of wood products that have soaked up CO2.  Will Hurst from the Architects' Journal said: \"For far too long we have ignored the carbon footprints of (constructing) buildings, worrying only about their energy efficiency once built.  \"Regulations actually encourage this state of affairs. The VAT system perversely incentivises wasteful demolition and rebuild while upfront or \u2018embodied\u2019 carbon emissions in construction are largely ignored in planning policy.\" Caterina Brandmayr from the think tank Green Alliance said: \u201cThe report rightly puts the spotlight on what the government still needs to do to deliver a green recovery.  \u201cFront-loading investment in climate solutions, nature and the circular economy, and ensuring recovery plans are consistent with climate and environmental goals must be a priority. This will help create jobs, and benefit businesses and communities across the country.\u201d A government spokesman said the Treasury was examining ways to fund the UK's transition to net zero emissions and ministers were \"committed to building back better and greener from the pandemic\". The prime minister's recently announced 10-point  climate change plan  will \"put the UK at the forefront of the global green industrial revolution and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs,\" the spokesman added. \"We continue to bring forward bold measures to cut emissions, with plans to invest \u00a39bn in improving the energy efficiency of buildings forming part of our wider commitment to end our contribution to climate change by 2050.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Free home insulation: Too good to be true?

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter Wherever you look in West Antarctica right now, the message is the same: Its marine-terminating glaciers are being melted by warm seawater. Scientists have just taken a detailed look at the ice streams flowing into the ocean along a 1,000km-stretch of coastline known as the Getz region. It incorporates 14 glaciers - and they've all speeded up. Since 1994, they've lost 315 gigatonnes of ice - equivalent to 126 million Olympic swimming pools of water. If you put this in the context of the Antarctic continent's contribution to global sea-level rise over the same period, Getz accounts for just over 10% of the total - a little under a millimetre.  \"This is the first time anyone has done a really detailed study of this area of West Antarctica. It's very inaccessible to people to go and do field work because it's so mountainous; most of it hasn't ever been stepped on by humans,\" explained Heather Selley, a glaciologist at the  Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling  at the University of Leeds, UK.  \"But it's really important we understand what's going on there - to recognise its glaciers are speeding up and the reason why,\" she told BBC News. Selley and colleagues examined two and a half decades of satellite radar data on ice velocity and thickness. To this analysis, they added information about ocean properties immediately offshore of Getz - along with the outputs of a model that put the local climate in context over the period. The findings,  published in the journal Nature Communications , reveal an unambiguous linear trend. On average, the speed of all 14 glaciers in the region increased by almost a quarter between 1994 and 2018, with the velocity of three central glaciers increasing by more than 40%. One particular ice stream was found to be flowing 391m\/year faster in 2018 than it was in 1994 - a 59% increase in just two and a half decades. The probable cause, once again, is what researchers call \"ocean forcing\". Relatively warm deep ocean water is getting under the glaciers' floating fronts and melting them from below.  Pierre Dutrieux, a study co-author at British Antarctic Survey, said: \"We know that warmer ocean waters are eroding many of West Antarctica's glaciers, and these new observations demonstrate the impact this is having on the Getz region. \"This new data will provide a new perspective of the processes taking place so we can predict future change with more certainty.\" Where a line of glaciers pushes out into the sea their floating fronts will often join together to form a single, continuous platform known as an ice shelf. It's interesting to note that in the case of Getz, this platform receives a certain stability from pressing up against eight islands and a number of shallow points on the seabed.  And yet, even with this in-built stability, the feeding glaciers behind are melting and speeding up.  Co-author Anna Hogg, also from Leeds, is an expert in satellite remote-sensing of the polar regions. She told BBC News: \"We have observations now around the whole margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in a way we've never had before. We're able to map really detailed, localised patterns of change. \"We're understanding how ocean water is moving around underneath the ice shelf - how and where it's getting in to that cavity under the shelf, so that we can really tie the physical process of ocean forcing to the signal we see in the satellite data.\"  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"\"Climate change is a threat to our security,\" Boris Johnson told world leaders as he chaired a United Nations Security Council session. It is the first time a British PM has chaired such a meeting since 1992. Other speakers included broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Sudanese climate activist Nisreen Elsaim. The UK holds the presidency of the Security Council this month and hosts the COP26 climate summit in November. The summit in Glasgow will be attended by dozens of world leaders and is likely to be the most significant round of talks since the global Paris Agreement to tackle climate change was secured in 2015. At the council meeting, Mr Johnson said some would argue \"all this green stuff from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu-munchers\" is not a suitable subject for a UN meeting. \"I couldn't disagree more profoundly,\" he said adding that the council need to act to protect \"peace, security and stability\" around the world. \"Whether you like it or not it is a matter of when, not if, your country and your people will have to deal with the security impact of climate change,\" he said. He also highlighted measures the UK was taking to reduce emissions and stressed the importance of helping vulnerable countries \"adapt and build resilience\". A Greenpeace spokesperson accused the PM of \"weapons-grade hypocrisy\" for demanding action while \"planning new coal mines at home and stripping funds for carbon-cutting energy efficiency measures\".  \"Until the government starts taking the prime minister's advice, his climate leadership will lack any credibility,\" they said. This is the latest in a series of prime ministerial rallying calls on climate change.  The year is providing a remarkable stage for Boris Johnson's ambition on the topic - from the Security Council to the chairmanship of G7 in June, culminating in the vital Glasgow climate summit in November. But as he bestrides the global stage, the PM is under fire for his performance at home. His crucial project to cut emissions from home heating - the  Green Homes Grant  - is in disarray, with the chancellor pulling out funds. His government is building the high-speed rail HS2, which is likely to be adding to carbon emissions until the back half of the century. And he's promoting a \u00a327bn road-building programme. What's more, the PM is risking his international reputation by permitting  a new coal mine in Cumbria  while urging other nations to relinquish coal.  Environmentalists say it's time for him to match words with deeds. Follow Roger on Twitter  @rharrabin Speaking at the start of the meeting, Sir David said climate change posed \"threats to security of a new and unprecedented kind\". He said changes in patterns of weather would \"turn forests into deserts and drown great cities\". And he warned that the world is \"perilously close to tipping points that once past will send global temperatures spiralling catastrophically higher\". \"If we continue on this path we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security - food production, access to water, ambient temperatures and ocean food chains,\" he said. However he also said the COP26 conference, new technologies and public support for change offered \"grounds for hope\". This video can not be played Ms Elsaim - who chairs the UN's Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change - told the meeting that her country of Sudan was top of the list \"when it comes to climate instability\".  She said drought and food insecurity would lead to large-scale migration making \"conflict inevitable\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The world will heat by more than 1.5C unless nations produce tougher policies, a global stocktake has confirmed. Governments must halve emissions by 2030 if they intend the Earth to stay within the 1.5C \u201csafe\u201d threshold.  But the latest set of national policies submitted to the UN shows emissions will merely be stabilised by 2030. The UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called it a red alert for our planet.   He said: \"It shows governments are nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees and meet the goals of the Paris (Climate) Agreement.    \"The major emitters must step up with much more ambitious emissions reductions targets.\" Dr Niklas Hohne from the New Climate Institute told BBC News: \"There is a huge gap to fill if we are serious about 1.5C (the threshold nations have agreed not to pass). \"Global emissions have to be halved \u2013 but with current proposals they will only be stable. That\u2019s really not good enough.\" Some nations have not even submitted a climate plan, and some \u2013 such as Australia \u2013 are judged to have offered no substantial improvement on previous proposals.  Emissions from those countries doing little or nothing extra comprise 10-15% of global emissions. Mexico and Brazil have attracted criticism for not doing more.  There are some positive signs, though. The EU, for instance, made the biggest jump from a target of a 40% cut to a 55% cut, based on 1990 levels. This video can not be played \"The target could have been more, but it\u2019s a good step in the right direction,\" Dr Hohne said.  He also applauded Nepal, Argentina and the UK, which aims to reduce emissions by 68% by the target date of 2030, based on 1990 levels. He held up the UK's governance of climate policy as  an example to the rest of the world . Britain has a Climate Change Act which sets ambitions into law, overseen by an independent body. The UK plans to be producing virtually no emissions by 2050 \u2013 the so-called Net Zero target. \u201cIt's a robust system that helps give longer term certainty,\" Dr Hohne said. \"It sends a strong signal to investors.\" The emissions proposals, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), reveal a productive rivalry between Japan and China over Net Zero.  Initially, Japan had no mid-century target. Then China proposed Net Zero by 2060, and Japan was stung into a counter-bid of Net Zero by 2050. China's proposal is yet to be formally confirmed to the UN.  The US has promised an ambitious submission under President Biden. And India \u2013 which long maintained that its poverty should exempt it from emissions cuts \u2013 is said to be pondering a target. Contradictory priorities  There is a difference, though, between what governments say and what they do. And many nations have tensions between contradictory priorities. Germany, for instance, is a member of the Powering Past Coal international alliance. Yet last year it opened a new coal-fired plant.  The UK is founder of that alliance but currently is permitting  a new coal mine to be dug  in the face of scientific and international criticism. It's also building a high-speed rail link that won't be carbon neutral until the back end of the century, and  it has a \u00a327bn roads programme . The UK is also slipping away from the strict targets imposed by its climate advisors.  Yet on the other hand, the UK is cutting out coal from power generation, investing heavily in renewables and mandating that no more petrol or diesel cars should be sold after 2030.   Mr Guterres said: \"Decision-makers must walk the talk. Long-term commitments must be matched by immediate actions to launch the decade of transformation that people and planet so desperately need.\" Aubrey Webson, chairman of the Association of Small Island States, said: \"We applaud the countries that have announced 2050 Net Zero pledges. \"But without credible 2030 pathways in their updated climate plans, those mid-century pledges are largely meaningless. This report confirms the shocking lack of urgency, and genuine action.\" Dr Hohne added: \"There is a gap between nations' stated plans and what's needed. There's also a gap between their pledges and their policies to deliver on those pledges. There is progress. It's slow, slow, slow.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Tackling climate change may emerge as a key goal for China when it unveils its future economic roadmap in Beijing on Friday.  The 14th five-year plan will be the blueprint for the country's short-term development. It's expected to outline stronger steps in limiting carbon from the world's biggest emitter. But concerns over the impact on the economy could stem the shift towards greener policies. Every five years since 1953, China has produced a planning document that sets out the government's targets for economic growth, social development and foreign policy over the next half decade.   Essentially, it is the political programme of the Chinese Communist Party and the plans are the framework that guide all policy decisions across government and industry. For decades, they have sparked the fossil-fuel based growth of the Chinese economy, leading to rapid growth in GDP (gross domestic product) and rising living standards.  The key question for the Chinese government is: can it keep the economy growing while limiting the warming gases that threaten the entire planet.  Last September, Chinese president Xi Jinping  surprised the world  by announcing that the country would reach net zero emissions by 2060 and would peak their carbon use before 2030.  Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. This new five-year plan will be a critical step forward on that road, and will give analysts a good indication as to how realistic those aims are. As well as outlining the steps for the next half decade, China is also looking longer term, sharing a series of objectives to 2035.  \"What you see is China trying to identify the technologies of the future,\" said Isobel Hilton, founder and senior advisor to  China Dialogue. \"These are low-carbon technologies, they are trying to move the economy up market, and to lay the foundations for China to become the supplier of low-carbon goods and technologies for a carbon constrained world.\" There will be a handful of key targets that analysts will use to judge the scale of ambition in the plan.  Chief among them will be the numbers for economy-wide growth, but also for how much carbon is used per unit of GDP.  There will also likely be targets for non-fossil fuel in the overall amount of energy consumed.  As important as the actual numbers will be the signals the plan sends to regional governments and industry. \"The key for the coming five years is to lay the groundwork by getting coal-dependent provinces and state-owned enterprises to diversify their economies and businesses and to stop investments in new fossil capacity,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the  Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air .   \"The other prerequisite is to set sufficiently ambitious targets for clean energy so that the sector can grow to the scale needed towards the end of the decade.\" China has promised that emissions will peak \"before 2030\" (marking the point at which greenhouse gas releases slowly begin to decline). But some experts believe the new five-year plan could see the country aim to reach that peak a bit earlier. However, this goal is not likely to make it into the document.  Traditionally, China likes to under promise and over deliver on climate issues. \"The likely targets for the share of non-fossil energy and for total energy consumption would leave space for emissions to increase almost 1% per year,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta. \"However, if the targets for clean energy are ambitious and overall energy demand growth proves to be slower than expected, it's entirely possible that emissions peak before 2025.\" Others are more bullish. \"Based on our analysis, China will be able to peak emissions by 2025,\" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace East Asia.   \"In our view, there is still a great potential for China to further enhance the peaking timeline from before 2030 to before 2025. And I think this is a view shared by most of the ministry analysis here in China.\" If that was to happen, it would be a major boost to efforts to keep global temperature rise well under 2C this century. The goals of 2C and 1.5C have long been regarded as gateways to \"dangerous\" levels of warming. The future consumption of coal in China is a critical issue for the world. The country uses around half of all the coal that's produced worldwide every year.  In 2020, it opened three quarters of the world's newly-funded coal-fired power stations.  So while the senior leaders in the central government want the country to move away from coal, the reality on the ground is that more coal-fired capacity is being built by regional governments keen to deliver jobs. \"It seems that the resolve to end the construction of new coal power plants isn't there,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta. \"So the most likely outcome is continued additions of new coal power plants but zero or negative growth in generation - meaning mounting overcapacity.\" Figures released  this week  showed that China rebounded rapidly from the economic slowdown associated with Covid-19, and finished the year with a larger tally of emissions than in 2019.  \"In 2020, the production of some of the key industrial outputs, such as steel, cement and aluminium, went beyond the level of 2019. And that is quite astonishing,\" said Li Shuo.   \"The Chinese economic recovery from the pandemic so far has been anything but green, so the upcoming five-year plan will therefore be a key text on how the country reconciles the old and the new.\" Others believe the shift to greener policies might now be slower than previously thought.  \"China might set some compulsory energy\/carbon intensity targets, but they are very likely still lower than the degree of GDP growth,\" said Zhang Shuwei, from the Draworld Energy Research Centre. \"I think it is possible that policymakers will set less ambitious targets on energy and coal consumption due to concerns about energy security,\" he said, speaking to Reuters.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The government has been hit by a double whammy of reports from MPs criticising its performance on climate change. The influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says ministers have \"no plan\" to meet climate change targets, two years after setting them in law. And the business committee says the vital UN climate conference scheduled for Glasgow in November will fail unless its goals are made clear.  The government says both reports are inaccurate and unfair. The PAC's report says ministers still don't have a coordinated strategy to realise the goal of removing almost all the carbon emissions from Britain by 2050.  The report notes that the government intends to publish what the MPs call a \"plethora\" of strategies setting out how it will reduce emissions in sectors ranging from transport to heating buildings.  But, it says, the policies aren't agreed yet. The MPs say the Treasury has changed its guidance to ensure departments place greater emphasis on the environmental impacts of their policies, but hasn't explained how this will work in practice. What's more, the MPs say, the government is not yet ensuring that its activities to reduce emissions in Britain are not simply transferring those emissions overseas - where so many of the carbon-intensive goods bought in Britain's shops are made. They also blame the government for failing to engage with the public.  Meg Hillier, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said: \"The government has set itself a huge test in committing the UK to a net zero economy by 2050 - but there is little sign that it understands how to get there. \" We must see a clear path plotted, with interim goals set and reached - it will not do to dump our emissions on poorer countries to hit UK targets.  \"Our new international trade deals, the levelling up agenda - all must fit in the plan to reach net zero. \"COP26 (the vital climate conference in Glasgow in November) is a few months away. The eyes of the world, its scientists and policymakers are on the UK - big promises full of fine words won't stand up.\" Meanwhile, the business committee says the government has provided no details so far about how success at the conference will be measured. Their report urges the prime minister to set out a clear list of ambitions for the summit, with a set of accompanying measures of success. It points out that the UK is currently guiding the summit to focus on key areas for change chosen by Britain. These are: But the committee says: \"We have concluded the current 'themes'-based approach is too broad, without clear measures for success. \"More focus needs to be given to the overriding necessity to agree deliverable policies that keep global temperature rises to as close to 1.5C as possible.\" A COP26 spokesperson said the government was making \"good progress\" but added \"there is no time to waste\".  \"The COP26 President, Alok Sharma, our teams, and the full weight of our diplomatic network are all working tirelessly to push for accelerated action from our partners around the world\" the spokesperson added.  Nick Mabey, from the think tank e3g, argues that multiple potential goals must be achieved - and he believes those goals should be debated publicly.  The aims would include:  \"This debate is up for grabs\" he told BBC News.  \"It should be a public debate because we're talking out how to change whole economies. A lot of the outcomes from Glasgow will be decided in the court of public opinion.\" Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: \"The lack of clarity on the vision for COP26 is seriously concerning. It is surely obvious that COP26 has to set the global economy on track to net zero emissions by mid-century.  \"This means brokering agreements that kick-start decarbonisation in various sectors and it also means Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak stepping up to the plate on finance to help the poorest nations.  \"Failure to sort this will fatally compromise COP26 - and the failure will lie squarely at the door of Downing St.\" Whatever global goals are eventually agreed, green groups warn the UK's negotiating position will be weakened unless it consistently cuts carbon domestically - it's currently slipping away from its long-term targets.  Mr Black added: \"Coming on the back of a Budget that didn't even try to get the Conservatives on track to their net zero target, the conclusion that they don't have a plan for reaching it, just months before the UK hosts a major UN climate summit for the first time, should stimulate some serious thinking right across Whitehall.\" A government spokeswoman said: \"It is nonsense to say the government does not have a plan when we have been leading the world in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by almost 44 per cent since 1990 and doing so faster than any other developed nation in recent years. \"Only this week in the Budget we built on the prime minister's Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution by encouraging private investment in green growth, and we are bringing forward bold proposals to cut emissions and create new jobs and industries across the whole country.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden has signed a series of executive orders designed to address climate change, including a new ban on some energy drilling. The orders aim to freeze new oil and gas leases on public lands and double offshore wind-produced energy by 2030. They are expected to meet stiff resistance from the energy industry and come as a sea change from Donald Trump, who cut environmental protections. \"Today is climate day at the White House,\" said Mr Biden on Wednesday. \"We have already waited too long,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House. \"And we can't wait any longer.\" Mr Biden said the US \"must lead\" a global response to the climate change crisis. \"Just like we need a unified national response to Covid-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis,\" he said. He added that neither challenge could be met by the US alone. The series of executive orders that Mr Biden signed on Wednesday establishes a White House office of domestic climate policy and announces a summit of leaders to be held in April on Earth Day. Climate change, under Mr Biden's plan, will become both a \"national security\" and \"foreign policy\" priority, officials say.   Mr Biden is also calling upon the US director of national intelligence to prepare an intelligence report on the security implications of climate change. Mr Biden is using his presidential powers to make climate change a central issue of his administration.  The executive orders and memorandum - which cannot go as far as congressional legislation in combating climate change - can be undone by future presidents, as he is currently doing to Mr Trump. According to a White House statement, Mr Biden is directing the Department of the Interior to pause oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands and water \"to the extent possible\" and to launch a review of existing energy leases. Mr Biden aims to conserve at least 30% of federal lands and oceans by 2030.  According to the New York Times, fossil fuel extraction on public lands accounts for almost a quarter of all US carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Biden's order does not specifically address private property owners or state-held public lands. He has signed more than three dozen executive orders in his first week in office, more than any of his predecessors. Critics note he  told ABC News  while campaigning last October that only a \"dictator\" would use executive orders excessively. \"We're a democracy,\" said Mr Biden, whose fellow Democrats now control all of Congress. \"We need consensus.\" Mr Biden's \"whole-of-government\" approach, the White House says, creates the position National Climate Advisor who will lead the office of Domestic Climate Policy at the White House. The presidential climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, conceded to reporters on Wednesday that it would make little difference in the global climate change fight if the US reduced its emissions to zero. \"He [Mr Biden] knows Paris [climate accord] alone is not enough,\" Mr Kerry said. \"Not when almost 90% of all of the planet's global emissions come from outside of US borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn't solved.\" This video can not be played The orders also direct federal agencies to prepare for the impact of climate change on their operations and improve access to information on the issue.  Mr Biden also directed agencies to only make \"evidence-based decisions guided by the best available science and data\". Pausing the extraction of oil and gas from federal lands is the Biden administration's tremulous first step onto the toes of the US oil and gas industry. Federal drilling is a key part of their output - providing around 22% of US oil production and 12% of gas, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API). The API is unhappy with the move, suggesting that any ban will lead to greater reliance on imports as the US economy recovers and needs more energy. But experts reject that argument, pointing out that drilling on public lands is likely to continue to expand even if a moratorium becomes a ban. That's because only half of applications for extraction approved between 2014 and 2019 have actually been used. Moving towards a ban on federal leases fulfils a campaign pledge and will reassure environmentalists that Joe Biden is the real deal when it comes to climate change. But making significant inroads into US carbon output will probably require legislation to be put before Congress. That will be the true test of the Biden climate commitment.  Mr Biden's critics say his climate initiatives will cut jobs as the US already suffers from record unemployment numbers because of the Covid-19 pandemic. He received a storm of criticism for last week's executive order halting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, that would have transported oil from Canada through the US. But the Biden White House is trying to get ahead of more criticism by addressing job creation.  \"When I think of climate change, I think of jobs,\" Mr Biden said, arguing that \"millions\" of Americans will be able to get jobs \"modernising our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure - to withstand the impacts of extreme climate\".  His plan directs federal agencies to \"identify new opportunities to spur innovation, commercialisation, and deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure\". It calls for the creation of a \"Civilian Climate Corps Initiative\" -  an initiative Biden officials say will \"put a new generation of Americans to work conserving and restoring public lands and waters\". During his four years in office, Mr Trump expanded the number of energy leases on environmentally sensitive national lands. The US achieved a level of energy independence in his term, becoming a net petroleum exporter, a milestone for which he claimed credit. Mr Trump also rolled back dozens of rules designed to ensure access to clean air and water, protections for wildlife, and the containment of dangerous chemicals and pollutants. Some of the changes, including one that sought to relax pollution rules affecting coal and gas-burning power plants, were overturned by federal courts. Mr Trump - who once called climate change a hoax - also took the US out of the Paris climate accords, whereas Mr Biden made moves to re-join the global agreement on his first day in office.

{"id":null,"body":"Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJ on Twitter This video can not be played He's one of Hollywood's biggest stars and, as Iron Man, is many moviegoers' idea of what a tech tycoon should look like.  But Robert Downey Jr has ambitions to play another role - that of an investor in technology to combat climate change. He tells Tech Tent he wants to step out of the make-believe world of his Avengers character and confront the real threat to the planet.  \"I'm not a kid any more. And I really want to find things that I think are dynamic and interesting and -  tell me if I'm wrong -  but isn't this the space to be catching the buzz right now?\" Downey is leading the Footprint Coalition, an investment fund that will try to spot fast-growing green technology businesses. He says much of his role will be about using his skills to tell a story about climate change, and the technology that can beat it, to his 100 million social media fans. \"I realised a few years ago that I'd amassed a pretty wide audience, I guess you call them followers nowadays. And it seemed like just posting more videos of me dancing with my alpaca wasn't really moving the conversation on this existential threat.\"  Speaking over a video link from his home in California, he says a key moment in his awakening to this threat  came in the wildfires in Malibu in 2018. \"I had my hoses out trying to help my neighbour not lose his house. You kind of go - this is not the rhythm that was going on in California in the 80s or the 90s.\"  The Footprint Coalition fund has already invested in a number of green businesses, including Cloud Paper - which makes toilet paper out of bamboo and has a mission to save a billion trees - and Ynsect, which turns mealworms into fertiliser and other products. The Hollywood star, who played Iron Man Tony Stark in 10 Marvel films, says he had originally thought about focusing on AI and robotics, like his fictional counterpart: \"I figured that was my strong suit, it was probably easiest to identify me with my namesake.\"  But  he says he is now looking at areas like transport,  energy  and consumer products. There are some real challenges for this mission.  Green technology investment is a crowded field and plenty of ideas that look attractive for a while end up struggling to make a financial return. Then there is the debate over climate change in the United States, with many politicians and voters not convinced the threat is real. He acknowledges this culture war, remembering that when the original Iron Man movie came out  \"all of my conservative friends said 'you really stuck it to those lefties' and all my liberal friends said 'you really showed them'\". But he insists he can find a way to reach across the divide. \"I think there's a way to appeal to my brothers and sisters in the heartland and my conservative friends, \" he says, \"rather than saying, you're wrong, you're crazy and you're bad.\" I tried to get Downey to talk about Elon Musk, seen by many of his admirers as the nearest thing to a real-world Tony Stark. But he was cautious. \"We have a very interesting history. I respect Elon a lot. But I have not really spoken to him in some while,\" he said.  But then he started talking about the importance of putting principles before personality, and of team spirit, \"rather than just thinking I will say and do as I feel\". The message seemed to be that Musk needed to be just a little more reflective before speaking out. What then, does Downey hope he can achieve with his fund? Well, first and foremost he's clear about the commercial imperative: \"I want people to have gotten a well above average return.\"  But he also hopes that some of the businesses he backs will produce technology that has a real impact on the world - \"and I would feel like I had some small part in that.\" Robert Downey Jr: Planet faces existential crisis Tech Tent: Police facial recognition was unlawful Tech Tent: Can the news industry trust Facebook?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC Energy and Envrionment Analyst  The government\u2019s climate change advisors have rapped ministers for allowing a new coal mine in Cumbria.  They say the site will increase global emissions and compromise the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budgets.  They warn the decision could undermine its leadership of the vital COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.  The new deep coking coal mine was agreed by Cumbria County Council and the government  previously said it did not want to intervene .  The rebuke comes in the form of a letter from the chair of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), Lord Deben, to the planning minister Robert Jenrick, which says: In response to the letter, a government spokesperson said the decision to allow the coal mine would not be reversed.  Cumbria councillors told BBC News there were no good planning grounds for them to refuse permission for the mine, near Whitehaven, and said it would help to diversify local employment prospects. The government\u2019s chief planning officer Joanna Averley defended Mr Jenrick\u2019s decision not to over-rule their consent for the mine. She told conference on planning policy arranged by the countryside charity CPRE that the decision was only a local issue. She was asked why, given the UK's policies on cutting carbon, Mr Jenrick had not exercised his powers to overrule Cumbria County Council's approval of the mine. Ms Averley said: \"The Secretary of State has to make a judgement based on whether the impacts of the scheme are more than local. \"And in this case, the decision was that this was a decision for local determination, and the application was approved by the local authority\u2026 a decision for local democracy.\" She said the planning department was playing its part in tackling climate change. Environmentalists have reacted with astonishment and disbelief, saying the carbon from burning coal is clearly a global concern. John Sauven, from Greenpeace, said: \"It\u2019s extraordinary that anyone still believes burning coal is only a local issue and has no global impacts. \"Let\u2019s hope China doesn\u2019t take the same view or the world will be toast. It certainly isn\u2019t setting the global leadership on climate that the prime minister says he's aspiring to.\" The critics point out that the UK has also helped drive an international group called  the Powering Past Coal Alliance. Supporters of the mine say it will supply coking coal for steel manufacture in the UK and that will save the need to import coal. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent @BBCJustinR on Twitter Fossil fuels have been the bedrock of US prosperity for more than a century.  The country's economy, security and society depend on them.  But in the few days since his inauguration, the new American president has gone to war against coal, oil and natural gas with a decisiveness that has caught everyone by surprise. This week I spoke to the man Joe Biden has tasked with drawing up his climate change battle plans - John Kerry. \"It is one of his top priorities, without any question whatsoever,\" Mr Kerry assured me. \"He'll make more progress on the issue than any previous president.\" That seriousness is reflected in his choice of John Kerry as his special envoy on climate. Mr Kerry was President Barack Obama's secretary of state and a key architect of the Paris climate change summit in 2015. In other words, he is someone deeply invested in tackling global warming, who understands current global climate diplomacy, and personally knows many of the key people the US will have to work with. In the handful of days the new president has been in office, he has already exceeded expectations. This video can not be played \"He is mobilising every department, every agency of the United States government to focus on climate and he is determined to try and restore America's credibility and reputation,\" explained Kerry.  Even some of the deepest green activists have been impressed.  \"There is a shock-and-awe feel to the barrage of actions,\" says veteran environmental campaigner Bill McKibben.  He believes the flurry of executive orders is designed to make an important point. The president wants to send \"a decisive signal about the end of one epoch and the beginning of another,\" says Mr McKibben. That signal is aimed at investors, he says. \"Fossil fuel, Biden is making clear, is not a safe bet, or even a good bet, for making real money.\" The oil industry has been left reeling. Share prices plunged, and Goldman Sachs warned of a drop in US crude supplies. \"The industry is aghast at these changes,\" one oil services company CEO told Bloomberg. \"They are more direct, more fierce and quicker than what folks expected.\" Biden and his team have been meticulous in casting the agenda as an exercise in job creation and economic stimulus in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. Mr Kerry repeats the now familiar \"build back better\" mantra to me.  \"If we're going to invest new money,\" he says, \"let's invest it in clean energy, invest it in clean jobs, invest it in those technologies and other things that will build the future, rather than simply being the prisoners of the past.\" Meanwhile, there have been a few modest sops to the fossil fuel industry.  Fracking won't stop, for example, although there will be tighter regulations, and Biden promised to put displaced fossil fuel workers to work sealing off the estimated one million leaking oil and gas wells. The plan to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes, and manufacture and install half a million new electric-vehicle charging stations, would also create millions of \"prevailing wage\" jobs. And the car industry will be delighted by the commitment to electrify the government's 650,000-strong fleet of vehicles. But, at the same time, President Biden has reiterated his desire to end all fossil fuel subsidies, ordered a ban on new oil and gas leases on federal land, and said a third of all federal lands must be reserved for conservation. He also ordered agencies to accelerate the authorising of renewables projects, as part of his effort to double wind capacity by 2030, and make the electricity sector zero-carbon by 2035. These initiatives don't depend on the Democrats wafer-thin majority in the Senate, Mr Kerry insisted. These are areas where the president already has authority. \"Now, that's not to say the president isn't going to try and get Congress to be part of this, of course he wants them. But this isn't going to be solely dependent on one source.\" For instance, Mr Biden plans to reinstate and strengthen Obama-era regulations, repealed by Trump, on the three largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions: vehicles, power plants and methane leaks from oil and gas wells.  The key, says Mr Kerry, is \"a massive shift\" in attitudes in the private sector. Companies are increasingly dealing with climate \"upfront and directly\", says Mr Kerry. US car makers are coming to accept that fuel economy standards have to rise, for example. Only this week General Motors announced plans to phase out petrol and diesel cars and trucks completely, and sell only vehicles with zero emissions by 2035. And some big oil and gas companies have acknowledged some of the curbs on emissions lifted by President Trump need to be reinstated.     But Mr Kerry knows there will be pushback from others in the fossil fuel industry and from the lawmakers who back it. Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator for West Virginia, is likely to be a particular thorn in the side of the Biden administration. He is to lead the Senate Energy Committee and was elected as a defender of his states coal industry. He famously campaigned with a TV ad that featured him using a hunting rifle to shoot a copy of one of Obama's climate change bills.  And, remember the Senate is split 50-50 with Vice-President Kamala Harris holding the casting vote. There will be more freedom of action on the international stage. Indeed, this may be where Joe Biden and John Kerry have their most transformative impact. Mr Kerry describes the Glasgow climate summit in November this year as \"the last best chance the world has to come together to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis\". It is a propitious time to be talking.  The cost of renewables has fallen dramatically since he led America's delegation to the Paris talks. Lots of countries are considering green investments as a way to stimulate their economies post-Covid.  And that's consistent with net zero by mid-century pledges that more than 100 countries - including the EU and China - have made recently. Mr Kerry knows America has to step carefully. \"I think that the fact that the United States has been absent for four years, requires us to approach this with a certain sensitivity and humility.\" The hope is, Mr Kerry implies, that aggressive action on the domestic front will give credibility to American efforts to encourage other nations to up their climate ambition. He said he and the rest of the administration will work hard with the UK government to ensure Glasgow is a success. \"I'm not going to contemplate anything else,\" he told me, \"because it would be a dramatic failure for mankind.\" Biden signs orders on 'existential' climate crisis Rejoining Paris sets ambitious climate goal for Biden Biggest global poll supports 'climate emergency' Why I fought for - or against - Keystone XL Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

There is positive news too, from Brazil, which \u2013 under US pressure \u2013 says its previous stance blocking climate talks was misunderstood. Monday's meetings may go some way to helping the UK focus its objectives for the November gathering.  Ministers were accused recently by MPs on the Business and Energy Select Committee of failing to set clear goals. The committee said the key areas identified by the UK for action - adaptation and resilience; nature based solutions; energy transitions; clean transport and switching the finance system to low-carbon investments - were too broad and \"without clear measures for success\".  It said more focus needed to be given to the \"overriding necessity\" of agreeing deliverable policies that keep global temperature rises to as close to 1.5C as possible. Nick Mabey, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC there was the potential to achieve multiple goals \u2013 including banning new coal power plants, ending banks' fossil fuel investment and supporting poorer nations to adapt - and that these should be debated publicly.  \u201cThis debate is up for grabs\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a public debate because we\u2019re talking out how to change whole economies. A lot of the outcomes from Glasgow will be decided in the court of public opinion.\u201d John Kerry's meetings with the UK politicians who will be running the COP26 summit may help bring some much-needed clarity to efforts on this side of the Atlantic.  But he will also be assessing just how much political capital Team Biden should invest in Team Boris.  So far, the messaging from the UK on what COP26 can realistically achieve has been muddled. If every country is going to put a new climate plan on the table before Glasgow, what's the actual point of the meeting? Mr Kerry will also be assessing how much diplomatic heavy lifting he should undertake on behalf of the Brits.  To give Glasgow a chance, both India and China will have to come up with significant advances on their current actions on carbon.  Others, including the Saudis and the Brazilians, will have to show flexibility. Kerry's involvement may be critical in delivering these outcomes.  But his impression of the British effort will also influence events back home. President Biden is organising a climate summit of world leaders for 22 April.  That meeting may become the bigger focus for the US if Kerry takes a dim view of UK's efforts on the COP.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent When Swiss energy companies made green electricity the default choice, huge numbers of consumers were happy to stick with it - even though it cost them more.  Four years after the switch, researchers found that around 80% of customers were still on green tariffs. This \"default effect\" happened partly because people didn't want the hassle of switching back to fossil fuels.  The authors say the idea could have a big impact on global emissions of CO2. In the study, the researchers looked at what happened when two Swiss energy suppliers changed the default electricity offering for their customers from a mixture of fuels to renewables only. This change affected around 234,000 private households and 9,000 businesses.  Before the switch, the numbers choosing to have green power were at around 3%. Afterwards, this rose to 80-90% of customers.  Residential consumers had to pay at least 3-8% more for their energy on the green tariff, while businesses saw their costs increase by up to 14% for energy used at night. Remarkably, these extra costs weren't enough to push consumers to change their tariffs back to ones with fossil fuels in the mix.  \"It is worth noting that even five years after the change, some 80% of the households are still sticking with green electricity,\" said co-author Dr Jennifer Gewinner, from ETH Zurich, a public research university in Switzerland's largest city. It was a similar story for small business customers. Several years after the switch, more than 70% were still on the more expensive green tariff. In the case of large companies, which had considerable choice in terms of which energy provider to go with, the vast majority stayed with green energy even though it was costing them around $2,300 extra per year.  The researchers believe that what they are observing is the surprising power of the default effect. This is a widely known phenomenon in different spheres, such as in organ donation, where laws have changed in many countries so that the people have to opt out if they don't want to donate after death.  A more mundane example is with double-sided printing, which has become the default in many offices to reduce wastage.  However, the authors of the Swiss study were surprised that this effect held up so well with energy, considering the greater costs involved.  The researchers believe that some of the reluctance to change is down to the human condition. \"You have to switch to the other cheaper tariff bills actively,\" said team leader Prof Andreas Diekmann, from ETH Zurich. \"You can do it by email or by a phone call, but many people just don't do it.\"  As well as people's inherent reluctance to tackle the paperwork involved in changing back to fossil fuels, there were other factors at play. \"People are a bit overwhelmed because it is a hard topic to actually feel competent to choose your own tariff,\" said Dr Gewinner. \"So if you help them and tell them we are all moving now to renewable energy, they feel okay. It was kind of what they wanted to do anyway. \"I think that's what makes default settings stick so much, because we understand that it's the recommended product, like the safe choice.\" One of the concerns that suppliers have about green energy tariffs is that customers will increase their overall use of electricity because they feel that it's clean and sustainable.  Over the six-year period of the study, the researchers found no evidence of greater consumption among those using renewable power. The authors also believe that moving to a green default setting would have a major impact on carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in countries with a high reliance on fossil fuels such as the US, China or Germany.  \"We made a simulation for Germany with data from 2018,\" explained Prof Diekmann. \"We figured out that when all companies would do it only for their private customers, the saving was 45 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. That's a big impact, equal to about 5% of all the CO2 emissions in Germany.\" But would this idea work if every energy supplier offered a green default - is there enough green energy to go around? \"The companies we work with, they were also afraid that they would need more renewable energy than they were able to support,\" said Dr Gewinner. \"But I think what our study does is help is to give you an estimate, of how many customers in your household sector and in your business sector will be likely to stick with green energy, and that will help the companies to actually calculate.\" Dr Gewinner believes the idea should be applicable all over the world. \"Changing people's attitudes and beliefs takes a lot of time,\" she told BBC News. \"But we can do this without changing people's belief structures, but just by being human.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The green, underwater meadows of Posidonia seagrass that surround the Balearic Islands are one of the world's most powerful, natural defences against climate change.  A hectare of this ancient, delicate plant can soak up 15 times more carbon dioxide every year than a similar sized piece of the Amazon rainforest. But this global treasure is now under extreme pressure from tourists, from development and ironically from climate change.  Posidonia oceanica is found all over the Mediterranean but the area between Mallorca and Formentera is of special interest, having been designated a world heritage site by Unesco over 20 years ago. Here you'll find around 55,000 hectares of the plant, which helps prevent coastal erosion, acts as a nursery for fish, but also plays a globally significant role in soaking up CO2. \"These seagrass meadows are the champion of carbon sequestration for the biosphere,\" said Prof Carlos Duarte, of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.  He's recently published  the first global scientific assessment of the environmental value of Unesco's marine world heritage sites . \"Posidonia acts as a very intensive sediment trap and captures carbon into these sediments. It is also very resistant to microbial degradation, so the carbon is not degraded when it's deposited on the sea floor. And much of that stays unaltered during decades to millennia.\" Depending on the water temperature, the species reproduces either sexually through flowering or asexually by cloning itself. This ability to clone itself means it can live an extremely long time. \"It's a remarkable plant not only in the capacity to sequester carbon, but also because it's one of the longest-lived organisms on the planet,\" said Prof Duarte. \"In the marine protected areas of Ibiza we documented one clone where we estimated that the seed that produced that clone was released into the seafloor and sprouted 200,000 years ago.\" \"A clone could be eternal, kind of,\" says Dr N\u00faria Marb\u00e0, from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Mallorca. \"If there are no damages that disturb it, it could last for forever - well maybe not forever but for an incredibly long time.\" But despite its ability to live almost infinitely, Posidonia is finding the modern world increasingly treacherous.  This vivid green carpet that extends under the seas in the Balearics faces an ongoing threat from boats dropping their anchors which crush, tear and destroy the meadows.  One study showed that between 2008 and 2012, Posidonia meadows in Formentera were reduced by 44% because of the impact of anchoring.  The plant also grows extremely slowly.  The damage caused by one yacht's anchor in a single day several years ago would take almost 1,000 years to restore.  Another threat comes from too many nutrients in the waters, caused by effluent released from water treatment sites across the islands.  But perhaps the biggest and most difficult challenge for Posidonia is climate change. \"Posidonia has an upper thermal limit of about 28C,\" says Dr Marb\u00e0. \"I think it's about half of the summers since 2000 that we have exceeded this temperature in the water in the Balearic Islands. \"It doesn't cause massive mortality. But it's excessive for the slow growth of the plant.\" So what can be done to help protect this amazingly powerful seagrass? Government action to protect Posidonia in the Balearics has been ramped up in recent years and public awareness of the importance of the species is rising.  But some researchers believe that putting a financial value on the carbon that's locked up by Posidonia could release the funds to save it.  \"As countries try and reach the goals of the Paris agreement, the forecast is that carbon credits are going to see a tenfold increase in value,\" said Prof Carlos Duarte.  \"Therefore, there's likely to be an increase in investment in habitats like Posidonia that can lock up carbon and generate these credits.\" This would be welcome news in Ibiza and Formentera. If the carbon that's already been sequestered by the seagrass increases in value, then it will pay to protect and even attempt to restore the Posidonia meadows.  But time and rising temperatures are the key challenge, as Dr N\u00faria Marb\u00e0 explains. \"The whole thing of planting seagrasses is that you have to do a massive effort at the beginning to start the process. And then you just wait for the plant itself to grow.  \"If we are in a hurry, at human timescales, it's impossible. \"But if we don't mind, and we can wait for a few centuries, it will be okay.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new approach to making jet fuel from food waste has the potential to massively reduce carbon emissions from flying, scientists say. Currently, most of the food scraps that are used for energy around the world are converted into methane gas. But researchers in the US have found a way of turning this waste into a type of paraffin that works in jet engines. The authors of the new study say the fuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 165% compared to fossil energy. This figure comes from the reduction in carbon emitted from airplanes plus the emissions that are avoided when food waste is diverted from landfill. The aviation industry worldwide is facing some difficult decisions about how to combine increased demand for flying with the need to rapidly cut emissions from the sector. In the US, airlines currently use around 21 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, with demand expected to double by the middle of the century. At the same time, they have committed to cutting CO2 by 50%. With the development of battery-powered airplanes for long haul flights a distant prospect at this point, much attention has focussed on replacing existing jet fuel with a sustainable alternative.  In fact the UK government has just  announced a \u00a315m competition  to encourage companies to develop jet fuel from household waste products. Current methods of making green jet fuel are based on a similar approach to making biodiesel for cars and heavy goods vehicles. It normally requires the use of virgin vegetable oils as well as waste fats, oil and grease to make the synthetic fuel. At present, it is more economical to convert these oils and wastes into diesel as opposed to jet fuel - which requires an extra step in the process, driving up costs.  Now, researchers say that they have developed an alternative method able to turn food waste, animal manure and waste water into a competitive jet hydrocarbon. Much of this material, termed wet-waste, is at present is turned into methane gas. However, the authors found a way of interrupting this process so it produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) instead of CH4.  The researchers were then able to use a form of catalytic conversion to upgrade the VFA to two different forms of sustainable paraffin. When the two forms were combined they were able to blend 70% of the mixture with regular jet fuel, while still meeting the extremely strict quality criteria that Federal authorities impose on aircraft fuels. \"There's exciting jet fuels that rely on burning trash and dry waste but this actually works for those wastes that have high water content, which we normally dispose of in landfill,\" said Derek Vardon, a senior research engineer at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the lead author on the study. \"Being able to show that you can take these volatile fatty acids, and that there's a really elegant, simple way to turn it into jet fuel - that's where I see the broader applicability of this one, and folks can continue to develop and refine it.\" The new fuel has a potentially significant impact on emissions as it not only limits the CO2 that comes from fossil sources used by the airlines, but it also gets rid of the methane that would bubble up from landfill if the waste food was just dumped.  Another major advantage is that this new fuel produces around 34% less soot than current standards. This is important because soot plays a key role in the formation of contrails from airplanes which adds a powerful warming effect to CO2 coming from the engines.  \"That's where we see the most potential for this technology is that you're preventing methane emissions, and dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of jet fuel. And you just can't do that with fossil fuels without getting into things like offsets,\" said Derek Vardon. The research team say they are planning to scale up the production of the new fuel and aim to have test flights with Southwest Airlines in 2023. Many environmental groups are sceptical about attempts to develop sustainable aviation fuels, believing that it amounts to green-washing. They argue that people should just fly less.  \"Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet,\" Derek Vardon says.  \"So we do want to definitely emphasise that reduction is the most important and most significant change you can make. But there's also pragmatism and need for aviation solutions now, so that's where we want to strike a balance as we need a basket of measures, to really start getting our carbon footprint down in a variety of sectors, including aviation.\" The  study has been published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

{"id":null,"body":"As Bangladesh celebrates 50 years of independence, Qasa Alom reflects on how the country his British-Bangladeshi family still calls home is being affected by climate change.  \"Can you turn the air-con on?\" I asked over and over but none of the grown-ups seemingly could hear me. \"It's so hot!\"  My mum shot me a look that suggested I would have more than the heat to worry about if I carried on moaning.  We had come to Bangladesh, the country of my ancestors, to see my grandparents, visit our village and, as I was constantly reminded, to \"learn about my roots\". As a child, I had spent my holidays roaming our lands - exploring the rice paddies with my younger brother, watching the farm hands tend to the cows and fishing in one of several fushkunis, or small lakes. It was a giant playground, full of joy, wonder and mischief.   But, that magic had started to wear off as a teen. One thing I remember vividly about that trip was the moment we were all told to get out of the car that was taking us from the airport to our village.  The road in front of us was completely under water. We were only about half an hour from our \"bari\" - village estate - but the journey was about to take an unexpected turn. We all climbed aboard a bamboo boat called a nowka, which then meandered down the murky green water for another two or three hours.  That was 15 years ago - the last time I visited our village. My mum, Ratna, and I talked about this story as we were going through some old photos, which captured 90s fashion, bad haircuts and our land - \"a sea of green\" - as she describes it. \"Your dad dreams of us retiring there, but that won't happen,\" my mum says. \"You, however, need to know what we have there, because that's your inheritance.\" My dad was raised in Bangladesh and regularly goes back to look after our estate, visit the school he set up and catch up with the local villagers. Ever since I was a child I've been told that he plans to pass the old family home to my brother, sister and me to look after - but that's not a topic we talk about much any more. It often ends in an awkward silence. Like many British Bangladeshis, my father feels duty-bound to help his village and the people he left behind. He has raised funds to build roads and a mosque, for farming equipment, and even to help people with medical bills.  Half the money he earned over the years working in Birmingham's restaurant trade has been sent back to invest in the land and the village, which was named after his great-great-grandfather.  Every summer he would suggest that I return with him to help, but I used to shrug and say, \"I don't have time.\"  My grandmother is the only member of the family who still lives in the bari now - one by one everyone else emigrated abroad, to the UK, Canada, and the United States.  But according to my father, \"Everything is falling into ruin. It's all going to pieces, nobody is living there and it's just becoming desolate.\"  My mum explains that generations of my father's family have lived there and that he has worked hard to build it up. \"He doesn't want it to be lost.\"  I've heard these words hundreds of times - but they've never really sunk in until now. Perhaps that's because I'm starting to appreciate my own history and lineage more. As British-Bangladeshis we are now more comfortable with our dual identity and want to find out more about the Bangladeshi part of ourselves.  Or perhaps I just wasn't ready in my late teens and early 20s. I was more interested in conquering the world, rather than preserving our little piece of it. I am now ready to help my father preserve our home. But there is something else to think about, and it's a far greater threat than neglect and apathy: climate change. Bangladesh is at the epicentre of the global climate crisis - 80% of the country is floodplain, and it is affected by floods, storms, riverbank erosions, cyclones and droughts. It ranks seventh on the Global Climate Risk Index of countries most affected by  extreme weather events . \"I jokingly say, Bangladesh is God's laboratory for natural disaster - we have all the disasters except volcanic eruption,\" says Prof Ainun Nishat, an environmental expert for the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research, who advises the Bangladeshi government. Prof Nishat believes that unless we start to control greenhouse gas emissions today, the situation will become unmanageable.   The Asian Network's Qasa Alom presents a  series of programmes marking Bangladesh at 50  The monsoon season from June - October sees incredible rainfall on the lush and fertile land, much of which flows away into one of the three huge rivers that run through the country like giant arteries: the Meghna, the Padma (the Ganges) and the Brahmaputra-Jamuna. Flooding has always taken place during monsoons - my mum remembers how 30 years ago, she and my dad took a nowka all the way to their front porch.  But the rainfall pattern is becoming more erratic, says Prof Nishat. \"It is raining when it is not supposed to rain and it is not raining when it is supposed to rain.\"   With rainfall fluctuating across the year, flash floods now occur more frequently and ferociously. And our region is particularly susceptible.  Like the majority of the 500,000 British-Bangladeshis, we come from Sylhet, in the north-eastern part of the country. It has high levels of rainfall and it's near the Haor Basin, a large saucer-shaped floodplain, 113 km wide, an area that is undergoing  persistent subsidence  - in some places it has sunk by 12m over the past 200 years, and it is still sinking.  In 2020 Sylhet was hit by huge flash floods that affected thousands of families, whose homes, belongings and livelihoods were swept away by this unforgiving natural disaster.  In fact over a quarter of the country was flooded that monsoon season. Nearly 1.3 million homes were damaged, hundreds of  thousands of people were marooned and hundreds died .  Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely-populated countries, and many people live in high-risk areas. That is because much of the higher land in Bangladesh has already been built on. At the time of Partition in 1947, Bangladesh - or East Pakistan as it was known then - had a population of about 40 million. Many of those houses were on higher ground, often built by the rich or left by the British.  As time has gone on though, the population in Bangladesh has increased to around 170 million people. Newer communities in developing areas are having to be built closer to floodplains and on lower ground, thus putting more people at risk.  The UN estimates that by 2050 about 20% more of Bangladesh  will be under water .  Vast areas of land, homes and memories are disappearing forever - including, potentially, my ancestral home. When I asked my parents how the floods have impacted them, my dad turned away. Not through apathy - but pain. My mother told me why. \"Over the years, I hear your dad talking to his mum. The rice crops and everything, it's getting less and less. During the monsoon season it gets flooded, so there's a loss.\" That came as a surprise to me. I'd seen flooding on the news and pictures of tin shacks being swept away, but our house is solid. It's on a raised platform and built on strong foundations. But there is a concern for the villagers around us, who depend on us and also on our food, crops and produce. \"The weather is getting more extreme,\" says Shipu Thakder, a friend of my dad's who helps us out in Sylhet. \"It is getting too hot. We don't understand when there will be rain and when there will be thunderstorms. Sunshine is difficult - we can't go outside without an umbrella or protection.\"  And now that the supply of water can't be relied upon, my father's land is getting drier, leading to village arguments about access to water.  About two-thirds of the country works in agriculture - rice, vegetables, fruit, fishing and farming. It's fertile land, but Prof Nishat is concerned about how a rise in temperature could affect crops and food production.  \"It is felt by the ecosystem and biodiversity, so it is going to challenge the productivity of food and that is where we are fighting and struggling,\" he says. \"We are afraid that bad days are ahead.\" The concerns about drought and flooding mean that it's harder to predict how much crop people will yield. That, along with the growing population in Bangladesh, means that it's becoming a priority for the government. Unlike in the past though, Prof Nishat thinks it's  something the country is well-equipped to deal with . \"Maybe 20, 30 years back we were dependent on external support for recovering from any natural disaster, but now the economic condition has improved, people's resilience has improved, and their capacity to withstand or manage natural disaster has improved. \"We are one of the most vulnerable countries, we admit, but possibly we are one of the most prepared. We suffered through these disasters regularly, so the people have their own resilience systems to cope with it.\"  That togetherness and spirit is something every Bangladeshi I have spoken to is very proud of. \"Our neighbours are good. We help each other,\" Shipu told me.  But while people in Bangladesh are doing their bit, it is vital that those of us in Bangladeshi diasporas all over the world to not forget the people who are still there. \"I'll come back with you next year,\" I told my dad in Bengali. He'd heard me say it a number of times before, but not like this. There was certainty in my voice and he could feel it. After the pandemic is over and it is safe to travel, I intend to keep my promise. The older I get, the more I understand the significance of my ties to my ancestral home, and the more I realise that the land that my father, my grandfather and so many generations before them were raised on, could be flooded and lost forever.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Rising imports in wealthy countries of coffee, cocoa and other products are a \"growing threat\" to forests in tropical regions according to a new study. Research shows consumer behaviour in the UK and other rich nations is responsible for the loss of almost 4 trees per person per year. Increasing numbers of trees are now being planted in the developed world, the authors say. But imports of products linked to deforestation undermine these efforts. This growing international trade is doing more harm than good for climate and for biodiversity say the researchers.  Among the world's forests, trees growing in tropical areas are said to be the most valuable in protecting species and limiting global heating.  Tropical forests are home to between 50-90% of all terrestrial plants and animals.  They are also critical for the climate, soaking up and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. But in the Amazon, central Africa, Indonesia and parts of Asia, growing numbers of trees have been cut down in recent decades so farmers can grow commodity crops like soybeans, and graze cattle for beef.  This new study looks at the global deforestation picture over the years between 2001 and 2015.  Using high-resolution forest maps and a global supply chain model, the researchers were able to compile a comprehensive and highly detailed account of how deforestation is being driven by consumer behaviour, especially in richer countries.  So while countries like the UK, Germany, China and India have all planted more trees at home in recent years, all are linked to rising deforestation outside their borders, particularly in tropical forests.  The researchers were able to be remarkably precise about the impacts of this trade. Cocoa consumption in Germany poses the highest risk to forests in Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana, in Tanzania it's the demand for sesame seeds among Japanese consumers that's a key driver.  It's not just the wealthier nations - demand in China is responsible for deforestation in Northern Laos as land is cleared for rubber plantations.  \"The imports of tropical deforestation-related commodities tend to be increasing, while the global deforestation rate was reported to be decreasing,\" said first author Nguyen Tien Hoang from the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto. \"Obtaining net forest gains domestically but expanding non-domestic deforestation footprints, especially in the tropics, might do more harm than good for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation,\" he told BBC News.  While consumers in India and China are responsible for the loss of  around one tree per person per year, this rises to almost four in the richer G7 group of countries.  \"This figure shows that the consumption of developed countries and the G7 in particular is destroying the world's forests, the planet's lung, and their biodiversity,\" said Adeline Favrel, from  France Nature Environment , who was not involved with the study.  \"Our consumption is not destroying our forests, but the forests of other countries, particularly the tropical forest, which is the richest in terms of biodiversity. The main culprits are our consumption of wood, meat, palm oil and soya.\" Dealing with the problem though is not easy. The authors say that continued economic growth is not the answer. As richer countries saw their economies grow dramatically over the period of the study, their dependence on tropical forests has increased.  \"Rich countries should recognize their role in deforestation as a major consumer of forest-risk goods,\" said Audrey Changoe, an expert on trade at  Friends of the Earth Europe . \"Governments need to adopt regulatory measures to oblige companies to assess and mitigate deforestation risks. The EU is now working on an accountability framework to address environmental harms and human rights by business. This must include liability for the harm caused by companies and access to courts for victims of human rights violations and environmental crimes.\" The authors argue that paying poorer countries for environmental services has already cut deforestation rates and helped people out of poverty. They are calling for an expansion and increase of these long-term solutions.  The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Kevin Keane BBC Scotland's environment correspondent I drive a diesel car, eat meat and just a few months ago had a gas boiler installed in my house, that's quite an admission for an environment correspondent who reports on climate change. The problem is that greener options are financially out of reach for me and - it seems - most Scots. That is something I have been investigating for  BBC Scotland's Disclosure . We commissioned a survey of 1,009 Scots, conducted by Savanta ComRes,  which suggests price is putting many people off making greener lifestyle choices. Of the people who indicated that they had considered buying an electric vehicle in the past year, 71% said they had not bought one because of the cost. Price was a factor too when it came to switching from gas and oil home heating to greener alternatives such as heat pumps. In that question, 64% of those who had considered the switch said the cost had put them off. Both these changes and many others will be necessary over the next 25 years if Scotland is to meet its targets for reducing emissions. But Dr Sarah Ivory from the University of Edinburgh, who has studied climate-related behaviour change, believes it will difficult to bring them about. She says: \"We're all a little bit sick of hearing about how bad it is, hearing that something needs to happen and really not knowing how to act. \"We have people say, 'why should we change now?'. I think the answer to that is, if we don't change now, we really are on a pathway to some catastrophic changes in our climate.\" Those catastrophic changes are not just being felt in faraway countries. Experts told Disclosure that Scotland would see more wildfires, droughts and impacts from rising sea levels. But our survey suggests most people are unaware of the changes that are coming. Only 16% expected more wildfires, despite Scotland already seeing a dramatic rise in these. Even fewer, just 13%, thought increasing droughts would be a problem, despite more than 100,000 private water supplies being at risk. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service says it has seen a 30% rise in wildfires since 2010 and believes a similar rise is likely in the next decade. In May 2019 fire spread across 22 square miles of peatland in the Flow Country in Sutherland. Area Commander Bruce Farquharson said: \"If things don't change in relation to where the climate is differing and to human behaviour then the fires we will see in the UK will be similar to those that are being seen in Portugal right now.   \"If we look at the fire behaviour that we see in Portugal, unfortunately that will lead to loss of life.\" In 2017, dozens were killed in their cars while trying to flee a wildfire in Portugal. It often takes hundreds of firefighters to bring them under control. Our investigation suggests there are clear barriers preventing people making environmentally-beneficial lifestyle changes.  About 29% of respondents had considered buying an electric vehicle (EV) in the past year but most had been put off by the price which is still more than for a similar petrol or diesel car. EV driver Elinor Chalmers has had her vehicle since 2015 and is a passionate advocate of them. She says: \"It's something completely new and it does require quite a habit change.  \"We are used to driving up to the petrol station, standing there fuelling up. But most of our cars are sitting doing nothing the majority of the time so your car can be fuelling while it's stationary.\" Arguably the individual action with the greatest short-term benefit is reducing the amount of meat we eat. That's because the greenhouse gas generated by livestock rearing, methane, is up to 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. But unlike CO2, which hangs around for centuries, methane is relatively short-lived, lasting just decades. Government advisers have suggested we should cut our meat consumption by a quarter over the next 10 years. But our survey suggests a reluctance, with 30% saying they would not follow the advice. Most (79%) said it was because they liked eating meat while 39% said they did not believe eating meat was bad for the environment. In Scotland, researchers also forecast that half of the country's private water supplies are at risk of regularly running dry because of drought. That would affect more than 100,000 people in places such as the north east and Dumfries and Galloway.   New boreholes are now being drilled in areas which have never run dry before. Dr Mike Rivington, from the James Hutton Institute, says: \"It's not unusual to have localised areas suffering drought. What is increasing is the probability of that happening more often.  \"We look at years like 2018, which was a fairly exceptional year, where (drought) was much more widespread across the country.  \"We're going to see a lot more of years like 2018. In fact that's going to become the norm rather than the exception.\" Before the pandemic, school strikes were being staged right across Scotland with young people protesting that governments were not doing enough to tackle climate change. The idea came from the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg who held a weekly vigil outside the country's parliament. But our poll suggests only 32% of people have been influenced by the protests to make lifestyle changes for the benefit of the planet. And 29% believe the actions of individuals have only a minor impact, or no impact at all, on tackling the issue.

{"id":null,"body":"By Pablo Uchoa BBC World Service Ronah Masika remembers when she could still see the snowy caps of the Rwenzori mountains, a Unesco World Heritage site on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The view was stunning every time she travelled from her home in Kasese town to the Ugandan capital, Kampala - and it was not even that long ago. But now she cannot even catch a glimpse of the ice because the glacier is receding. And it is not only the view that has changed. Ms Masika recalls her grandmother used to grow beans to feed her family, and they would last until a new crop was ready to be harvested. \"Now I and other people find it difficult to sustain ourselves with what we plant at home, because everything gets destroyed by floods or drought. It's either too much drought or too much rain. \"It's making me uncomfortable, thinking of how the next generation is going to survive this horrible situation,\" says Ms Masika, who now works on a project to mitigate the impact of the shifting environment. Climate change is affecting the Rwenzori Mountains in different ways. The most visible is the rapid loss of the ice field, which shrunk from 6.5 sq km in 1906 to less than one sq km in 2003, and could completely disappear before the end of this decade, research shows. In 2012, forest fires reached altitudes above 4,000m, which would have been inconceivable in the past, devastating vegetation that controlled the flow of the rivers downstream. Since then, the communities living at the foot of the Rwenzori have suffered some of the most destructive floods the area has ever seen, coupled with a pattern of less frequent but heavier rainfall. In May last year, five local rivers burst their banks after heavy rains. The waters came down the mountain carrying large boulders, sweeping away houses and schools and razing the entire town of Kalembe to the ground. Around 25,000 houses were destroyed and 173,000 people were affected. While science may provide an explanation for these events, the local Bakonzo culture has another way of framing them - according to their beliefs, they happen because the gods are angry. \"The Bakonzo have a very strong attachment to the snow and the water,\" says Simon Musasizi, a programme manager at the Cross-Cultural Foundation of Uganda (CCFU).   \"They believe that their god, Kithasamba, lives in the snow, and that the snow is actually the frozen sperm of their god.\" The name Rwenzori comes from rwe nzururu, which means \"place of snow\" in the Bakonzo language. There are 30 gods associated with different natural resources living on the mountain, according to Bakonzo cosmology.  But deforestation and rapid population growth around the sacred mountain, as well as the melting glacier, are changing things.  During last year's floods, the water submerged hot springs and washed away the vegetation around a waterfall that was used as a place for rituals. Since then, spiritual leaders have been unable to perform those ceremonies. Other spiritual sites are getting eroded or filled up with silt and the destruction of the vegetation has weakened the banks in many areas. All this is threatening centuries-old rituals. \"Most likely, many of these customs will gradually became rare or they won't happen any more, because everything is shifting,\" Mr Musasizi says. The Bakonzo community is made up of around one million people living on both sides of the border between Uganda and DR Congo, and their heritage could be lost as a result of climate change. \"The consequences of climate change are particularly acute at the tropics,\" says Richard Taylor, a geographer at University College London, who has led research on the Rwenzori Mountains. \"One or two degrees of warming at the Equator has a much bigger impact on climate and water budgets than one or two degrees of warming in London, Paris or New York.\" The intensification of weather patterns observed in the mountains is happening throughout the tropics. Prof Taylor, who co-led expeditions from 2003 to 2007 to measure the changes in the Rwenzori glaciers, says the loss of ice fields in the tropics is a tell-tale signal of global warming. Restoring and protecting areas affected by climate change is key to preserving cultural heritage too. As part of a project to do this, Mr Musasizi says there is an agreement with the community about which trees are going to be planted to best reinforce the riverbanks, including bamboos and native trees. Ms Masika, whose job it is to liaise with the local people, says the community already had answers for some of the problems. \"For example, they know what type of vegetation should be planted at what level on the mountain. They know which ones are strong enough to be planted along the river to stop the floods. \"They know they are supposed to plant along the riverbank because it is food to the water god. And when the water god is fine, he doesn't cause floods.  \"Climate change is understood in the culture, and they have some suggestions that can help us mitigate this situation.\" The lessons are being shared with other institutions working to protect cultural heritage from climate change, mainly in East and North Africa and the Middle East. Finding solutions that highlight the close link between the Bakonzo culture and the natural environment has been a surprise for Ms Masika, who grew up in a Christian household where little was said about it. Now one of her favourite spots is the Embugha or Rwagimba hot springs, that the Bakonzo believe have physical and spiritual healing powers, particularly for skin diseases. \"When we started this project, my skin was itching all over. But every time I visited the springs, I made sure I bathed in the water,\" she said. \"It's so hot when you sit there, you feel like you're burning. Then you go to the river, which is just next to the hot pool, and the water is so cold you feel like you're freezing.  \"By the time you leave, your body is feeling light, and since then I no longer feel itchy.\"  How Africa will be affected by climate change Six African heritage sites under threat from climate change Uganda country profile Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"Bitcoin mining in China is so carbon intensive that it could threaten the country's emissions reduction targets, according to new research.  China wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060.  The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found.   China accounts for more than 75% of bitcoin mining around the world, researchers said.   The study was written by academics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Cornell University and the University of Surrey. It was published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.  \"Without appropriate interventions and feasible policies, the intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort taken place in the country,\" it warned.  Some rural areas in China are popular among bitcoin miners, mainly due to the cheaper electricity prices and undeveloped land to house the servers.  Miners play a dual role, effectively auditing bitcoin transactions in exchange for the opportunity to acquire the digital currency. The process requires enormous computing power, and in turn consumes huge amounts of energy.    Already, bitcoin-related emissions in China exceed the total emissions of the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016.   This video can not be played By 2024, China's bitcoin operations will exceed the total energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia, and would rank 12th among nations.   At its peak, it could account for about 5.41% of China's electricity generation emissions.   The researchers said a carbon tax would be relatively ineffective for bitcoin, and suggested \"site regulation\" policies instead.  The researchers said the \"attractive financial incentive of bitcoin mining\" has caused an arms race in dedicated mining hardware The price of the cryptocurrency surged during the pandemic, rising from $7,000 last April to pass $60,000 in March before hitting a period of volatility.    Bitcoin's price increase was pushed higher by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment, including electric carmaker Tesla. The Covid-19 pandemic also likely played a part, with more people shopping online and moving further away from physical currencies. Critics have long charged that in addition to its environmental impact, its main use is as a financial speculation tool rather than as a currency.   They also worry that it is prone to market manipulation by a few large players.

{"id":null,"body":"New Zealand is to become the world's first country to bring in a law forcing its financial firms to report on the effects of climate change. The country wants to be carbon neutral by 2050 and says the financial sector needs to play its part. Banks, insurers and fund managers can do this by knowing the environmental effect of their investments, says its Climate Change Minister James Shaw. Legislation is expected to receive its first reading this week.  \"This law will bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial and business decision making,\" said Mr Shaw. About 200 of the country's biggest companies and several foreign firms that have assets of more than NZ$1bn ($703m, \u00a3511m) will come under the legislation. \"Becoming the first country in the world to introduce a law like this means we have an opportunity to show real leadership and pave the way for other countries to make climate-related disclosures mandatory,\" said New Zealand's Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister David Clark. The law will force financial firms to assess not only their own investments, but also to evaluate the companies they are lending money to, in terms of their environmental impact. \"While some businesses have started publishing reports about how climate change may affect their business, strategies and financial position, there is still a long way to go,\" added Mr Clark. This video can not be played Once the law is passed, companies will have to start reporting on climate change impact in 2023. Banks have come under increasing pressure to step up efforts to help fight climate change. Last week, the Duke of Cambridge urged banks to \"invest in nature\" to help fight global climate change. Speaking at an IMF and World Bank meeting, Prince William said protecting nature continued to play only a small part in combating global warming. \"We must invest in nature, through reforestation, sustainable agriculture and supporting healthy oceans\u2026 because doing so is one of the most cost effective and impactful ways of tackling climate change,\" he said. In the US, more than 300 businesses and investors, including tech giant Apple, called on the Biden administration to set an ambitious climate-change goal on Tuesday. This would cut US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.

{"id":null,"body":"China and the US say they are committed to working together and with other countries on tackling climate change.  It comes after several meetings between Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry in Shanghai last week.  They both agreed on further specific actions to reduce emissions, a joint statement on Sunday confirmed.  US President Joe Biden is holding a virtual climate summit this week, which China says it is looking forward to.  However it is not yet known if Chinese President Xi Jinping will join the world leaders who have pledged to attend.  \"The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,\"  the statement said .  It added that both nations will continue to discuss \"concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach\". Both nations also agreed to help developing countries finance a switch to low-carbon energy. Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for environmental group Greenpeace, described the statement as \"positive\".  \"It sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue (China and the United States) will co-operate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume, \" Mr Li told Reuters news agency.  The joint statement - issued symbolically at a round table - will relieve anyone concerned about the planet. It simply won't be possible to stabilise climate change unless the superpower super-polluters pull much harder. A recent report said China, for instance,  must close down 588 coal-fired power plants  to meet its climate pledges. Is China heading in the right direction on coal? No - its regional governors have been building even more coal plants to stimulate the economy. One outcome from the US-China meeting is the acknowledgement that finance flows should be channelled to low-carbon projects, not high carbon. Both sides have also promised plans for reducing their own emissions further. President Biden will unveil his proposals at or before the US summit this coming week.  President Xi is playing coy over whether he'll attend the summit. Instead he may announce tighter Chinese targets at the Boao Forum - a Chinese forum for business and government leaders - also this week. And don't forget: all other nations need to commit to tackling the climate - not just the superpowers.  Mr Kerry's trip to China is the first high-level visit by a member of the Biden administration since the new US president took office. However US and Chinese officials  met for talks in Alaska last month . Ahead of his trip to Shanghai, Mr Kerry told CNN that China's co-operation was \"absolutely critical\" to battle the climate crisis.  \"Yes, we have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone,\" he said.  Climate scientists warn that global warming must not rise more than 2C above pre-industrial levels - in fact the aim should be well below this with an increasingly ambitious 1.5C goal, to avoid the worst of climate breakdown. Central to the Paris Agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are targets intended to cut emissions.  NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. According to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action,  China's NDC rating is \"highly insufficient\"  and \"are not at all consistent with holding warming to below 2C\". China has pledged to peak its emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (that means cutting out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels but still allowing farm emissions of methane - another planet-heating gas). However, China is currently running 1,058 coal plants - more than half the world's capacity. The US, meanwhile, has the worst NDC rating of  \"critically insufficient\"  on the Climate Action Tracker. The US was absent from climate negotiations during President Donald Trump's term of office and it is now being urged to cut emissions to between 57% and 63% below 2005 levels this decade.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tom Heap BBC Radio 4's 39 Ways to Save the Planet Around the world, there are teams of people who are working to track down and destroy hidden sources of greenhouse gases - stopping them from harming the planet. Some of the gases, which are used in refrigeration, have many times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. On the outskirts of Guatemala City, \u00c1ngel Toledo runs a waste disposal company dealing with metal, plastic and glass. For the last three years they've also started dealing with refrigerant gases - which contribute to climate change. He siphons the gases from household appliances like fridges into refrigerant recovery machines.  They are then transferred to a huge tank that's taken to be destroyed once it's full.  It's a tangible measure of what \u00c1ngel has helped save. \"I feel fulfilled,\" he says. \"I've had this plant for 16 years working with plastic and glass and other waste  but I've been working on refrigerants for the last three years.  \"I feel it's like a dream, helping the environment. Avoiding these gases from reaching the atmosphere. It's an ecstasy being able to help the planet through this work. It's very important for me.\"  But not everyone is disposing of refrigerant canisters or fridges in the right way.  \"Unfortunately, you see that a lot and one of the biggest challenges we face is having to change the common practice. You see the cylinders on the street,\" he explains. \"They vent the gases as they're dealing with equipment or the cylinders and it's going to the atmosphere.\"  \u00c1ngel is part of a chain of people working to stop these gases causing damage to the planet. Teams from Tradewater, a company funded through climate offsetting, are working around the world negotiating with governments, private companies and individuals to find ways to find, secure and destroy the gases safely.  Once they get an agreement from the owner and local authorities, they take them somewhere they can be disposed of safely. These teams are jokingly referred to as \"ghostbusters\", because of the way their cinematic counterparts gathered up troublesome phantoms and stored them together in large \"containment units\". They doggedly track, trap and destroy rogue gases before they can escape and cause climate havoc. They're also sometimes known as \"chill hunters\". Almost all fridges and air conditioning units use a gas to transfer the chill or warmth within the unit. This gas is a great insulator - handy in a fridge but not in the atmosphere.  Over the last century, the most commonly used gases were CFC (chlorofluorocarbons) and HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbons). But when it was discovered they were causing a hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s, they were banned under the Montreal Protocol.  Some of them were also potent greenhouse gases: one, called R12 - a CFC - had a global warming potential almost 10,000 times that of CO2. A single 30lb canister of this gas contained the equivalent of 131 tonnes of CO2 in terms of it global warming potential. This is the equivalent of the average UK car driving just over a million kilometres. HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) were brought in as replacements, and helped save the ozone layer. But some of the early HFCs were, like the ozone-harming gases banned under the Montreal Protocol, potent greenhouse gases. Current legal fridge gases are better, but still have global warming potentials many times greater than carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that by phasing out HFCs, global warming could be reduced by around half a degree Celsius. Tradewater searches for gas tanks, intact fridges or industrial chillers often stored in old warehouses and waste disposal sites. Sometimes, however, the team arrives too late, finding only punctured tanks, corroded pipes and gases long released.  Maria Guti\u00e9rrez, Tradewater's director of international programmes, says: \"These gases are all over the place - in refrigeration equipment that's in use or not, but also in huge stockpiles of unused material that were purchased and never used, or confiscated when imported illegally into a country many years ago.\" These chemicals exist in a legal grey area, so stocks are often hidden as owners may hope to sell them in the future. Sometimes the scrap iron value of the canister alone means that the gas is vented and the metal sold on.  Global warming gases are also found in some fridges, freezers and air-conditioners in the UK - which should be disposed of responsibly. It's another reason why fly tipping can be so harmful. Tradewater says its global gas recoveries have already prevented the equivalent of 4-5 million tonnes of CO2 from reaching the atmosphere, but the work continues. Ms Guti\u00e9rrez says: \"We are only scratching the surface. There is so much more out there.\" The Chill Hunters are featured in  39 Ways to Save the Planet  on BBC Sounds and on BBC Radio 4 at 13:45 BST for the next two weeks.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Josephs Business reporter, BBC News The global shipping industry is calling on the world's governments to tax its carbon emissions.  Groups that represent more than 90% of the global fleet say the measure is needed to tackle climate change. \"A global solution is the only one that's going to work\", Guy Platten, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping told the BBC. The tax would incentivise ship owners to invest in new technology, he said. The shipping sector is one of the big carbon emitters, and is responsible for more than 2% of global emissions. If the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany. While shipping was not directly included in the Paris climate change agreement the sector has been making efforts to clean up its act. A recognition of this need to change led the UN agency that regulates shipping, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), to target cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However, this plan was criticised by environment groups which said the plan  will see emissions from ships grow for several decades . There have been other efforts, including the development of a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping technology. But now the industry wants all governments to impose \"a price on carbon\" to give ship owners a commercial imperative to change, says Mr Platten. A worldwide carbon pricing scheme would need to be negotiated through the IMO. A group led by the ICS has asked the agency for discussions to start \"as soon as possible and before 2023, with a view to taking some decisions\".  As well as the ICS, the call has backing from the shipowner's organisation Bimco, Cruise Lines International Association and the World Shipping Council. The timeline is a recognition that this will be a complex process that is likely to take at least two years to enact. Such a tax will almost certainly lead to extra costs for shipping companies that will be passed on to their customers, which could be problematic for export dependent economies. Mr Platten said: \"We need to reassure governments who, perhaps from the more remote places, feel that their supply chains might be disrupted because shipping becomes more expensive\". That is likely to filter through to consumers. The boss of the world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, recently told the BBC the cost of tackling climate change in the industry would \" translate into something like six cents per pair of sneakers \". Amid concern that rising sea levels threaten the future of their countries, the Pacific nations of the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands are calling on the IMO to introduce a $100 per tonne levy on greenhouse gas emissions.  This is seen as ambitious by some and it's not clear what shape a carbon tax on the shipping industry will take. It would also have a bigger impact on smaller shipping companies who are likely to struggle more with the costs of new, cleaner technology. Mr Platten said: \"It's complex, it needs to be a global solution, and not regional solutions, as has been mooted by various places around the world. So that's why we're calling for this discussion to start now.\" Discussions could begin at an IMO meeting in June. Professor Alan McKinnon of Germany's Kuehne Logistics University says these long-debated market-based measures are needed to cut shipping emissions.  \"They would certainly give all the maritime stakeholders a much stronger financial incentive to decarbonise the sector,\" he said. The call for a new tax comes on the eve of a major climate change event that is being hosted by the US:  the Leaders Summit on Climate Change . Speaking on Tuesday, President Biden's special envoy for climate change John Kerry said: \"The US is committing to work with countries in the IMO to adopt the goal of achieving net zero emissions from international shipping by no later than 2050.\" This follows a broader commitment by the world's biggest economy to use  trade as a tool to tackle climate change . That influence could be key to getting the international agreement a new carbon tax on shipping will need.  Professor McKinnon, one of the authors of a 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: \"Although the proportion of the world's fleet of cargo vessels registered in the US is relatively small, the country can help to drive down the carbon intensity of global shipping in other ways.\" \"In addition to the US exerting political influence as a key member of the IMO, its ports and businesses could require vessels to meet higher environmental standards. \"The US government's pursuit of net zero shipping by 2050 now makes the IMO's 2018 target of a 50% reduction in emissions between 2008 and 2050 look distinctly unambitious\" he added.

{"id":null,"body":"The EU has adopted ambitious new targets to curb climate change, with a pledge to make them legally binding.  Under a new law agreed between member states and the EU Parliament, the bloc will cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The EU parliament had pushed for a higher target of a 60% reduction. \"Our political commitment to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 is now also a legal one,\" said EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. \"The Climate Law sets the EU on a green path for a generation.\" The deal comes ahead of a virtual summit of world leaders later this week, where the US is expected to announce its own climate targets for 2030. US President Joe Biden, who will lead the meeting, rejoined the Paris climate agreement in his first day in office  and has previously committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The UK, meanwhile, announced radical plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035  earlier this week, although environmentalists warn that the government has consistently failed to achieve previous targets set by its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). The EU Climate Law was agreed in the early hours of Wednesday after months of talks. It sets a limit on the levels of CO2 removal that can count towards the 2030 target, to ensure that states actively lower emissions rather than removing them from the atmosphere through forests, for example. A 15-member independent council will also be established to advise the EU on climate measures and targets. The EU Commission will announce a package of climate laws in June to support the plans. The target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 was initially announced by EU leaders in December but there had been pressure from the EU Parliament and environmental groups for the law to go even further. Previous EU targets had called for a 40% cut. EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmerman described the agreement as \"a landmark moment for the EU and a strong signal to the world\".  However, Greens MEP Michael Bloss tweeted that the climate law was a \"big disappointment\", adding: \"We fought hard but achieved little\". In September the  EU Commission set out its blueprint  for reaching the 55% target by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures. The targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played US President Joe Biden has told a major summit that we are in a \"decisive decade\" for tackling climate change. The US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030.  This new target, which was unveiled at a virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubles their previous promise. But the leaders of India and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, made no new commitments. \"Scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade - this is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis,\" President Biden said at the summit's opening address. \"We must try to keep the Earth's temperature to an increase of 1.5C. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\" He said there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change. Referring to America's new carbon-cutting pledge, President Biden added: \"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting. \"The US isn't waiting, we are resolving to take action.\" Your device may not support this visualisation Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was testifying before Congress on Thursday, challenged world leaders to do more on the climate crisis. \"Unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight,\" she said. \"How long do you honestly believe that people in power will get away with it?\" The UK is playing a critical role this year as president of the crucial COP26 later this year. The government is tasked with achieving agreement in Glasgow when world leaders meet there in November. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in ebullient form on his virtual conference address. He assured global leaders that tackling climate change was \"not bunny-hugging\". This video can not be played At the summit, Mr Johnson called President Biden's announcement about cutting US greenhouse gas emissions \"game-changing\". \"We can do this together across the world. It's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100bn commitment they already made in 2009,\" he said. Climate has been the central focus of the Biden administration's first few months in office.  As well as re-joining the Paris climate pact and organising Thursday's summit, the Biden team has been working on a strong pledge to convince the world that they mean business. The fact that President Biden is prepared to go beyond a 50% cut will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners.  \"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands,\" said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defense Fund. \"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the US into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\" But the new pledge will mean major changes to the American way of life. Coal will have to disappear from the electricity mix, while gas guzzling cars and trucks will have to go electric. Others stepping up with new promises included Canada, Japan and South Korea. But Canada's promise to limit carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 came in for immediate criticism from campaigners. \"Canada's new 2030 emissions reduction target is stronger than its previous commitment, but it falls short of what is needed to avoid dangerous levels of warming,\" said Helen Mountford from the World Resources Institute. \"Canada's efforts to deliver real action on the ground are welcome, like placing a price on carbon pollution, but the country should aim for a much more ambitious goal than what it put forward today.\" Meanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshide Suga said the country was \"ready to demonstrate its leadership\" on the climate. Mr Suga said that Japan would reduce emissions by 46% in 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Previously, the country had pledged only a 26% cut in emissions. South Korea also pledged a new target and said they would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas. But China made no new pledges but hinted that coal, which is set to grow again as the economy recovers from Covid, will be tackled in the next few years. \"We will strictly control the coal-fired power generation projects,\" the country's President Xi Jinping told the gathering. \"We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period.\" However, that's likely to be after 2026. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China will be responsible for around half the growth in coal around the world this year, as economies recover from Covid. India's Prime Minister Modi stressed that his country's per capita emissions were 60% lower than the global average. He said that lifestyle changes should play a bigger role in limiting climate change. However he made no new promises on curbing emissions. President Biden's team is also urging countries that have been slow to embrace action on climate change - such as Australia and Brazil - to raise their ambition. Brazil and Australia's sceptical approach to the issue had found favour in the Trump White House. But that's no longer the case. Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs Science correspondent, BBC News The nations of the world are due to meet at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, to try to agree far-reaching action on climate change. They're under pressure to improve on landmark commitments they made six years ago in Paris. The Paris Agreement united almost all the world's nations - for the first time - in a single agreement on cutting the greenhouse gas emissions which are causing global warming. Adopted by nearly 200 countries in the French capital on 12 December 2015, it came into force  on 4 November 2016 . Some of the key discussions in Glasgow will be about whether countries are doing what they promised in Paris. When it was signed, governments admitted the targets set would not limit global warming to 1.5C. Because of this, they agreed to update them by 2020 (COP26 was delayed for a year because of covid).  All countries should have submitted new targets for reducing emissions ahead of Glasgow, but many have not come up with improved commitments and some major economies have no net zero target in place. The Paris Agreement restated a commitment made in 2009 that the world's richer countries should provide $100bn annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with the effects of climate change, and build greener economies. But in 2019 only $79.6bn was raised. What's more, a recent expert report for the United Nations  said the goal would not be reached until 2023  - even though a new and more ambitious target is supposed to be set for 2025. For many countries, this is the biggest issue to resolve at COP26 - and the very poorest are demanding action. The plan is to create a \"climate-neutral\" world by the middle of the century. That means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and compensating for any remaining emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, using natural or artificial processes. The average global temperature has already risen by about 1.1C, and scientists say action must be stepped up if we are to have any chance of curbing dangerous climate change. They also say limiting the temperature rise to no more that 1.5C - rather than letting it go to 2C - would help millions of people avoid the dangerous impacts of extreme weather, and prevent sea level rises that would see small island states sink beneath the waves.

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter The world's glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate, according to a comprehensive new study.  A French-led team assessed the behaviour of nearly all documented ice streams on the planet. The researchers found them to have lost almost 270 billion tonnes of ice a year over the opening two decades of the 21st Century.  The meltwater produced now accounts for about a fifth of global sea-level rise,  the scientists tell Nature journal . The numbers involved are quite hard to imagine, so team member Robert McNabb, from the universities of Ulster and Oslo, uses an analogy.  \"Over the last 20 years, we've seen that glaciers have lost about 267 gigatonnes (Gt) per year. So, if we take that amount of water and we divide it up across the island of Ireland, that's enough to cover all of Ireland in 3m of water each year,\" he says on  this week's edition of Science In Action  on the BBC World Service. \"And the total loss is accelerating. It's growing by about 48Gt\/yr, per decade.\" The worldwide inventory of glaciers contains 217,175 ice streams.  Some are smaller than a football pitch; others can rival in area a mid-sized country like the UK. What nearly all have in common is that they are thinning and retreating in a changing climate, either through stronger melting in warmer air or because the patterns of snowfall that feed the glaciers have shifted. The research team, led by Romain Hugonnet from the University of Toulouse, France, used as its primary source of data the imagery acquired by Nasa's Terra satellite, which was launched in 1999. Immense computing power was brought to bear on the process of interpreting these pictures and pulling out the changes in the glaciers' elevation, volume and mass up to 2019. The team believes its approach has hammered down the uncertainties in its results to perhaps less than 5% overall. That's in large part because every single glacier examined in the study is represented based on the same methodology. \"This new study is a major advance as we get a high spatial resolution and, at the same time, it also provides the temporal change over the two decades directly based on satellite data, which is novel,\" explained co-author Matthias Huss from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. \"This data-set has been validated with an immense amount of additional, independent measurements and is highly accurate so that the uncertainties of previous studies are strongly reduced.\" A group led from Leeds University published  its own assessment of glacier ice loss in January  in the journal The Cryosphere. It arrived at very similar numbers. It reported a 289Gt\/yr average loss over the period 2000-2019, with a 52Gt\/yr\/decade acceleration. An 8% difference. Leeds professor Andy Shepherd told BBC News: \"Glacier melting accounts for a quarter of Earth's ice loss over the satellite era, and the changes taking place are disrupting water supplies for billions of people downstream - especially in years of drought when meltwater becomes a critical source.  \"Although the rate of glacier melting has increased steadily, the pace has been dwarfed by the accelerating ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland, and they remain our primary concern for future sea-level rise.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter It's an unassuming rock, greenish in colour, and just over 4cm in its longest dimension. And yet this little piece of sandstone holds important clues to all our futures. It was recovered from muds in the deep ocean, far off the coast of modern-day West Antarctica.  The scientists who found it say it shouldn't really have been there. It's what's called a dropstone, a piece of ice-rafted debris.  It was scraped off the White Continent by a glacier, carried a certain distance in this flowing ice, and then exported and discarded offshore by an iceberg. What's remarkable about this particular cobble is that researchers can say where it originated.  Using the latest \"geo-fingerprinting\" techniques, they've established with strong confidence that it comes from the Ellsworth Mountains - some 1,300km from where the rock was pulled up from the floor of the Amundsen Sea by a drilling ship. The conundrum is that the Ellsworths - the tallest range in Antarctica - are in the far-interior of the continent, and it's highly unlikely a rock like this could survive being ferried so far under an ice sheet to get to the coast to be then despatched in a large, frozen, floating block. \"In our view of observations of that material, it would not withstand a great deal of transport, with deposition and then re-transport over multiple steps of a cycle. And, furthermore, it probably would not hold up well to a great deal of interaction between the ice sheet and the bedrock. It would be destroyed and disaggregated,\" Christine Siddoway, professor of geology at Colorado College, US, told BBC News. So how did it get to travel so far? The answer is in the age of the deposits collected by the Joides Resolution ship on its International Ocean Discovery Program  (IODP) \"Expedition 379\"  cruise in 2019.  They're mid-Pliocene in the geologists' timeline. That's about three million years ago.  The mid-Pliocene is a fascinating period in Earth history because of its strong echoes of today. It was the last time the atmosphere carried the same concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide - at over 400 parts per million. Temperatures back then were significantly warmer, perhaps by 2-3 degrees globally, and sea-levels were also higher, possibly by as much as 10-20m above the modern ocean surface. And this is where our small green sandstone rock comes into the story. Those mid-Pliocene sea-levels imply the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, or at least significant parts of it, had melted away - and that in its place was a large open seaway. This is hard to imagine when you look at maps of Antarctica today; we view its ice covering as a continuous solid mass. But take the ice off and you are essentially left with a great archipelago - a series of major islands. It explains how the cobble could travel so far.  Glacier ice at the Ellsworth Mountains picked it up and then produced an iceberg locally to float it more than a thousand kilometres across the open seaway to drop it in the place Expedition 379 eventually recovered it. \"Our findings do confirm that the ice sheet can disappear fairly rapidly and also that it can re-establish itself fairly readily,\" explained Prof Siddoway. \"We read from very detailed records - that we're striving to make even more detailed - that the ice sheet has collapsed back in a considerable extent, specifically in the middle Pliocene. \"This is an interval, if we read current literature from climate modellers, that we may be entering... The climate conditions of the Pliocene are what we are expected to enter. And if warming continues at the rate that it is now, we may stay there.\" No-one expects the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to collapse anytime soon, but the little sandstone cobble is a warning, scientists believe, of the conditions we could eventually re-create if we don't soon get on top of the climate crisis. Prof Siddoway presented details of  the IODP Expedition 379 research  at this week's  European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly . Normally held in Vienna, Austria, #vEGU21 has been convened online this year because of Covid restrictions.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent Young activists are breathing new life into the long-running debate over climate justice - the framing of global warming as an ethical issue rather than a purely environmental one.  When world leaders took to the (virtual) stage at President Biden's climate summit, they were given a gentle telling off by 19-year-old climate activist, Xiye Bastida. \"Solutions must be aligned with the fact that climate justice is social justice,\" she said, echoing the words of Greta Thunberg. The Mexican-born teenager is among a new generation of climate activists drawing attention to environmental and social injustices they say are blighting lives worldwide. Her words cut through the noise in a video that has been viewed more than a quarter of a million times. If you missed my speech, you can watch it here \ud83d\udc9a  https:\/\/t.co\/UpO4mO1x2m Harriet Lamb of the climate solutions charity, Ashden, says people have been talking about the problem of climate injustice for decades but young activists are giving it new momentum. \"It has undoubtedly changed the agenda,\" she says. For her, climate justice is about making sure we address historic injustices over emissions, including the carbon footprint of the wealthy, whose lifestyles have contributed most to global warming. At the same time, climate change is predominantly impacting those who've done the least to contribute to carbon pollution and who have the least resources to deal with it because they are living below the poverty line. The starkest inequalities are seen in the poorest countries of the world, where people leaving only a tiny carbon footprint are at the front line of climate chaos, from floods to ruined crops. But even in wealthy countries like the UK, there are warnings of carbon inequality. Amy Norman, a researcher at the think-tank, The Social Market Foundation, says politicians need to level with voters on what the transition to net zero will mean for the way we live. There's potential for a public and political backlash over issues of unfairness, she says, which could damage trust and ultimately the wider transition to net zero (removing as many emissions as we produce). \"This is an entire economical, societal shift and transition that we need to make,\" she says.  \"Politicians need to have the public on board and bringing them alongside - if you're hitting lower incomes where it hurts with their finances you're going to lose support quickly and especially if that's seen to be unfair.\" Anyone driving around in a clapped-out car they rely on for the school run might well wonder how to afford a shiny new electric car.  And if you live in a tower block, where would you even charge one? And those dreading a hefty bill to fix a faulty boiler will be shuddering at the thought of an expensive heat pump. These are some of the issues politicians must wrestle with as they work out how to deliver on their promises for curbing emissions. Amy Norman says there needs to be a package of support for low-income households to help meet the costs of electric vehicles and funding for local authorities to install public charging points. Issues of climate justice are thrown into even sharper relief when looking at emissions through a global lens. Studies show that the combined emissions of the richest 1% of the global population account for more than the poorest 50%. The global south will bear the brunt of economic impacts from rising temperatures, with those on lower incomes more vulnerable to the likes of floods, drought and extreme heat. In Nigeria, for instance, the poorest 20% of people are 50% more likely to be affected by a flood, 130% more likely to be affected by a drought, and 80% more likely to be affected by a heat wave than the average Nigerian. And in Bangladesh, India, and Honduras, poor people are losing two to three times more than the wealthy when hit by a flood or storm.  One recent study  found that enacting policies to fight climate change will push an additional 50 million people into poverty by 2030. Study researcher, Dr Bjoern Soergel of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, says the drive towards net zero could mean higher prices for food and energy, which will have a greater impact on the poor. But he says there is a \"win-win\" situation by which you can protect the climate and reduce extreme poverty. This would involve carbon pricing - essentially a carbon tax on polluting fossil fuels - with governments re-distributing some of the profits on a per capita basis. Richer countries would then need to give a fraction of the money to the countries where people live in extreme poverty. \"Making [climate policies] in an equitable way really needs to be at the core of climate action first of all because the currently rich industrialised countries are responsible for the large majority of emissions in the past,\" he says.  \"They have contributed most to the issue so far. But also they have the biggest means to tackle the problem both in terms of financial resources and technology.\" This video can not be played Harriet Lamb says there is a danger that measures designed to encourage cleaner, greener living might exacerbate existing socio-economic divisions and derail the drive towards a net zero world. \"We have to have exactly the right policies that tackle climate inequalities and social inequalities at the same time because the two are absolutely intertwined,\" she says. And while people have been talking about the problem of climate injustice for decades, young activists are now giving it new momentum. \"This is not David against Goliath, which is the clich\u00e9 representation of so much of civil society, this is Goliath slugging it out against Goliath,\" she says. \"I would not say the battle is yet won for those pushing for the dramatic action we need to ensure we do see climate justice but I would say the scales are beginning to tip.\" Follow Helen  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Recent climate change promises by major nations will bring the world a fraction closer to the prospect of a more stable climate, analysis suggests. The  Climate Action Tracker  group says the new targets have reduced projected warming by the end of century by 0.2C. The forecast now stands at 2.4C \u2013 a small improvement, but higher than the 1.5C threshold nations are aiming for under the Paris climate agreement. Final calculations by researchers of the emissions gap in 2030 between Paris pledges and a 1.5C pathway show it\u2019s been narrowed by 11-14%.   The biggest prospective contributors to reducing emissions are the US, EU countries, China and Japan. The researchers noted that Canada announced a new target at President Biden\u2019s recent climate summit while South Africa is consulting on an increased target. Argentina has increased its target, and the UK has a stronger target of a 78% emissions cut by 2035. The research comes with a warning about the potential gap between aspiration and achievement. Based on current national policies the estimated warming is 2.9C - that's nearly twice what governments agreed it should be when they sealed the big climate deal in Paris in 2015. Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, one of the partner organisations for the report, said: \u201cIt is clear the Paris Agreement is driving change, spurring governments into adopting stronger targets. \u201cBut there is still some way to go, especially given that most governments don\u2019t yet have policies in place to meet their pledges.\u201d  He said Brazil, for instance, had brought forward its climate neutrality goal, but changed the baseline from which it was calculated - actually making its 2030 target weaker. Some governments also continue to build coal-fired power plants, and to increase the usage of natural gas for electricity. The report also identifies a major problem with automobiles, as drivers steer towards larger, less efficient SUVs. Niklas H\u00f6hne of New Climate Institute, the second report partner, said: \u201cThe wave towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions is unstoppable. The long-term intentions are good.  \u201cBut only if all governments flip into emergency mode and propose and implement more short-term action, global emissions can still be halved in the next 10 years as required by the Paris Agreement.\u201d And the changes required by society won\u2019t all be driven by national governments. The local council in Holland\u2019s Amsterdam, for instance, has just imposed a ban on adverts for cheap flights and gas-guzzling SUVs on the city\u2019s Metro.  In New York, a major advertising agency, Forsman & Bodenfors, says it won\u2019t work with oil and gas companies, in a move that one executive compared to the refusal of an earlier generation of ad managers to back the tobacco industry. Oil and gas firms are now finding it harder to recruit new graduates for a career in fossil fuels.  And in many economies pressure is building for major corporations to first declare their carbon footprint, then reduce it.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Chief environment correspondent Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says. Methane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas. It persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2. The report says \"urgent steps\" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal. This agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. The 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to \"dangerous\" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change. The report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere  reached record highs last year . This happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity. The good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost. Methane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere) In addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body. The recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep). Drew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact. \"So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected\", he said. \"We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years.\" Scientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to \"dangerous\" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target. The new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year. The main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%. One of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across.  In the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes\/hr of CO2.  On an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier. The Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts. Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes. Many of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale. But the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls \"massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies\". The waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world. Improving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate. This video can not be played There is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls \"healthier diets\" - those with a lower meat and dairy content. If a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims. Because of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts. This attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible. Prof Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: \"The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.\" Follow Justin  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. It's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in a  special report . The sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035.  The IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies. The report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road to  COP26 in Glasgow , when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice.  In that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour. The energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures.  Models designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around \u00a3100 more than the \u00a32,000 standard gas boiler. This will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions. But climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited. So most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000.  They're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible. There are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too. But the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult.  To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century.  To keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050.  The IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth.  By 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%. The authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air.  Crucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas. However, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale.  It will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world.  Home heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK. The IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen. This will not be an easy shift for the building sector. \"It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,\" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank.  \"The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments.\" The IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present. To meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020.  This equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years. By 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040.  While the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP. \"The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director.  \"The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation.\"  One issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).  There are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity.  The IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production. \"Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,\" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people. \"Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.\" The IEA Net Zero by 2050 report can be found  here .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The world's major nations have taken further significant steps to help limit climate change. G7 environment ministers have agreed that they will deliver climate targets in line with limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. That's far more ambitious than the previous 2C maximum. Ministers also agreed to stop direct funding of coal-fired power stations in poorer nations by the end of 2021.  There's wriggle room in the statement, but the decision will send a clear message to development banks that still fund coal power in poor countries. There's also an important commitment to safeguarding 30% of land for nature by 2030 to boost wildlife and help soak up carbon emissions. Environment ministers from the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, France, Italy and Germany took part in the virtual G7 meeting, which is one of a series leading to the  leaders' gathering in Cornwall  in June.  The online meeting was led by the UK, and a government source told BBC News: \"We're pretty encouraged by the outcomes.\"  The decisions that have been taken are an important stepping-stone on the road towards the vital global climate summit in Glasgow in November called  COP26 . The move to keep their policies in line with 1.5C implies much faster action to cut emissions by 2030, rather than by mid-century. Nick Mabey from the climate think tank E3G told BBC News: \"This is looking good. \"It puts the burden on any fossil fuel development now to prove that it's 1.5C compatible.\" The ministers are said to have been heavily influenced by  a recent report from the rich nations' energy think tank, the IEA .  The study said that if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, then there could be no new coal, oil or gas development from now on.  The G7 ministers agreed much more cash was needed to help fast-growing economies such as India and Indonesia to get clean technology. This decision will be pushed forward at the G7 Finance ministers' meeting on 4 June.  The  communique  issued by the ministers at the end of the meeting said: \"We will phase out new direct government support for carbon-intensive international fossil fuel energy.\" This is expected to mean coal and oil. But there's no date for enactment of the policy, with Japan arguing against strong strictures against coal. The UK hopes Japan will bend further on this by the Glasgow conference in November. Another statement in communique said: \"We commit to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by end of 2021.\" The UK Environment Secretary George Eustice told a news conference that the G7 would work towards ending unregulated fishing - and strive to improve marine biodiversity in international waters. The US special climate envoy John Kerry said the meeting showed a unique sense of urgency - and unity. He said the G7 had understood the need to make sure some groups of people aren't left behind by the coming low-carbon revolution. The ministers agreed that the world should move towards zero emission vehicles. The G7 were joined by India, Australia, South Africa and South Korea who have guest status at the meeting.   The elephant not in the room was China. The UK's tactic is not to blame the world's biggest carbon emitter, but to lay down a challenge.  One UK source said: \"It's a question of us saying 'this is what we are doing to protect the planet - what are you going to do to protect yourselves and the planet?'\". UK sources were keen to emphasise that with President Biden as US leader, western democracies had now re-taken charge of the international agenda. The G7 nations now need to prove they have policies to back their intentions. The UK government told BBC News it supported the IEA report, but wouldn't be revoking recent North Sea drilling licences. Ministers have also declined to halt the proposed Cumbria coal mine, and they're pushing ahead with a \u00a327bn roads programme and the HS2 rail project - both of which will increase emissions.

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter Will it be next, and if so, when? These are questions often asked about Larsen C, a huge ice shelf, twice the size of Wales, attached to the eastern edge of the Antarctic Peninsula. A dozen or so smaller floating ice platforms, mostly to the north, have either disintegrated or substantially retreated in recent decades, as the region's climate has warmed.     So it's with interest that we learn from new research that Larsen C may be more resilient than we dared hope. Scientists have been drilling through the ice shelf, and just in front, to get at sediments that record past ice behaviour. And what these investigations tell us is that Larsen C has maintained integrity throughout the last 10,000 years. It's had a couple of phases of retreat in previous warm spells - roughly 9,000 and 4,000 years ago - but it's never collapsed like its northern cousins. \"It's clearly a robust ice shelf; it's hung in there for a long time,\" says study leader Dr James Smith from the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK. \"So with that resilience we could potentially prevent a collapse if we curb carbon emissions and get a good grip on atmospheric warming. But what I would say is that Larsen C is probably as vulnerable as it's ever been in terms of the last 10,000 years because it's likely at the thinnest it's ever been over that period,\" he told BBC News. Larsen C is an amalgam of ice from many glaciers that flow off the Peninsula into the Weddell Sea. There's a point - it's called the grounding line - where this protruding mass becomes buoyant and lifts up to form a wide, 300m-thick, floating wedge. Occasionally it will spit out icebergs, some on a gargantuan scale, such as the trillion-tonne A68 block that broke off in 2017 and later grabbed social media attention as  it wandered up into the South Atlantic. Larsen C's importance - and it's the same for all ice shelves - is that it buttresses the glaciers behind. Remove the shelf and ice streams to the rear flow faster, putting more mass into the ocean to further raise sea-levels. This was documented in those northern collapses, the most spectacular of which was next-door Larsen B, which shattered in 2002. The feeding glaciers accelerated. Larsen C bounds some 300-400km of coastline, so it's critical it stays intact for as long as possible as we further warm the planet in the decades ahead. This video can not be played Dr Smith and colleagues can be confident about what's happened in the past because of what they see in the layers of mud pulled up in the drill cores.  Sequences that hold compacted sediments speak to times when heavy, grounded ice must have been present. Sections where there was more organic material - the remains of marine organisms - record times when the ice retreated to some degree to allow seawater to circulate in the cavity under the floating front of the shelf. \"What was immediately obvious is that there was no evidence for major retreat or collapse,\" explains Dr Smith. \"[At ice shelves where there have been past collapses], you generally see a distinctive, open marine type of sediment that reflects open-ocean productivity. So this is phytoplankton and other marine microfossils. It's a big marine signal. But we didn't see that under Larsen C, so we're fairly certain there was no significant retreat or collapse.\" Going back to those opening questions: How long can Larsen C resist today's climate change challenge? The pressures are rising. For example, there's evidence now that the ice platform is increasingly being confronted by  warm winds that come down off the peninsula mountains  and melt its surface.  Prof Adrian Luckman will head down to Larsen C shortly to study its suture zones. These are the areas where the feeding glaciers are glued together to make the continuous shelf structure. The nature of the ice in these zones works to dampen the activity of cracks and so helps keep the shelf intact.   \"Predicting the future evolution of Larsen C is tricky,\" the Swansea University researcher says.  \"It sits in the cold Weddell Sea, so is not subject to the same rapid ocean warming seen elsewhere in Antarctica such as at Thwaites Glacier (in the west of the continent), and there is some evidence of ice shelf thickening rather than thinning.  \"On the other hand, Larsen C has progressively lost area during the satellite era - quite spectacularly during the 1980s and in 2017 - so that trend is likely to continue.\" The investigation of Larsen C's history is being published  in the journal Geology .

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor It's becoming more likely that a key global temperature limit will be reached in one of the next five years. A major study says by 2025 there's a 40% chance of at least one year being 1.5C hotter than the pre-industrial level. That's the lower of two temperature limits set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conclusion comes in a report published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).  The analysis is based on modelling by the UK Met Office and climate researchers in 10 countries including the US and China. In the last decade, it was estimated that the chance of any one year reaching the 1.5C threshold was only 20%. This new assessment puts that risk at 40%. Leon Hermanson, a senior Met Office scientist, told BBC News that comparing projected temperatures with those of 1850-1900 shows a clear rise. \"What it means is that we're approaching 1.5C - we're not there yet but we're getting close,\" he said. \"Time is running out for the strong action which we need now.\" The researchers point out that even if one of the next five years is 1.5C above the pre-industrial level, it'll be a temporary situation. Natural variability will mean the following few years may be slightly cooler and it could be another decade or two or more before the 1.5C limit is crossed permanently. The Paris Agreement established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C - and that's understood to mean over a long period rather than a single year.  According to Dr Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, \"the 1.5C in the Met Office announcement should not be confused with the 1.5C limit in the Paris Agreement\". \"The Paris targets refer to global warming - that is, the temperature increase of our planet once we smooth out year-to-year variations,\" he explained. \"A single year hitting 1.5C therefore doesn't mean the Paris limits are breached, but is nevertheless very bad news. \"It tells us once again that climate action to date is wholly insufficient and emissions need to be reduced urgently to zero to halt global warming.\" A landmark report by the UN climate panel in 2018 highlighted how the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. At the moment, projections suggest that even with recent pledges to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, the world is on course to heat up by up to 3C. The WMO's secretary-general, Prof Petteri Taalas, said the results of the new research were \"more than mere statistics\". \"This study shows - with a high level of scientific skill - that we are getting measurably and inexorably closer to the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,\" he explained. \"It is yet another wake up call that the world needs to fast-track commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality.\" Prof Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, told me that if the new forecast is proved right \"it does not mean that we have exceeded the Paris Agreement limit\". He points out that two individual months in 2016 saw a rise of 1.5C. This video can not be played \"As the climate warms, we'll get more months above 1.5C, then a sequence of them, then a whole year on average above 1.5 and then two or three years and then virtually every year,\" Prof Hawkins said. He also stresses that 1.5C is \"not a magic number that we've got to avoid\". \"It's not a sudden cliff edge, it's more like a slope that we're already on and, as the climate warms, the effects get worse and worse. \"We have to set a line in the sand to try to limit the temperature rise but we clearly need to recognise that we're seeing the effects of climate change already in the UK and around the world and those effects will continue to become more severe.\" The report comes in the approach to the COP26 summit on climate change, due to be held in Glasgow in November. The summit aims to raise ambition among world leaders on tackling the climate crisis. Follow David  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Global meteorological agencies agree that 2020 was a scorching year but they are divided on just where it ranks in the temperature records.  For Nasa, last year is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the warmest year.  Others, including the UK Met Office, believe it is second in the rankings dating back to the 19th Century.  But all the agencies reporting on Thursday agree that last 12 months are part of the warmest decade on record.  Just last week,  a report from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service  indicated that 2020 was tied with 2016 as the warmest year. Thursday's reports, from five key agencies around the world, show some dissent from this view, but all agree 2020 is in the top three. Nasa says 2020 is tied with 2016, while the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) and the UK Met Office have it second.  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has 2020 as the third warmest year.  The differences between the datasets are all within the margin of error, says the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which has consolidated the information from the agencies.  Source: WMO Taken together they show the global temperature is now around 1.2C above the 1850-1900 average, sometimes referred to as  the \"pre-industrial figure\" .  Ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities are the key element in driving up temperatures, say researchers.  While greenhouse gases  declined by around 7% globally last year  in response to the coronavirus shutdowns, this wasn't enough to affect temperatures. \"Because we haven't stopped doing that and, in fact, we continue to do that even with the pandemic, we're still putting our foot on the accelerator of climate change,\" Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York, told BBC News. \"We anticipate that the planet will continue to warm at the rate that it has and maybe even accelerate, unless we get those emissions down, and that's a big task.\" By Jonathan Amos, Science Correspondent Every January we get a report on the surface temperature of Earth in the previous year. Or rather, we get several. Different leading agencies around the globe do their own particular analysis. Ignore the funny labels like HadCRUT5 by the UK Met Office or JRA-55 used by the Japan Meteorological Agency - what lies behind these names are some sophisticated statistical approaches.  All the different temperature curves you see above are built on broadly the same raw data. This comes from millions of temperature measurements gathered by instruments on land and at sea (some ship-borne, some floating). What sets the individual analyses apart is the different ways the agencies go about handling quirks and biases in the data. For example, how do you incorporate the Arctic where we have relatively few measurements but where we know temperatures are rising faster than most other places?  The different agencies have their own ways to extrapolate from nearby instrument stations to gauge what's going on in this region. It's best not to get hung up on the small differences between the curves. Look instead at the trend. On this they all absolutely agree 100%. Planet Earth is warming. One of the key concerns in the data from 2020 is the way that the warming driven by humans is over-compensating for natural events that help reduce temperatures. \"The exceptional heat of 2020 is despite a La Ni\u00f1a event, which has a temporary cooling effect,\" said WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas. \"It is remarkable that temperatures in 2020 were virtually on a par with 2016, when we saw one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o warming events on record. This is a clear indication that the global signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as the force of nature.\" The fact that 2020 saw global temperatures rising 1.2C above the pre-industrial figure is a growing concern.  Under the Paris Agreement, governments have promised to make their best efforts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C this century, as  scientists have shown it makes a massive difference  to keeping our planet habitable.  In fact, if you just look at the temperatures on land, 2020 breached this limit.  According to Noaa, the globally-averaged land surface temperature for 2020 was 1.59C above the 20th Century average. This is the highest among all years in Noaa's 141-year record and surpasses the previous record set in 2016 by 0.05C. \"2020 has proved to be another notable year in the global climate record,\" observed Dr Colin Morice, senior scientist in the Met Office's climate monitoring team. \"With all datasets showing a continued rise in global average temperature, the latest figures take the world one step closer to the limits stipulated by the Paris Agreement.\" Another factor that helped drive up temperatures in 2020 was air pollution, or the lack of it. Global lockdowns meant fewer cars on the roads and airplanes in the sky. As the dirty air disappeared this allowed more sunlight to hit the Earth's surface, boosting temperatures.  \"The cars that we drive produce a lot of what's called NOx, nitrogen oxides. And those went down pretty much everywhere, where we had restrictions,\" said Dr Schmidt.  \"And what that has done is it has removed a little bit of that reflective air pollution. Our calculations and (those of) others suggest that that may have warmed the climate just a little bit over the last year.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales environment correspondent This video can not be played Reservoirs in the Brecon Beacons are increasingly being polluted by landslides that have been described as a \"dramatic\" warning of climate change. Extreme rainfall in recent years has led to an increase in the slips, the National Trust and Welsh Water said. They result in the water being supplied to 1.5 million homes and businesses turning \"ros\u00e9\" pink and requiring additional treatment. Thousands of trees are being planted to stabilise land near the reservoirs. The pink-tinged water that may, on occasion, come out of the taps in thousands of homes that \"looks like a mild ros\u00e9 wine\" is a tangible - and worrying - example of the impact global warming is already having on Wales, according to Keith Jones, the National Trust's adviser on climate change. Standing in front of a giant, orange scar in the side of Cwm Crew valley in the southern Beacons, he points to the stream below which carries landslide debris into the nearby Cantref reservoir. It supplies drinking water for Cardiff and parts of Swansea. In total, the Brecon Beacons reservoirs supply 1.5m homes and businesses across south and mid Wales. Landslips were never unusual on these steep-sided slopes, Mr Jones explains, but are now happening with increasing regularity.  A quick glance further up the valley towards the summit of Pen y Fan - the highest peak in south Wales - and two more are clearly visible, with a further \"seven or eight\" out of sight, he says. \"What we have here is an indicator of quite dramatic change - more rainfall in winter, less in summer and the combination of that is causing problems at a landscape scale. \"[Remember] that old saying about canaries in the mines sensing danger? To me these are the canaries on climate change and they're singing very loudly now.\" The National Trust owns the land around five reservoirs in the Beacons and is now working with the national park authority, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water to tackle the problem. This includes a pilot scheme to plant 9,000 willow trees on slopes deemed at high risk, to try to slow the flow of water when it rains and prevent soil slipping away. Down at the reservoir itself Philippa Pearson, head of water services science at Welsh Water, agrees changes in the climate, particularly more intense rainfall events, are to blame. \"Whereas in the past we would have seen [landslides] just in the winter months, now they're all year round,\" she says. The most severe slips have required Welsh Water to temporarily close their treatment works at Cantref and use \"more chemicals and energy\" to clean the water of the red sandstone.  Having worked with researchers at Aberystwyth University to map out the high-risk areas, she said the company was keen to explore nature-based solutions like tree-planting. \"We could change our treatment works and build more sophisticated processes, but we feel it is right to try and tackle the problem at source and make our landscapes more resilient so we are able to face threats like climate change in the future,\" said Dr Pearson. The National Trust, which has described climate change as the \"single biggest threat\" to the land and properties it cares for, has also spent a year mapping looming hazards across Wales. The research shows the Brecon Beacons getting warmer and wetter - both increasing the risk of landslides - and is among the most high-risk areas. Elsewhere, flooding, coastal erosion, wildfires and drought conditions also pose significant threats. \"We've brought as much data and information together as possible to see what 2050 looks like and it's not a good place,\" Mr Jones concludes. \"If we cut our carbon today and in the coming years, it doesn't have to be. We're planning for the worst, hoping for the best. \"Even though it presents quite a challenge, I still get to wake up in the morning and think we're doing something about it.\" Why is the weather so rubbish right now?

{"id":null,"body":"By Dulcie Lee & Joseph Lee BBC News World leaders meeting in Cornwall are to adopt strict measures on coal-fired power stations as part of the battle against climate change. The G7 group will promise to move away from coal plants, unless they have technology to capture carbon emissions. It comes as Sir David Attenborough warned that humans could be \"on the verge of destabilising the entire planet\". He said G7 leaders faced the most important decisions in human history. The coal announcement came from the White House, which said it was the first time the leaders of wealthy nations had committed to keeping the projected global temperature rise to 1.5C. That requires a range of urgent policies, chief among them being phasing out coal burning unless it includes carbon capture technology. Coal is the world's dirtiest major fuel and ending its use is seen as a major step by environmentalists, but they also want guarantees rich countries will deliver on previous promises to help poorer nations cope with climate change. The G7 will end the funding of new coal generation in developing countries and offer up to \u00a32bn ($2.8bn)to stop using the fuel. Climate change has been one of the key themes at the three-day summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. Leaders of the seven major industrialised nations - the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - are expected to set out plans to reduce emissions from farming, transport, and the making of steel and cement. They will commit to protecting 30% of global land and marine areas for nature by 2030. They are also expected to pledge to almost halve their emissions by 2030, relative to 2010 levels. The UK has already surpassed that commitment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold a news conference on Sunday afternoon, the final day of a summit where he has  clashed with EU leaders  over the Brexit deal's requirements for checks on goods from Britain to Northern Ireland. A video message from Sir David Attenborough was played to world leaders in Cornwall on Sunday as they set out their plans for meeting emissions targets. Speaking beforehand, Sir David said: \"The natural world today is greatly diminished... Our climate is warming fast. That is beyond doubt. Our societies and nations are unequal and that is sadly plain to see. \"But the question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether as a result of these intertwined facts we are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet.\" He said the decisions facing the world's richest countries were \"the most important in human history\". This video can not be played As well as the measures on coal and ending almost all direct government support for the fossil fuel sector overseas, the G7 is expected to phase out petrol and diesel cars. China, which  according to one report  was responsible for 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019 - the most of any country - is not part of the G7. By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst Green campaigners say the summit's a flop because it failed to secure the cash previously promised for poor nations to cope with a heating climate on top of the Covid pandemic. Charities warn developing nations won't co-operate with the vital climate summit in Glasgow in November (known as COP26) unless adequate support is offered to tackle both crises. Rich nations previously pledged to hand $100bn a year to developing nations for climate assistance. But although the G7 did offer some extra bilateral funding it's clear that falls short. The G7's commitment to phase out coal at home and stop financing coal overseas is significant - it will heap pressure on China to follow. Details are still lacking, but there are also potentially important developments focusing finance to renewable energy and railways in developing nations to counterbalance China's Belt and Road mega-project. So, some progress has been made. And the aim to strike a global climate-protecting agreement at the COP may still be just about in reach - unless the climate offers surprises of its own. The Earth's average temperature is about 15C (59F) but has been much higher and lower in the past.   There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.  This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy.  Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.  This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C (86F) colder and hostile to life. Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.  This is known as climate change or global warming. You can read our simple explainer  here. The G7 leaders are also expected to endorse a plan aimed at reversing the loss of biodiversity - a measure of how many different species live in ecosystems - by the end of the decade. Mr Johnson is also launching a \u00a3500m fund to protect the world's oceans and marine life. The \"blue planet fund\" will help countries including Ghana, Indonesia and Pacific Island states, tackle unsustainable fishing, protect and restore coastal ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs, and reduce marine pollution. A major UN report from 2019 said that  global emissions of carbon dioxide must peak by 2020  to keep the planet from warming by more than 1.5C.

{"id":null,"body":"By James Williams BBC Politics Wales Wales needs to do twice as much on climate change in the next decade \"as we've done in the previous 30 years\", the climate change minister has said. Julie James said it was \"stretching an ambitious target\" but that it would be possible to reach it. All road schemes in Wales are set to be reviewed and a new law to tackle air pollution will be introduced in this term of the Welsh Parliament. Wales is aiming to reach  net zero carbon emissions by 2050 . But a  December 2020 report  by the Climate Change Committee, which advises governments in the UK, said: \"Underlying indicators and the lack of a cohesive, economy-wide strategy for 2050 - at both UK and Welsh government level - mean that Wales was not currently on track for the existing 80% target, let alone net zero.\" Speaking on the  BBC Politics Wales  programme, the newly appointed climate change minister said: \"It is possible to do it but it will mean all of us playing our part.  \"So, there will be some things that will need to change... but what we need to do is put the conditions in place so that people aren't sacrificing things in order to assist the climate.\" Friends of the Earth Cymru has called for a  ban on new roads  in Wales.  Asked if there should be a ban, Ms James said: \"It's tempting, isn't it, to say, 'of course we won't build new roads', but there are really complex issues here around air quality, what traffic routes people take, how many cars on the road and so on.\" The Deeside \"red route\" plan for the A55 in Flintshire includes a new  eight-mile (13km) dual carriageway . The minister said, as part of a new transport strategy, the government \"will do a rapid review of all our road schemes and we will do a review of both new road schemes and existing roads\". Cardiff council is set to decide on Thursday whether a  key road in the capital will reopen to private vehicles .  Ms James said it was a decision for the Labour-led council but added: \"Cardiff did incredibly well in putting active travel routes in across the city [during the height of the pandemic] and we'd very much want to encourage them to continue on that journey.\" A Clean Air Act, as promised by Welsh Labour in the Senedd election, is \"absolutely\" a priority for the government, the minister said. She added: \"We will be bringing that forward. \"We've got a lot of work to do to make sure we've got all the proper infrastructure in place to monitor the air quality and to make sure people do the right things.\" A review will also be conducted of the Welsh government's subsidy for the Holyhead to Cardiff air route. Ms James said she was open-minded about the route's future: \"I don't know what the effect of that plane on the environment is because I don't know what people who go on the plane would do if they weren't on the plane.  \"So, it's a more complex thing than the simple, plane bad, car good, because if all those people go in to cars we might make the situation worse and I genuinely don't know the answer to that.\" The government has  announced a moratorium on new biomass plants , many of which have proved controversial.  Asked if it was a mistake to allow existing biomass plants, the minister said: \"Well, you know, life is changing, isn't it?  \"We didn't know 10 years ago what we know now so we're keeping up with that. \"So, the government is moving forward as we learn new science,\" she said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The world's rich nations which caused the climate crisis know what's expected of them - but they consistently fail to deliver in full. This summit made some progress, especially on heralding the demise of coal - the fuel that drove the industrial revolution and sent emissions soaring. But for the umpteenth time the rich club has failed to deliver on its promise to channel $100bn a year to poor nations coping with a heating climate. Yes, bilateral deals have offered top-up funding to developing nations - but although we haven't seen the details yet, it's clear that they won't tot up to the magic 100 mark. And campaigners are warning there will be no over-arching deal to protect the climate unless that sum is reached and guaranteed at the vital COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in December. Teresa Anderson, from Action Aid said: \"The G7's reaffirmation of the previous $100 billion a year target doesn't come close to addressing the urgency and scale of the crisis.  \"Rich countries have so far failed to deliver on climate finance pledges. The majority of what has been provided so far has been in the form of loans, which are pushing vulnerable countries further into debt and poverty. \"The G7 must announce real finance through grants and stop turning a blind eye while the world's poorest and most marginalised are hit hardest.\" The finance issue - a running sore in climate negotiations - has been compounded by demands from poor nations for more Covid help. This row overshadowed some more promising moves from G7. President Biden talked up the end of coal for power generation in America (with no details of a date, or of how he would get legislation through Congress). Germany and Japan will face difficulty on this issue, too. The president also trumpeted the end of coal finance for poor nations. This will heap pressure on China to follow suit.  The initiative to specifically target coal was led originally by the UK, which deserves credit for spotting a deliverable policy in the morass of vague talk about climate action. There's another detail on coal, too: a handful of rich nations will offer up to $2bn a year to help emerging economies turn away from coal. It's another sign that the world is in this climate fight together, although the sum is small. There's also an important initiative on specific targeting of sectors of the economy, including agriculture, steel, cement and transport.  Campaigners wanted G7 to follow the  UK's lead and announce a global phase-out of the sales of fossil fuel powered vehicles . The leaders agreed - but significantly - they didn't give a date.  A global power game was also suggested by Boris Johnson  to combat China's geo-political through it's gargantuan Belt and Road programme bringing roads and ports to Africa. .  The PM offered instead a G7 new Marshall Plan offering railways and solar farms, although that initiative did appear to have been invented without details. This video can not be played Laurence Tubiana, the former French climate negotiator - a key actor in the triumphant Paris climate conference in 2015 - said: \"In the face of a perfect storm of planetary crises - the world's richest democracies have responded with a plan to make a plan.\" And swelling the challenge still further is the inconvenient fact that 20 years ago the G7 wealthy countries could really determine the fate of the climate. Now we'd have to add India to the list. And Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey, Nigeria and South Africa. Oh yes, and China. All these wakening giants will be more ready to act if they can see their rich counterparts put their finance where their words are.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match \"rhetoric with reality\". It urged Boris Johnson to treat \"the climate emergency as the emergency it is\" and show \"greater ambition\". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has  predicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year , as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded.  Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: \"The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,\" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: \"At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time.\" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement \"fantastic\", but added: \"We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing.\" Mr Murray said ministers were \"facing both directions at the same time\", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were \"still pushing a \u00a327bn roads budget\". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to \u00a350bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: \"The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years.  \"If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action.\" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: \"Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own.\" He added: \"The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action.\" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: \"The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. \"So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality.\" He added: \"We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action.\"    Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: \"The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable.   \"The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.\"                 Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Conor Macauley BBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent The head of a climate advisory body has said it would be \"morally wrong\" for NI to be set a target for cutting emissions that it cannot reach. Lord Deben, chairman of the UK's Climate Change Committee, was giving evidence to a Stormont scrutiny committee on Thursday. The government body is examining proposals for Northern Ireland's first climate change bill. The bill would create a target of net zero emissions by 2045. Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots has opposed the bill, claiming it would have a detrimental impact on agri-food, Northern Ireland's biggest emitting sector. He is preparing separate legislation based on recommendations from Lord Deben's committee. It has advised a cut of at least 82% in greenhouse gas emissions in Northern Ireland by 2050, as part of a wider UK target of net zero. It said it had taken into account the economic reliance on agriculture and the fact that Northern Ireland exports much of the food it produces to the rest of the UK. Lord Deben said the cut of at least 82% he had proposed would be \"bloody difficult\" and was the highest he could demand \"in the present circumstances\", although it could be reviewed if those circumstances changed. \"But I don't think it helps anybody to aim at something, when all the research which has been done by very significant people, working hard to get it right, says is not possible.\" Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Poots' climate legislation is now with the minister and will proceed if he can get it onto the executive agenda for approval. Departmental officials told the scrutiny committee that there was nothing to stop the two climate bills running alongside one another through the legislative process. One official said legal advice had been taken on the issue and there were elements of both bills which could complement one another. \"The simple answer is that it's massively complicated, yes the two bills can go and it wouldn't be as simple as saying that one supersedes the other.\" NI's first ever climate bill moves to next stage Minister pushes on with his own NI climate bill Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The International Energy Agency (IEA) is predicting a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. Total energy emissions for 2021 will still be slightly lower than in 2019, the agency says. But CO2 will rise by the second largest annual amount on record.  The use of coal in Asia is expected to be key: the IEA says it will push global demand up by 4.5%, taking it close to the global peak seen in 2014.  However, renewable energy is also booming, with green sources set to supply 30% of electricity this year. The empty roads, high streets and airports that marked the global response to coronavirus saw the biggest fall in demand for energy since World War Two.  That decline saw carbon emissions tumble by around 6% in 2020, as the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and oil were hardest hit by restrictions.  Many hoped that these changes in energy use would be sustained in the recovery from the pandemic, but  these latest predictions from the IEA  indicate that is not likely to be the case.  Energy demand is booming in the developing world, with a rise of 3.4% predicted for this year - this contrasts with richer economies, where overall energy use is expected to still be 3% below 2019.  In the places where energy demand is growing, coal is playing a key role.  Overall global use declined by around 4% in 2020, but is expected to rise by 4.5% this year. This is mainly happening in Asia, where China is leading the way and expected to account for more than half of the global coal growth this year. But even in the US and EU, where coal has been on the back foot for some time, demand is expected to rise - although it will still likely remain below 2019 levels in these regions. According to the IEA, coal demand is likely to be close to the global peak seen in 2014 - and that has implications for efforts to rein in climate change.  \"Global carbon emissions are set to jump by 1.5 billion tonnes this year - driven by the resurgence of coal use in the power sector,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director. \"This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate.\" The emissions predictions for 2021 would be even worse, according to the IEA, if demand for oil increased to pre-covid levels.  By the end of this year, oil use for aviation is still expected to be 20% below 2019 levels. However there are some strong positives for renewable energy in the IEA report. Wind, solar and other sustainable forms grew 3% during 2020, and in the power sector they are expected to grow by 8% this year.  Overall green energy sources will provide 30% of electricity generation, the highest level since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Reflecting the complexities of the global energy picture, China is likely to account for almost half the global increase in renewable electricity this year.  \"As we have seen at the country-level in the past 15 years, the countries that succeed to cut their emissions are those where renewable energy replaces fossil energy,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, who has  studied the factors  that drive countries to change their power systems.  \"What seems to be happening now is that we have a massive deployment of renewable energy, which is good for tackling climate change, but this is occurring alongside massive investments in coal and gas.\" \"Stimulus spending post-Covid-19 worldwide is still largely funding activities that lock us into high CO2 emissions for decades.\" Later this week, President Biden will host a climate summit, with around 40 presidents and prime ministers expected to take part virtually.  The US is also expected to announce a significantly improved emissions cutting target for 2030. According to the IEA, these actions can't come quickly enough if emissions are to be reined in to keep the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement within sight.  \"Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022,\" said Dr Birol from the IEA. \"The leaders' summit on climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.\"  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Alex Therrien BBC News Sales of halogen lightbulbs are to be banned in the UK from September, with fluorescent lights to follow, under government climate change plans.  The move will cut 1.26 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year and deliver consumers savings, officials say.  The UK began phasing out the sale of higher-energy halogen lightbulbs in 2018 under EU-wide rules. Now retailers will no longer be able to sell most remaining halogen bulbs, such as kitchen spotlights. Legislation for the plans is being brought forward this month by the government.  The plan will help continue the shift to low-energy LED lightbulbs, which account for about two-thirds of lights now sold in Britain. It is expected to mean LEDs will account for 85% of all bulbs sold by 2030, officials said. LED lights last five times longer than traditional halogen bulbs and produce the same amount of light, but use up to 80% less power. To help people to choose the most efficient lightbulbs, changes to the energy labels that consumers see on bulb packaging are being brought in, with the A+, A++ and A+++ ratings abandoned and efficiency graded between A-G, with only the most efficient bulbs given an A rating. LED bulbs could be incorporated into the fluorescent light fittings as a more energy-efficient alternative, officials said.  Legislation will also include moves to phase out high-energy fluorescent lightbulbs - such as strip lights commonly found in offices - with a view to bringing an end to their sale from September 2023. There was a time when the humble light bulb became the centre of a political storm over \"green madness\". The EU had announced a ban on old-fashioned incandescent bulbs - the ones that give off more heat than light and use a lot of electricity in the process. It was a move that led to a campaign of resistance with one newspaper even giving away the bulbs to encourage their use. But this latest move - the final step in ending sales of halogen lights - comes in very different times.  Many types of halogen bulbs were already banned several years ago, so this is a tightening of the screw on energy waste rather than a massive upheaval. But it does provide another signal that if the UK is to meet its promises to tackle the heating of the climate, every sector of the economy - in fact almost every aspect of our lives - will have to see some kind of change.   The cut in carbon emissions as a result of the new rules is the equivalent of removing more than half a million cars from the UK's roads, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said.  It is part of a package of measures which it says will save consumers money and includes the right to get goods repaired, new energy labels and higher efficiency standards for white goods, TVs and other appliances. Energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: \"We're phasing out old inefficient halogen bulbs for good, so we can move more quickly to longer-lasting LED bulbs, meaning less waste and a brighter and cleaner future for the UK. \"By helping ensure electrical appliances use less energy but perform just as well, we're saving households money on their bills and helping tackle climate change.\" Stephen Rouatt, chief executive of Signify UK, which owns Philips lighting, said: \"Using energy-efficient LED equivalents for halogen and fluorescent lighting on an even broader scale will significantly help the UK on its journey to decarbonisation, as well as lowering the annual electricity bills for consumers.\" LED lights making dent in UK energy demand Government to speed up UK climate change target Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent Climate change and nature loss are interlinked and must be tackled together. That's the finding of a key report by 50 leading scientists searching for combined solutions to the climate and biodiversity crises. \"Quick fixes\" for climate change risk harming nature, say the experts. Potential \"climate and biodiversity fails\" include misguided tree planting and large-scale bioenergy crops. The report is the first collaboration between two groups of influential scientists advising international governments on tackling climate change and extinction. Prof Camille Parmesan of Plymouth University, a co-author of the report, said smarter tree planting strategies are needed. For example, plantations of a single species of non-native tree \"are a disaster\", she said, as these forests will be vulnerable to extreme weather or outbreaks of plant pests. \"Every tree is the same species,\" she said. \"That fungus or that moth or that beetle just goes boom, boom, boom from one tree to another and you lose the whole forest within one season, one drought, one heatwave.\" While some timber plantations are needed to supply wood for building we must include native trees in the landscape, said Prof Pete Smith of the University of Aberdeen, who also contributed to the report. He warned of the dangers of \"an epic fail for the climate and for biodiversity\" such as planting trees for forestry on peatlands, which happened in the 1970s and 1980s in the UK. Peatlands suck carbon dioxide out of the air when in a healthy condition, but 80% of the UK's peatlands are still in a damaged state, meaning they contribute to carbon emissions. The report was compiled by scientists from the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ipbes). It found that previous policies have largely tackled biodiversity loss and climate change independently of each other rather than taking a holistic approach. The authors highlighted areas where efforts to tackle climate change could be harmful to nature, including: Commenting on the report, Dr Will Pearse of Imperial College London's Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, said only by treating climate, biodiversity, and human society as coupled systems can we address \"the current catastrophes\".  He said \"simple 'quick fixes'\", such as tree planting or technological innovations, are shown to be ineffective (and sometimes actively harmful) when implemented without a holistic approach.  \"Taking examples from the report, large-scale tree-planting can be harmful to biodiversity or food production, while reliance on rare-earth metals in technological solutions need safe disposal at the end of their lifecycle. \" The report has been released in the run up to two key global summits later this year. Meetings in China and the UK will set the world's course for tackling nature loss and climate change in subsequent decades. Follow Helen  on Twitter.

More than 60 Welsh charities and organisations have joined forces to  launch the Climate.Cymru campaign , and 1,000 individuals, families and businesses have already contributed their own personal stories and suggestions about addressing the threat of global warming.  They will be presented to Welsh politicians and showcased as part of an interactive display in the events hall at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) - which will be attended by world leaders in Glasgow later this year. So far, Ms Ventris-Field, the chief executive of the Welsh Centre for International Affairs, said they ranged from demands to protect nature and wildlife - which had become \"really important\" for people during lockdown - to making electric vehicles and public transport more affordable. The priority was to hear from communities that would be the most affected by the huge economic changes needed to meet goals around cutting greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades, and those already being hit by the impacts of climate change, she explained. \"In order to make the transition (to a greener Wales) happen in a way that doesn't impact people who are already struggling - their voices need to be heard,\" Ms Ventris-Field added. \"You don't have to be a climate expert to see the changes in weather patterns, to see the increases in flooding that we've seen here in Wales which have been so difficult for people in a year where they're already battling with the pandemic.\" \"It's so important that we start to take robust action as soon as possible across all sectors and society - but in order to do that we need governments to set the right framework,\" Ms Ventris-Field added. \"Putting that into practice is going to need people from across Wales who can add their voice and say 'this is how we think it could happen'.\" Blaenau Gwent recently held a \"Climate Assembly\" involving 50 residents to help inform planning by the local council and other organisations. Meanwhile, a cross-party Environmental Justice Commission, set up by the IPPR think tank, asked people from across the south Wales valleys to be part of a \"citizens jury\" working with experts to provide suggestions for politicians. Others have been held in County Durham, Aberdeenshire and Essex. The organisation said it was vital these areas did not \"face a repeat of the injustices confronted during the last industrial transition\". Valleys areas continue to face adverse impacts caused by historic mine closures and the resulting loss of local employment, it warned. That affects how people travel - with many dependent on polluting cars to get in and out of the area for work, and limited public transport options. The jurors argued that it was key the transition to a greener future ensured people could succeed while staying local. Jesse Patton, from Ystalyfera, who runs a business supplying equipment to pubs and restaurants said it had been \"scary at times\" learning more about the severity of the climate situation. But he said the sessions had encouraged him to make changes to his business - ensuring all disposable products he supplied were biodegradable or recyclable, and ditching single-use plastics. \"You don't realise the severity of the issue until the facts and figures are given - but learning what we can do about it and how we can change was really informative, really good.\" The jurors called for an economic strategy for the valleys geared around \"anchor towns\" with local hubs for remote working and revitalised high streets to encourage people to shop sustainably. Significant investment in green public transport options was urged - with car-free town centres pitched as an attempt to improve air quality. And digital infrastructure - like fast broadband - \"should be treated as a basic human right\" - to support all sorts of jobs to be done remotely after the pandemic. Katie Lloyd, a sales and marketing executive from Neath, said the sessions encouraged her to go back to university and pursue a masters degree about sustainability. \"It's given us an opportunity to reflect on what we can do in our community and [how it could] create more opportunities locally, meaning people don't have to leave the area and really make the most of where they live,\" she said. Becca Massey-Chase, of the Environmental Justice Commission, said the jury was the \"first of its kind in Wales\" and had produced \"insightful and practical proposals for tackling the climate crisis and restoring nature in a way that is fair for everyone.\" \"Huge changes to the way we live and work were inevitable over the coming decades,\" she said. \"Things are going to be done but it's how it's done that's going to be really important. \"If we're going to make the progress that we need to make then we need to involve people, because we need the public to be supportive of the action and see it as fair. \"Our jury told us they want to be part of the change, they want to be involved in the decision making - they want things done with them not to them.\" New targets on Wales' climate change gases What is climate change doing to Wales?

{"id":null,"body":"Germany's climate change laws are insufficient and violate fundamental freedoms by putting the burden of curbing CO2 emissions on the young, its highest court has ruled. It says the law fails to give enough detail on cutting CO2 emissions after current targets end in 2030. \"The provisions irreversibly offload major emission reduction burdens on to periods after 2030,\" it found. The government will now have to revise the law by the end of the next year. The decision comes a week after the EU unveiled ambitious new climate change targets. Under the law, which was agreed between member states and the European Parliament, the bloc will cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Like the EU legislation, Germany's domestic climate change law provides for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. The 2019 law was agreed as part of Germany's response to the 2016 Paris climate deal, which aims to keep the global temperature rise well under 2C - and preferably to 1.5C - to prevent the worst effects of climate change. This video can not be played But the German Constitutional Court said on Thursday that current measures \"violate the freedoms of the complainants, some of whom are still very young\" because they delay too much of the action needed to reach the Paris targets until after 2030. \"In order to achieve this, the reductions still required after 2030 will have to be achieved more urgently and at short notice,\" it said. Should Germany use up most of its permitted CO2 emissions by this time, future generations could face a \"serious loss of freedom\". \"Virtually any freedom is potentially affected by these future emission reduction obligations, because almost all areas of human life are still associated with the emission of greenhouse gases and are therefore threatened by drastic restrictions after 2030,\" the court said. Thursday's ruling partially upheld complaints brought by climate change activists - most of them young - and environmental groups between 2018 and 2020. German climate activist Luisa Neubauer from the Fridays for Future movement and one of the plaintiffs in the case, described the decision as a \"huge win for the climate movement\". \"Today's inaction mustn't harm our freedom & rights in the future,\" she said. One of the lawyers involved in the case, Felix Ekardt, hailed the \"ground-breaking victory\". Following the announcement,  German organisation Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) tweeted a letter written by an 11-year-old girl (in German)  in 2019, which had led to its own involvement in the case. \"I would like to take the government to court because the politicians aren't taking the impending climate catastrophe seriously enough, and I want people in 100 to 150 years to still know what snow is,\" the pupil wrote. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze also welcomed the decision, which she described as \"a clear strengthening of climate protection\". \"I would have liked to have included a further interim goal for the 2030s in the [2019] law but at the time there was no majority for that,\" she said. Other countries have also focused on climate change in recent days, with Poland reaching a draft agreement with trade unions to close all of its coal mines by 2049 and organise severance payments for the tens of thousands of workers affected. Last week, the US hosted a virtual climate summit of 40 global leaders, with President Joe Biden pledging to cut US carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. Meanwhile,  the UK announced radical plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 , although environmentalists warn that the government has consistently failed to achieve previous targets set by its independent Climate Change Committee.

{"id":null,"body":"Tackling climate change is about \"growth and jobs\" not \"expensive bunny hugging\", Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at a virtual summit, the prime minister told world leaders \"we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener.\" At the same event, US President Joe Biden pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Mr Johnson praised Mr Biden for \"returning the US to the front rank of the fight against climate change\". One of Mr Biden's first acts as president was to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, months after his predecessor Donald Trump had taken the US out.  Forty other leaders attended the summit including China's President Xi Jinping who reiterated a promise to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It is hoped that all countries will commit to further carbon emission cuts at the COP26 conference due to be held in Glasgow this November. Earlier this week, the UK government announced its own plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% compared to 1990 levels by 2035.  Labour welcomed the new commitment - which brings the current target forward by 15 years - but said the government \"can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality\". The party's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband urged ministers to match promises with \"much more decisive action\".  This video can not be played In his speech to the Leaders Summit on Climate, Mr Johnson said UK's carbon emissions were lower than at any point since the 19th century. He also praised the wind power sector in the country, describing the UK as \"the Saudi Arabia of wind\".  The prime minister called on other countries to \"make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change\" by setting their own tough targets on carbon emissions. He also emphasised the connection between wildlife and climate, saying: \"If we're going to tackle climate change we have to deal with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet.\" And he sought to play up the economic benefits of fighting climate change arguing: \"It's vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive, politically correct, green act of bunny hugging. \"What I'm driving at is this is about growth and jobs.\" The prime minister's contribution to today's virtual climate jamboree included familiar lines from him: the UK being the \"Saudi Arabia of wind\" power and him being a man keen on having your cake and eating it: \"cake, have, eat\" as he put it. He didn't dwell on what many say would be the colossal costs and changes society will have to take on to get to net zero emissions. There is a bigger picture here too: the prime minister casting himself as a globally central figure in all this, ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Mr Johnson welcomed the return of the United States \"to the front rank of the fight against climate change,\" with President Biden replacing Donald Trump. Mr Biden will be an enthusiastic participant in Glasgow later this year, whereas it would have been far from certain a re-elected President Trump would have even turned up. Climate change, the ultimate international issue, has turned diplomacy green: for the prime minister, it is central to his vision for \"Global Britain.\" Have countries kept their climate change promises?

{"id":null,"body":"The G7 nations have agreed to step up action on climate change and renewed a pledge to raise $100bn a year to help poor countries cut emissions. After a summit in Britain, G7 leaders also promised to help developing countries move away from coal. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the three-day meeting, said on Sunday: \"We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us.\"  However some environmental groups said the promises lacked detail.  Developed countries agreed in 2009 to contribute $100bn a year in climate finance to poorer countries by 2020. But the target was not met, in part because of the Covid pandemic. While the G7 agreed to raise contributions to meet the target, Teresa Anderson, from Action Aid said: \"The G7's reaffirmation of the previous $100 billion a year target doesn't come close to addressing the urgency and scale of the crisis.\" Catherine Pettengell, director at Climate Action Network, told Reuters news agency: \"We had hoped that the leaders of the world's richest nations would come away from this week having put their money their mouth is.\" Climate change has been one of the key themes at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. The G7 - which include the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - committed to keeping the projected global temperature rise to 1.5C.  In the  final statement  they said: \"We reaffirm the collective developed countries goal to jointly mobilise $100bn\/year from public and private sources, through to 2025.\" The commitment to help nations move away from coal power, which initially came from the White House, includes a plan to phase out coal burning unless it includes carbon capture technology. The G7 will end the funding of new coal generation in developing countries and offer up to \u00a32bn ($2.8bn) to stop using the fuel.  Coal is the world's dirtiest major fuel and ending its use is seen as a major step by environmentalists, but they also want guarantees rich countries will deliver on previous promises to help poorer nations cope with climate change. In a separate announcement, the UK joined Germany and the US to declare it would spend hundreds of millions of pounds protecting the world's vulnerable communities from climate change. The funding would \"enable quicker responses to extreme weather and climate-linked disasters in countries bearing the brunt of climate change,\" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst Green campaigners say the summit's a flop because it failed to secure the cash previously promised for poor nations to cope with a heating climate on top of the Covid pandemic. Charities warn developing nations won't co-operate with the vital climate summit in Glasgow in November (known as COP26) unless adequate support is offered to tackle both crises. Rich nations previously pledged to hand $100bn a year to developing nations for climate assistance. But although the G7 did offer some extra bilateral funding it's clear that falls short. The G7's commitment to phase out coal at home and stop financing coal overseas is significant - it will heap pressure on China to follow. Details are still lacking, but there are also potentially important developments focusing finance to renewable energy and railways in developing nations to counterbalance China's Belt and Road mega-project. So, some progress has been made. And the aim to strike a global climate-protecting agreement at the COP may still be just about in reach - unless the climate offers surprises of its own. This video can not be played The G7 leaders  published a 25-page communique  summing up their \"shared agenda\" in key points. They included: Sunday's meeting began with video message from the British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.  Speaking beforehand, Sir David said: \"The natural world today is greatly diminished... Our climate is warming fast. That is beyond doubt. Our societies and nations are unequal and that is sadly plain to see. \"But the question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether as a result of these intertwined facts we are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet.\" He said the decisions facing the world's richest countries were \"the most important in human history\". The Earth's average temperature is about 15C (59F) but has been much higher and lower in the past.   There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.  This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy.  Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.  This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C (54F) colder and hostile to life. Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.  This is known as climate change or global warming. You can read our simple explainer  here.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Sharp divisions between the major global emitters have emerged at a series of meetings designed to make progress on climate change. India lambasted the richer world's carbon cutting plans, calling long term net zero targets, \"pie in the sky.\" Their energy minister said poor nations want to continue using fossil fuels and the rich countries \"can't stop it\". China meanwhile  declined to attend  a different climate event organised by the UK. Trying to lead 197 countries forward on the critical global issue of climate change is not a job for the faint hearted, as the UK is currently finding out.  As president of  COP26 , this year's crucial climate meeting due to take place in Glasgow in November, Britain is charged with ensuring a successful summit of world leaders and their negotiators. To that end, the UK team have embarked on a series of meetings to find the building blocks of agreement, so that the world keeps the  temperature targets  agreed in Paris in 2015 within reach.  To have a decent chance of keeping the increase in global temperature under 1.5C - which is now considered as the gateway to dangerous warming - carbon emissions need to reach net zero by 2050.  Net zero refers to balancing out any greenhouse gas emissions produced by industry, transport or other sources by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. A range of major carbon-producing countries, including the US, the UK, Japan and the EU, have signed up to the idea. Last September,  China said it would get there by 2060 .  India, the world's fourth largest emitter, doesn't seem keen to join the club.  \"2060 sounds good, but it is just that, it sounds good,\" Raj Kumar Singh, India's minister for power, told a meeting organised by the International Energy Agency (IEA). \"I would call it, and I'm sorry to say this, but it is just a pie in the sky.\" To the discomfort of his fellow panellists, Mr Singh singled out developed countries where per capita emissions are much higher than in India.  \"You have countries whose per capita emissions are four or five or 12 times the world average. The question is when are they going to come down?\" \"What we hear is that by 2050 or 2060 we will become carbon neutral, 2060 is far away and if the people emit at the rate they are emitting the world won't survive, so what are you going to do in the next five years that's what the world wants to know.\" Mr Singh pointed out that while it was the richer countries who had burned most of the fossil fuels that have caused the problems, they now wanted developing countries to stop - that was unfair, he said.  \"The developed world has occupied almost 80% of the carbon space already, you have 800 million people who don't have access to electricity. You can't say that they have to go to net zero, they have the right to develop, they want to build skyscrapers and have a higher standard of living, you can't stop it,\" he told the meeting.  China's minister Zhang Jianhua told the IEA virtual event that his country wanted \"increased mutual understanding and mutual trust to work as one\", on the issue of climate change. However, that desire to work as one didn't stretch as far as the UK, with China declining an invitation to take part in a key climate and development ministerial meeting for vulnerable countries.  There was a feeling among officials that diplomatic arguments with China over human rights were spilling over into the climate arena.  US special envoy on climate change, John Kerry, went out of his way to pour oil on troubled waters when speaking at the IEA event.  Both India and China see themselves as developing economies and want to retain some sense that richer Western nations have to take the lead on climate.  The former secretary of state was keen to say that there wouldn't be just the same carbon-cutting plan for every country, but everyone would have to do more.    \"We can't just willy-nilly ignore the next 10 years because the scientists tell us that if we don't do enough in the next 10 years we cannot keep the Earth's temperature at 1.5C, we cannot even get on a roadmap to net zero by 2050,\" he said. \"So my plea is to avoid the 'happy talk' and recognise that this challenge is global and never has there been a challenge that requires the unity of countries all across the planet than now.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales environment correspondent Tackling climate change slipped \"down the agenda\" in the years following the 2008 financial crash, according to Wales' former first minister. Carwyn Jones was defending his record in power after being announced as chair of climate charity Size of Wales. Mr Jones, a Senedd member for 22 years, said the issue needed to be the world's \"top priority\", warning communities and livelihoods risked being \"destroyed\". He  stood down from the Senedd  ahead of the election earlier this month. Mr Jones said he now wanted to make campaigning for action on climate change - \"the biggest challenge that humanity has faced since the second world war\" - a focus of his post-politics life. During his time as first minister between 2009 and 2018, major new laws such as the Environment Act and Well-being of Future Generations Act were passed, but Wales consistently failed to meet tree-planting targets and experienced years when greenhouse gas emissions went up instead of down. Pressed on his actions in office, he said there was \"always more to do\". This video can not be played He pointed to support for public transport and the creation of Transport for Wales as examples of positive action, despite criticism from the environment sector that emissions from transport only fell 3% in Wales between 1990 and 2016. \"I think the problem we've had in the past decade is people seem to be more supportive of dealing with climate change when they feel financially secure,\" he said.  \"After 2008 and  the crash that happened there , climate change started to go down the agenda across the world.   \"People were more interested in the need to prop up our economies, making sure people have money in their pockets and are secure. \"The two things are not contradictory, and I'm glad to see now that climate change is going back up the agenda across the world.\" While the pandemic had shown how changes could be instigated quickly, it had also highlighted a problem of \"countries not working together\", something that needed to be addressed in responding to global warming, he warned. This video can not be played His successor Mark Drakeford's decision to set up a climate change department in the Welsh government with a new minister and deputy minister to take charge of the issue was a \"hugely important signal\", he said.  \"We can give practical examples to show other countries that we're doing our bit in Wales - we're a small country but we can have a positive effect,\" he said. Size of Wales' director Nicola Pulman said the former first minister would bring \"a track record at the highest level of government in tackling climate change\" to the charity's work. It supports forest protection and tree growing projects in Africa, South America and south-east Asia as well as running a Wales-wide educational programme to help teach young people about climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A critical meeting on climate change, organised by the UK, appears to be the latest victim of an ongoing row with China.  Ministers from around 35 countries are due to participate in today's summit on climate and development. But while the US, EU, India and others are taking part, China is notable by its absence.  The UK says that China was invited to the event but is not participating.  Relations between the UK and China  have deteriorated in recent weeks  after angry exchanges about human rights.  Just a few days ago China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs- for spreading what it called \"lies and disinformation\" about the country. The move came in  retaliation for measures  taken by the UK government and others over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. Today's  climate and development summit  is being described by the UK as a \"key moment\" in the run up to  COP26 in Glasgow later this year .  A list of invitees was published two weeks ago including China. But when the final list of participants was circulated, they were absent.  A UK COP26 spokesman said China had been invited, adding: \"We look forward to working with them on climate change issues in this critical year ahead of COP26.\" When pressed on the reasons for the non-participation, no further comment was forthcoming. With major emitters such as the US, EU and India taking part, it would be expected that China would play a leading role in this type of event.  Not only is it the world's biggest carbon emitter but it also likes to portray itself as a key ally for developing countries.  \"To have the ministerial taking place without China is far from ideal,\" said Richard Black, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.  \"China is a major lender, trading partner and diplomatic presence across much of the developing world, and will of course be a hugely important power broker for COP26.\"  \"As John Kerry recently said, the logical approach of western nations is to carve out a constructive place to engage with China on climate change amid the very real differences on other issues. However, it's not yet clear if Chinese leaders will be prepared to go along with this - and the UK, as COP26 hosts, has a very tricky diplomatic path to steer.\" Hosted by COP26 President Alok Sharma and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, today's meeting is seen as an important platform for the countries that are most vulnerable to rising temperatures.  The gathering will hear from ministers and representatives of international institutions and much of the focus will be on climate finance and debt relief.  The question is critical for vulnerable nations.  Ministers from several threatened island states and poor countries will take part in the meeting, and they will likely make the point that while they contribute little to the causes of climate change they are already feeling the effects.  A report published recently by African finance ministers indicated that some countries are now spending up to 10% of their GDP adapting to the impacts of rising temperatures. The event is also facing criticism from environmental groups who are angry about the UK's decision late last year to cut overseas development assistance from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. \"Cuts to the overseas aid budget risk not only undermining the UK's reputation for progressive development action, but also the chances of the UK presidency delivering a successful outcome to COP26,\" said Andrew Norton from the International Institute for Environment and Development. \"The aid cuts undermine the UK's ability to ask other countries to step up, as well as reducing the resources available for climate action in poorer countries.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK prime minister is set to declare one of the most ambitious targets in the world for tackling climate change. BBC News understands Boris Johnson's goal will be to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% or 69% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. This will mean an even faster pace of decarbonisation for industries, transport and homes. It might, for instance, mean a faster switch away from gas boilers for home heating. Or it could, under another scenario, lead to the phase-out of gas-guzzling SUVs. The targets are known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They're at the heart of the Paris Agreement, the international pact signed in 2016 that's intended to cut emissions with the aim of keeping global temperature rise well under 2C.  NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Mr Johnson hopes that the UK\u2019s new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19.  The UK has assumed the presidency at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting - in partnership with Italy. The full meeting will take place at the end of next year. The 68% cut was deemed by the EU to be Britain\u2019s fair share towards combating climate change.  By adding another percentage point, the PM would attract favourable headlines from some environmentalists \u2013 although others think the number should be higher still, given the apparent impact of climate change on the world already. Green groups have called for a 75% cut, and research by consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by the Prince of Wales corporate leaders group, said a target of a 70% by 2030 was necessary. Tim Crosland, from the pressure group Extinction Rebellion, said 100% emissions cuts in the UK should be made by 2025 if the world was to avoid over-shooting the 1.5C temperature threshold agreed by the UN. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it wouldn\u2019t comment until it had seen the official figures. The true value of the PM\u2019s target won\u2019t be clear until details about background assumptions are revealed officially in coming days. One question is whether the UK could use international credits for achieving its target - in effect paying other nations to cut emissions on its behalf. The government's advisory Climate Change Committee has told the PM that credits would only be allowable if the target is more ambitious than 68%. It says in a letter: \"This trajectory for UK emissions is eminently achievable, provided effective policies are introduced across the economy without delay. These would bring significant benefits for the UK's economic recovery.  \"The NDC is more than just a number. It should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and Net Zero Strategy to deliver against the UK goal, clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions, and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries. \"It is also imperative that the NDC is accompanied by strengthened climate change adaptation plans.\" The 2030 date is important because CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are cumulative.  That means that if the UK doesn\u2019t radically reduce emissions by that date, it won\u2019t be able to achieve its long-term aim of net zero emissions by mid-century. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Only a handful of countries have submitted revised NDCs so far. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Paul Hudson Climate correspondent, BBC Look North As the impacts of a changing climate around the world become clearer, Yorkshire will not be spared the effects of global warming. On Monday, the World Meteorological Organisation revealed 2020 was one of the three warmest years on record globally, with the regional picture showing similar patterns. In the last 50 years or so, average summer temperatures here in Yorkshire have risen by 0.5C. That change will only accelerate without meaningful action. Changes to weather cycles pose a great threat to the magnificent biodiversity across our historic county, with warnings that wildlife will have to move or adapt.  If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue unchecked, the Met Office projects that summer temperatures may rise by 4.4C by 2080. In reality, that means average July daytime temperatures in Leeds and Sheffield would approach 26C - currently described as a particularly hot day.  At the same time, summer rainfall could drop by a quarter, so the weather conditions we experienced in summer 2018 - when temperatures soared and we faced a prolonged drought - would become normal.  With a projected increase in winter rainfall, we would experience a climate that regularly swung from one extreme to the other.  Such extreme swings would prove disastrous for thriving homes of birds and other wildlife, such as Ripon City Wetlands in North Yorkshire, which also acts as an important store of carbon.  \"It means a lot of the plants and other wildlife that really need these wet conditions will suffer and we could lose them,\" says Jonathan Leadley from the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.  \"We could see those species at the southerly end of their range here being pushed out of counties such as Yorkshire.\" The wetlands have recently seen certain bird and dragonfly species breeding in Yorkshire for the first time ever, but this changing picture is a symptom of a dangerous trend.  \"We mustn't forget that climate crisis is what's bringing those southern species into the UK,\" Mr Leadley says. This video can not be played If we focus on the city of Sheffield, February 2019 was the hottest on record, with the following February the wettest.  The three wettest autumns on the city's climate log - which has been monitoring conditions since 1882 -  have been recorded in the last 20 years.  And the hottest temperature ever recorded in the city was in July 2019 - a scorching 35C.  With changes to our climate expected to accelerate as emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise, it's understandable why there's so much alarm at what the future may hold. Back in Ripon, these high temperatures will spell disaster for its inhabitants and its ability to capture carbon.  \"If you're a plant or an animal that lives in a wetland, a summer drought can be quite catastrophic because the wet conditions that you thrive in are gone,\" Mr Leadley says. \"The wildlife will have to move or adapt somehow.\"  Follow BBC Yorkshire on  Facebook ,  Twitter  and  Instagram .

{"id":null,"body":"A \"game-changing\" new map shows the threats climate change may have on the UK's stately homes and landscapes. The National Trust warns the number of its sites facing a high level of threat from issues such as coastal erosion, extreme heat and flooding could rise from 5% to 17% over the next 40 years.  Its map plots a worst-case scenario where nothing is done over that time to drive down global carbon emissions.  The charity says planning for the worst will help it protect sites effectively. The map  is intended to help highlight potential future hazards in heritage or countryside sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Interventions can then be made to reduce the hazards - such as planting trees to provide shade in higher temperature areas, or restoring peat bogs to prevent flooding. The worst-case scenario shows: The charity wants to plant 20 million trees before 2030, and said the map will ensure trees are planted where they are needed most. National Trust director for land and nature Harry Bowell said: \"This map is a game-changer in how we face the threat climate change poses to the places we care for. \"While the data draws on a worst-case scenario, the map paints a stark picture of what we have to prepare for. But by acting now, and working with nature, we can adapt to many of these risks.\" The charity says staff are already taking action to cope with rising temperatures: The map plots the impacts of extreme heat and humidity, landslides, coastal erosion, shrinking and shifting ground due to wet and dry conditions known as \"soil heave\", and high winds, in 2020 and 2060. It uses data from a number of sources and plots them in 5km hexagonal grids across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The National Trust is also sharing available data on flooding with staff on properties prone to flooding and action that can be taken, but the information is too localised to be included on the map.

{"id":null,"body":"Hundreds of climate campaigners have staged a protest march targeting the G7 summit. The activists paraded from St Ives Leisure Centre to the middle of the Cornish town, escorted by police. They called for immediate action from the G7 world leaders to \"address the climate and ecological emergency\". Protests were also held in Falmouth, with climate change campaigners gathered on the beach, playing music and listening to speeches. The G7 leaders are expected to focus talks on climate change and global coronavirus vaccinations during the three-day event. At least 500 people joined the parade in St Ives, playing drums and chanting \"act now\" and \"sound the alarm\". Organisers said the protests were in response to the summit nations' \"failure to respect the global climate commitments they made in Paris in 2015\" and \"to urge the leaders meeting at Carbis Bay in Cornwall to act immediately to address the climate and ecological emergency\". Olympic sailor Laura Baldwin joined the protests as a member of Ocean Rebellion - Extinction Rebellion's sea-focused campaign group. She said: \"I've absorbed and understood the dire warnings of the world-leading scientists, academics and David Attenborough. \"As a result I'm terrified for the future of my child and all our children.\" Ms Baldwin said she was more stressed about the state of the planet than any competition as an Olympian. She said: \"I'm part of Ocean Rebellion because I'm an Olympic sailor and the ocean is where my heart is. I love the water and respect it.\" Penny Kent, who has travelled from Stroud to take part in the protest, said she was worried for her grandchildren's future. She said she wanted action from the G7 leaders \"immediately\". Nat Squire, 24, an osteopath graduate who lives in Cornwall, argued the government was not acting ambitiously enough and engaging in \"greenwashing\". \"They say they're going to do something but they don't have any intention.\" Protests were also held in Falmouth, with one family mocking up a graveyard in their front garden. Other climate change protesters gathered on the beach, playing music and listening to speeches.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst A landmark report says the UK can make major cuts to carbon emissions more cheaply than previously thought. The Climate Change Committee says that, for less than 1% of national wealth, the UK can reduce 78% of emissions by 2035, based on 1990 levels. This brings forward the UK\u2019s clean energy timetable by 15 years - a previously unimaginable leap. The report says the low costs for the transformation are due to new clean technologies also being more efficient. The authors say people can play their part by eating less red meat, curbing flying, driving less and installing low-carbon heating. They estimate the costs of the low-carbon revolution will scale up to an annual \u00a350bn by 2030 from around $10bn today, with most being private investment. By 2030, they estimate that some of these costs will be offset by fuel savings of \u00a318bn. Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway, University of London, who was not involved with the report, said: \"This is a massively important report that maps out a whole new economy for Britain to create a better country.  \u201cThis shows it can be done. It can be afforded. This is world-leading, and it\u2019ll persuade other countries also to follow the path.\u201c But sceptics say that the committee, which advises the government on climate matters, has underestimated the eventual bill and overestimated the government\u2019s ability to deliver change on the scale projected. But the committee, also known as the CCC, says: \u201cThe message to the government is clear: the 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action on climate change\u201d.  If its recommendations are carried out, the CCC says the UK will achieve its share of the UN target agreed under the Paris agreement drafted five years ago. This international deal aims to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C and \u201cpursue efforts\u201c to keep it under 1.5C.  So far, temperatures have increased around 1.1C and are contributing to devastating forest fires and ice loss at the poles. As a result, some scientists believe dangerous climate change may have already begun. CCC members say the targets proposed for the UK's \u201ccarbon budget\u201d period of 2033-2035 are definitely achievable, so long as the government moves urgently. The advisory body says the shift to electric vehicles will prove cheaper than sticking with petrol cars because the former is about three times more efficient. That means the government may need to claw back tax income by imposing pay-as-you-drive schemes. But the committee warns that ministers will need to shield the poorest in society. It will cost, for instance, an average of \u00a310,000 to insulate a home and install low-carbon heating such as heat pumps. The report says the government must find \u00a33-4bn a year to support households make the transition.  Ministers will also need to cushion low-income households from what\u2019s estimated to be a \u00a3100-a-year rise in electricity bills by 2030, although the report says this cost may be reduced by making appliances more efficient.  Environmental campaign groups have expressed delight that the costs of a clean society will be cheaper than previously thought, although they need convincing that the government will grasp the challenge. They point out that recently the Chancellor committed just \u00a31bn to insulating homes to save emissions, whilst pledging \u00a3127bn to HS2 and new roads that will increase emissions. The report says to get the best results, the UK government must start cutting emissions aggressively, to prevent them accumulating in the atmosphere.  It sets out the following conditions for success: The report says: \u201cMany people can make low-carbon choices, about how they travel, how they heat their homes, what they buy and what they eat.\u201d It also includes a measure of popular opinion, gleaned through the recent UK Climate Assembly \u2013 where members of the public participated in sessions with climate experts to establish a dialogue on the best ways to cut emissions. The assembly called for a tax on frequent flyers, a ban on selling polluting sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and a cut in meat consumption - although it stressed that people shouldn\u2019t be coerced into changing behaviours.  The CCC estimates that 16% of the effort to achieve the targets will come from behaviour change, such as shifts in diet or flying less. Another 41% will come from painless improvements in low carbon technology, and 43% will be a combination of technology and behaviour change. There will be a revolution in homes and how they're heated. This will involve insulating many more homes, making all new gas boilers hydrogen-ready - able to use cleaner hydrogen as a fuel - and making greater use of heat pumps. Follow Roger  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The UK minister tasked with leading UN climate talks says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition. Alok Sharma was speaking at the conclusion of a virtual climate summit organised by the UK, UN and France.  He said \"real progress\" had been made and 45 countries had put forward new climate plans for 2030. But these were not enough to prevent dangerous warming this century, Mr Sharma explained. Taking place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, the summit heard the UN Secretary General warn that every country needed to declare a climate emergency. Around 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organised by the UK, UN and France. They outlined new pledges and commitments to curb carbon. China's contribution was eagerly awaited, not just because it is the world's biggest emitter, but because it has recently promised to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Achieving net zero means that emissions have been cut as much as possible and any remaining releases are balanced by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, But while President Xi Jinping outlined a range of new targets for 2030, many analysts felt these did not go far enough. India brought little in the way of new commitments but Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country was on track to achieve its goals under the Paris agreement and promised a major uptick in wind and solar energy.   This video can not be played According to the UK, some 24 countries had outlined net zero commitments and 20 had now set out plans to adapt and become more resilient to rising temperatures and their impacts. But despite these commitments, Mr Sharma said not enough had been achieved.  \"Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,\" he said. \"But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. \"Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough.\" Mr Sharma re-stated a commitment made last year to double the UK's international climate finance spend. This will bring it to at least \u00a311.6bn over the next five years. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would \"save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs\". This video can not be played He added: \"Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere - against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming.\" Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres criticised rich countries for spending 50% more of their pandemic recovery cash on fossil fuels compared to low-carbon energy. Mr Guterres said that 38 countries had already declared a climate emergency and he called on leaders worldwide to now do the same.  On Covid recovery spending, he said that this is money being borrowed from future generations. \"We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mountain of debt on a broken planet,\" he said. The meeting is taking place after the pandemic caused the postponement of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting, which had been due to take place in Glasgow this year. The UK has announced an end to support for overseas fossil fuel projects, and has today deposited a new climate plan with the UN. It's the first time that Britain has had to do this, as it was previously covered by the European Union's climate commitments.  The UK pointed to its new commitment on overseas fossil fuel projects as well as a new carbon cutting target of 68% by 2030, announced last week by the prime minister. The EU presented a new 2030 target of a 55% cut in emissions, agreed after all-night negotiations this week. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \"It is the go-ahead for scaling up climate action across our economy and society.\" China's President Xi Jinping announced that the country would reduce its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% compared with 2005 levels. China will also increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by about 25%. And President Xi pledged to increase forest cover and boost wind and solar capacity. But Manish Bapna, managing director of the World Resources Institute (WRI) said: \"The strengthened renewable energy, carbon intensity, and forest targets are steps in the right direction, but recent WRI analysis shows that China would benefit more economically and socially if it aims higher, including by peaking emissions as early as possible.\" Although President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris pact, the summit saw statements from the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, and the Democrat governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who said the US was \"all-in\" on tackling climate change. Pope Francis said the Vatican had committed to reaching net zero emissions, similar to carbon neutrality, before 2050. \"The time has come to change course. Let us not rob future generations of the hope for a better future,\" he said. A number of big emitters, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, did not take part, as their climate actions were not deemed ambitious enough. Some observers believe this hard line on some countries is justified. \"From a kind of symbolic procedural point of view, it's good to have everybody on board,\" said Prof Heike Schroeder from the University of East Anglia. \"But from a proactive, creating some kind of sense of urgency approach, it also makes sense to say we only get to hear from you if you have something new to say.\" The five years since the Paris agreement was adopted have been the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and emissions have continued to accrue in the atmosphere. But many countries and businesses have started the process of decarbonisation in that time. The progress they've made now needs to be acknowledged and encouraged, says former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. \"That progress that's been seen in the real economy has to be reflected and incentivised further by those additional commitments,\" she said. One area that yielded little progress at this meeting was the question of finance. Rich countries had promised to mobilise $100bn a year from 2020 under the Paris agreement - but the commitments on cash are not forthcoming. Follow Matt  on Twitter. What is climate change?

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs Environment correspondent Scientists say a \"forgotten\" coffee plant that can grow in warmer conditions could help future-proof the drink against climate change.  They predict we could soon be sipping Stenophylla, a rare wild coffee from West Africa that tastes like Arabica coffee, but grows in warmer conditions. As temperatures rise, good coffee will become increasingly difficult to grow. Studies suggest that by 2050, about half of land used for high-quality coffee will be unproductive. To find a wild coffee that tastes great and is heat and drought tolerant is \"the holy grail of coffee breeding\", said Dr Aaron Davis, head of coffee research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. \"Being somebody who's tasted a lot of wild coffees they're not great, they don't taste like Arabica so our expectations were pretty low,\" he told BBC News.  \"And we were completely blown away by the fact that this coffee tasted amazing. It has these other attributes related to its climate tolerance: it will grow and crop under much warmer conditions than Arabica coffee.\" Coffea stenophylla  is a wild coffee species from West Africa which, until recently, was thought to be extinct outside Ivory Coast. The plant was recently re-discovered growing wild in Sierra Leone, where it was historically grown as a coffee crop about a century ago. A small sample of coffee beans from Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast were roasted and made into coffee, which was then tasted by a panel of coffee connoisseurs. Over 80% of judges could not tell the difference between Stenophylla and the world's most popular coffee, Arabica, in blind tastings, the researchers reported in the journal Nature Plants. They also modelled climate data for the plant, which suggests it can potentially tolerate temperatures at least 6C higher than Arabica. Seedlings will be planted this year in order to start assessing the wild coffee's potential in safeguarding the future of high-quality coffee. Dr Davis hopes Stenophylla will one day be grown again in Sierra Leone on a major scale.  \"It's not going to be in coffee shops in the next couple of years, but I think within five to seven years we'll see it entering the market as a niche coffee, as a high value coffee, and then after that I think it will be more common,\" he said.  Arabica beans are deemed to have a superior taste. The coffee is grown in the mountains and accounts for over 60% of the world's coffee production. Arabica has limited resilience to climate change; farmers are already experiencing the impacts of elevated temperatures and low or erratic rainfall. Other threats to coffee production include price fluctuations, pests and diseases, and extreme weather. The research was carried out in collaboration with the French research institute Cirad and the University of Greenwich. The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, but only a handful are used for drinking. The global coffee industry is dominated by two main coffee crops - Arabica ( Coffea arabica ) and Robusta ( Coffeea canephora ). A third species - Liberica ( Coffea liberica ) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks. Follow Helen  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The much-loved combination of beer and crisps is being harnessed for the first time to tackle climate change. Crisps firm Walkers has adopted a technique it says will slash CO2 emissions from its manufacturing process by 70%.  The technology will use CO2 captured from beer fermentation in a brewery, which is then mixed with potato waste and turned into fertiliser. It will then be spread on UK fields to feed the following year's potato crop. Creating fertiliser normally produces high CO2 emissions, but the technology adopted by Walkers makes fertiliser without generating CO2. So, the beer-and-crisps combo performs a dual function. It stops the emission of brewery CO2 into the atmosphere \u2013 and it saves on the CO2 normally generated by fertiliser manufacture. This ingenious double whammy was developed with a grant from the UK government by a 14-employee start-up called CCm. The fertiliser was trialled on potato seed beds this year, and next year Walkers will install CCm equipment at its Leicester factory to prepare for its 2022 crop. A decision has not yet been made on which brewery Walkers will work with on this. The new technology adds to carbon-saving techniques already under way. This video can not be played The firm has installed an anaerobic digester, which feeds potato waste to bacteria to produce useful methane. The methane is burned to make electricity for the crisp-frying process \u2013 so this saves on burning fossil fuel gas. The new system will go a step further by taking away potato \u201ccake\u201d left after digestion - and stirring the brewery CO2 into it to make an enriched fertiliser which will help put carbon back into the soil as well as encouraging plant growth. It\u2019s an example of scientists finding ways to use CO2 emissions which otherwise would increase the over-heating of the planet. The CCm Technologies falls into the industrial category of Carbon Capture and Usage (CCU). Related inventions are already being harnessed in novel ways to create fuels, polymers, fertilisers, proteins, foams and building blocks. CCU is currently at a tiny scale, though - partly because the technologies are new, and partly because production of waste CO2 from society vastly outweighs demand for it. CCU is a sister technology to the better-established Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which catches emissions from chimneys, compresses them and pumps them into underground rocks where they can\u2019t heat the climate. The prime minister is keen on CCS, which can be used on a large scale. Katy Armstrong, manager of the Carbon Utilisation Centre at Sheffield University, previously told BBC News: \u201cWe need products for the way we live - and everything we do has an impact. \"We need to manufacture our products without increasing CO2 emissions, and if we can use waste CO2 to help make them, so much the better.\u201d Many of the young carbon usage firms are actually carbon-negative: that means they take in more CO2 than they put out. These firms are pioneers in what\u2019s known as the circular economy, in which wastes are turned into raw materials. The EU is trying to prompt all industries to adopt this principle, because firms will need to emit zero emissions by 2050. Walkers brand owner, PepsiCo, is looking to extend the CCm project by feeding oats and corn with the \u201ccircular\u201d fertiliser. David Wilkinson from PepsiCo\u2019s said: \u201cThis innovation could provide learnings for the whole of the food system, enabling the agriculture sector to play its part in combating climate change. \u201cThis is just the beginning of an ambitious journey, we\u2019re incredibly excited to trial the fertiliser on a bigger scale and discover its full potential.\u201d CCm says it produces CO2-based fertiliser at roughly the same price as the conventional product. CO2 from the production of conventional fertilisers has been a large factor in keeping emissions from agriculture static as most other emissions across society have been falling. Peter Hammond from CCm told BBC News: \u201cThere has been an increase in public awareness that we should get something done about the climate \u2013 and lot of baby steps have come together to make something significant. \u201cThe key challenge for us as a business wasn\u2019t getting down the cost \u2013 it was marketing the fertiliser. This link with PepsiCo takes care of that for us.\u201d PepsiCo has a mixed record on the environment. It has long been among the leaders in tackling carbon emissions, and it recently committed to eliminating all virgin plastic from its bottles sold in nine European states by 2022. But  a recent survey from by the Break Free From Plastic Campaign  ranked it second highest (after Coke) in the amount of plastic pollution it creates. Some environmentalists consider Pepsi to be among the symbols of the throwaway culture, with its plastic waste found in 43 countries.

{"id":null,"body":" Switzerland's policy on fighting climate change has been thrown into doubt after voters rejected key measures in a popular vote. A referendum saw voters narrowly reject the government's plans for a car fuel levy and a tax on air tickets.  The measures were designed to help Switzerland meet targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Many voters appear to have worried about the impact on the economy as the country tries to recover from Covid-19. Opponents also pointed out that Switzerland is responsible for only 0.1% of global emissions, and expressed doubts that such policies would help the environment.  The vote, under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, went 51% against, 49% in favour.  The Swiss government wants to bring emissions down to half of 1990 levels by 2030. Two more national votes on environmental issues were also defeated, though the results were expected.  By Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Bern The no-vote to limiting emissions is a huge shock. The Swiss government drafted this law carefully. The plan: to cut greenhouse gases to half their 1990 levels by 2030, using a combination of more renewables and taxes on fossil fuels.  Voter rejection undermines Switzerland's entire strategy to comply with the Paris Agreement. Today's results are a devastating blow for environmentalists. Some analysts suggest the Swiss - who traditionally pride themselves on their green policies - are nervous about taking any economic risks while the country recovers from the pandemic.  Now the government must go back to the drawing board, as Switzerland falls behind its European neighbours in efforts to tackle climate change.  A proposal to outlaw artificial pesticides, and another to improve drinking water by giving subsidies only to farmers who eschew chemicals were both voted down by 61%.  Supporters had pointed to worrying levels of pesticides in water, and damage to plants, animals and insects. But Swiss farmers warned the proposals would put many of them out of business. This video can not be played Voting also took place on other initiatives: anti-terrorism legislation and emergency Covid-19 funding. Plans to give the police greater powers to combat terrorism, and an extension of funding for businesses affected by Covid were approved.  Switzerland's system of direct democracy means all major decisions in the Alpine nation are taken at the ballot box. Campaigners simply have to gather 100,000 signatures to ensure a nationwide vote.

{"id":null,"body":"The world's most powerful defence alliance agreed on Monday to step up efforts to tackle climate change for the first time.  Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - said its members have pledged to \"significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from military activities\" in a way that does not impact personnel safety or the effectiveness of their operations. In a  statement released after a summit in Brussels , the group also asked the organisation's leader to develop a realistic, ambitious and concrete target for reducing Nato emissions and to assess the feasibility of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The statement described climate change as \"one of the defining challenges of our times\". It said Nato wanted to be a leading international force in understanding and adapting to the ways climate change will impact world security. Nato is a powerful political and military alliance between 30 European and North American countries. It is no secret that militaries use arsenals of gas-guzzling equipment - like armoured vehicles and aircraft - which are sometimes hauled along with troops around the world. But getting accurate data on their environmental impact is notoriously difficult.  A report commissioned by some members of the European Parliament earlier this year said that because  militaries are often exempt from publicly reporting their greenhouse gas emissions , it can be difficult to accurately measure how big their environmental impact is.  One study published in 2019 suggested that if the US military were a country, it would rank as the 47th largest emitter in the world on fuel usage alone. But this is not a uniquely US issue.  The International Military Council on Climate and Security (IMCCS) says in its latest annual report that defence remains the single largest consumer of hydrocarbons - like fuel and gas - in the world. In Monday's statement  Nato said it would develop a \"mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations\" , which could help set \"voluntary goals\" to try and reduce these emissions.  Reuters news agency, previewing Monday's announcement, pointed out that some Nato allies are already trying to make their armed forces greener by using energy sources like solar power. The International Military Council on Climate and Security - a separate group of senior military leaders - said  in its annual report  that the long life-span of military equipment, such as warships, means that defence has locked itself into relying on fossil fuels for \"many years to come\". \"This is why it is imperative that we start now by investing massively into research and development of carbon neutral fuels and propulsion systems for military vehicles on land, sea, and air,\" the 2021 report stated, pointing out any advancements in technology could also have benefits for civilian sectors, like aviation, too.  There is growing awareness of the challenges that climate change may pose to the world's security. Climate change is associated with an increase in extreme weather events like heatwaves, flooding and droughts - which often require humanitarian assistance and can cause mass displacement. Experts say environmental changes from climate change can also act as \"threat multipliers\" - intensifying existing tensions over resource scarcity or sparking regional destabilisation and conflicts. The UN Refugee Agency says that weather events are already displacing about 20 million people a year on average. This video can not be played For Nato members, extreme weather could also risk the welfare of their military personnel abroad, or the integrity of their operations and equipment.  \"Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations,\" the Nato statement said.  There is increased public awareness about the dangers and risks of climate change and scrutiny of the way governments are responding to it.  The G7 this week also agreed to new climate measures  ahead of COP26 - the latest UN Climate Change Conference - being held in Scotland later this year. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is personally passionate about the subject, having previously served as an environment minister in Norway and as a UN special envoy on climate change. He has been publicly pushing the organisation to prioritise climate change for some time.  \"As the planet heats up, our weather becomes wilder, warmer, windier and wetter, putting communities under pressure as sources of food, fresh water and energy are threatened,\" he wrote in an opinion piece in September. \"We can see this today in the Sahel region of Africa, where climate change is driving migration. In the Arctic where as the ice melts, geopolitical tensions heat up. Or here in Europe, where record-breaking floods and wildfires increase year on year.\" Monday's statement also comes after a big ideological shift in the White House, which is Nato's biggest financial contributor. Donald Trump was openly sceptical of both US support of Nato and global efforts to combat climate change but his replacement, President Joe Biden, has made both much more central to his policies. After he took office,  President Biden almost immediately reversed a decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement  and issued an executive order to tackle the climate crisis at home and abroad, including in the areas of foreign policy and national security.

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales Environment Correspondent This video can not be played Lives and livelihoods are at risk if Wales does not do more to prepare for a hotter, wetter future, government advisers say. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) said current plans to protect people, infrastructure and wildlife \"will not be sufficient\". It comes despite warnings in a series of reports by the CCC since 2011. The Welsh government said climate change was \"at the heart\" of its decision making. Of the 61 risks identified by the CCC in its latest assessment of the impact of climate change in the UK, \"more action\" is needed in Wales to address 32 of them. Twenty six of the risks have increased in urgency since  the last report in 2016 . They include threats to the viability of coastal communities from sea level rise, flooding and erosion, people's health from overheating in their homes, roads and railways from extreme weather and lightning, and wildlife across land and sea. It is getting warmer and sunnier - but wetter and wilder too. Since the mid 1970s Wales has seen an increase in average annual temperatures of 0.9C, with a 6.1% rise in average sunshine hours. The report forecasts a rise of between 1.3 and 2.3C in annual temperatures here by the 2080s, depending on how successful the world is at cutting out the gases driving climate change. It means hotter, drier summers with more extreme heatwaves - something we are already starting to experience. Rainfall is expected to decrease in summer by approximately 15% by the 2050s and by up to 26% by the 2080s - leading to potential droughts. By contrast, we are likely to have much wetter winters, exacerbating flooding issues. Sea levels are also rising - with predictions in the report they could be between 22 (8.6in) and 28cm (11in) higher in Cardiff by the 2050s and between 43 (17in) and 76cm (30in) by the 2080s - once again depending on global efforts.   Disruption to transport and IT infrastructure from fluctuating temperatures, wildfires and flooding could potentially impact \"hundreds of thousands of people annually\". The report warns of \"cascading risks\" if power supplies are affected too, given Wales, like the rest of the UK, will be heavily reliant on electricity for everything from heating to transport. Heat-related deaths in Wales could increase from 2.4 per 100,000 people a year in 2016 to 6.5 per 100,000 by the 2050s. The report says measures to prevent overheating in people's homes is a \"major policy gap\" across all UK nations. On sea level rise, there is \"little evidence\" Welsh government and local authorities are taking a strategic approach to identifying communities that may be at risk of losing homes and amenities and supporting them. But the report does point to  Fairbourne in Gwynedd  as an example for the rest of the UK of where a plan is being put in place with the community. This video can not be played Just over 10,000 properties are at risk from coastal flooding in Wales at present, this could increase \"by 260%\" by the 2080s - while 2,126 properties are likely to be at risk of coastal erosion where defences are not maintained. And 148,000 people live in areas of significant flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water. While acknowledging \"considerable advances\" have been made on managing flood risk since 2016, the CCC concluded more action was needed given the scale of the threat - including tackling continued development on flood plains. The problems that could be caused by landslides and subsidence in ex mining areas is a particular concern for Welsh communities, it said. It said \"urgent action\" is needed to enhance surveillance of tree disease in Wales, with climate change thought to be contributing to a rise in the spread of pests and pathogens such as ash dieback. We could face big problems if trees, peatlands and other natural habitats are allowed to suffer as they are a vital way of soaking up carbon dioxide and avoiding even worse effects from global warming. \"We're seeing the climate change now, it's no longer a future issue,\" said Kathryn Brown, the CCC's head of adaptation. \"Welsh government will need to look at all of the risks and think carefully about how to enhance its policies but also take urgent action in the next two years in the priority areas.\" Prof Andrew Flynn who specialises on climate adaptation at Cardiff University's school of geography and planning said it was an issue which \"tends to get left behind\". \"So much of the focus is on how can we reduce those carbon emissions - which is obviously hugely important,\" he said. \"But adapting to climate change is equally worthy of attention and matters a lot to people in the communities where they live.\" Prof Flynn said the Welsh government had a tradition of being \"innovative\" on the environment and sustainability which meant it had a \"good base to build on\". How communities are told about and consulted on the threats and opportunities climate change might pose in their areas should be one priority, he said. \"This is not simply a case of developing new policies - it's about recognising the scale of the challenge that we face.\" Wales' climate change minister has welcomed the report from the CCC and said environment and climate change was \"at the heart of our decision making\".  \"To help limit further climate change we need to do more to tackle emissions in the next 10 years than we have in the last 30,\" said Julie James MS. The minister said its plan for climate change was already in the second year of being delivered, and the new advice \"will enable us to review and update our actions in light of the latest science\". Welsh Conservative spokeswoman on climate change Janet Finch-Saunders called the report \"alarming\". \"Two years ago, in the wave of publicity driven by the antics of Extinction Rebellion, Labour declared a 'climate change emergency', but have done very little since to tackle the crisis,\" she said. \"Twenty-six of the risks have increased in urgency since the last report by the CCC, and if the current Welsh government fails to act to slow climate change, it is our children, grandchildren and future generations who will be forced to pay the price.\" UK warned it is unprepared for climate chaos Sea-threatened villagers call for answers Wales 'needs more climate change plans' Calls for UK to fund flood relief in south Wales Climate Change Committee Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Exhausted delegates have concluded three weeks of virtual climate negotiations with little progress on key issues.  The  UN subsidiary bodies meeting  was meant to clear the decks ahead of the  major COP26  gathering in Glasgow in November.  But technical glitches, and multiple time zones scuppered attempts to find common ground. Ministers from 40 countries will meet in July to push the process forward.  Developing nations are also concerned that a lack of vaccines may limit their ability to take part in the Glasgow conference.  But the UK says it will ensure all accredited delegates will get their jabs ahead of the summit.  Thanks to the pandemic, this virtual gathering was the first significant meeting of UN negotiators since December 2019, when COP25 ended in Madrid. That meeting had  failed to find a way forward  on a number of important technical questions including the role of carbon markets in curbing climate change.  Despite an extended session that ran for three weeks of talks, these important issues have still not been resolved.  The challenges of delegates in differing time zones with varying internet connections made these difficult negotiations a real struggle.  \"I think this was technically challenging for many parties, connectivity problems compounded and complicated the trust deficits that exist,\" said Quamrul Chowdhury, a climate negotiator from Bangladesh. \"Even the low hanging fruits couldn't be harvested,\" he told BBC News.  As well as the technical challenges, there were issues with access for observers with China objecting to their presence at talks on transparency. With little movement from the negotiators, it will require ministerial intervention to push the process forward. \"The past three weeks have made one thing very clear - the most dangerous stumbling blocks on the road to COP26 are political, not technical,\" said Jennifer Tollmann, a senior policy advisor at environmental think-tank E3G. \"Parties know each others' positions, it's the will to find compromise options that drive ambition that's frequently missing.\" The technical challenges mean there is a strong appetite among delegates for face to face talks in Glasgow.   However the question of Covid-19, especially in developing countries is a key issue of concern for many. \"Covid-19 remains a serious concern for many of us, and travel restrictions continue for many countries,\" said Ambassador Diann Black-Layne of Antigua and Barbuda, who is a lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.  \"A significant portion of our membership face onerous travel restrictions regardless of their personal vaccination status. Some islands in the Pacific have just two flights per month, with one month of quarantine, while other islands still have closed borders. This will not change unless their entire populations have vaccine access.\"  But UK minister Alok Sharma, who will chair the global gathering, told a news conference that delegates unable to get jabs from their own countries \"will get support from us\". Details are still being worked out in discussions with the UN, according to Mr Sharma.  The incoming COP president says that he hopes to speed up the climate talks process by hosting a ministerial meeting in London in July with representatives from about 40 countries.  Across all these meetings, one issue keeps coming to the surface and that's the question of finance. The richer nations have promised $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020.  The developed world has still not succeeded in raising that total.  \"History will not be kind to rich nations if they do not step up and fulfil their climate action commitments,\" said Harjeet Singh, with climate campaign group Climate Action Network International. \"We are already at a point where the world faces multiple crises, and the reality is that the rich world are offering a bandage when surgery is needed.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Catherine Evans BBC News With new homes being built with eco-friendly design in mind, older properties can prove the worst offenders when it comes to their carbon footprint. But making alterations to your existing home can be costly, running into hundreds or even thousands of pounds. So, how can homeowners make their properties kinder to the environment while keeping costs down? We spoke to the Welsh government and Energy Saving Trust to find out. All homes have the potential to become more energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions. The Energy Saving Trust's head of UK energy Laura McGadie said the first step in cutting carbon emissions - and bills - was to take control of your heating.  \"Make sure you understand your heating controls and set them to only heat the rooms you need, when you need them, and not above the required temperature,\" she said. \"To do this effectively, you will need a decent set of heating controls which, for most central heating systems, includes a timer or programmer, a room thermostat and thermostatic radiator valves. Fitting and using these properly could save you \u00a375 a year on your bills and reduce your carbon emissions by 320kg.\" For a quick and cost-effective improvement, insulate any exposed hot water pipes, along with your hot water cylinder if you have one.  Around a third of heat in an insulated home is lost through the walls, according to the Energy Saving Trust.  Most homes in the UK have either solid walls, which can be insulated from the inside or outside, or cavity walls, which have a gap that can be filled with insulation.  Installing solid-wall insulation could save a gas-heated, semi-detached home around 930kg of carbon dioxide emissions a year. The Welsh government said changes should be tailored to each home.  \"The changes are likely to be a mixture of improvements to the building fabric (better insulation), changes to the heating systems (low carbon heat system), together with energy storage and renewable energy generation such as batteries and solar PV,\" said a spokesperson. \"The electricity supplied by the grid is becoming more environment-friendly every day as additional renewable generation increases. This in turn makes homes greener when using that electricity.  \"Choosing a green energy supply or a flexible low-carbon tariff is a simple step towards greening your home.\" The costs of reducing your home's carbon footprint can vary from a few pounds for better draught proofing or using low-energy lightbulbs, to hundreds of pounds for loft insulation or a larger investment of thousands of pounds for renewable generation such as whole-house insulation systems. Schemes are available to support lower income households meet the cost of home energy efficiency improvements, such as the Welsh Government's Warm Homes Programme.  This has led to more than 61,400 lower-income households improving their home energy efficiency, reducing fuel bills and carbon emissions.  Welsh households can also benefit from the UK government's Energy Company Obligation Scheme, which provides insulation and low-carbon heating to lower income households.     Some eco-friendly changes to homes, such as solar panels and external heat pumps, have been criticised as being bulky, ugly or noisy. So how can homeowners make their house more energy efficient without compromising on style?  A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"Using a whole-house survey as the basis for any decisions, the range of potential measures would be identified that work for that house.  \"The homeowner would use the suggested measures that worked best for them to achieve energy efficiency and acceptable aesthetics.\" Currently, 22% of the UK's carbon emissions come from our homes, with three quarters of this coming from our heating.  According to the Welsh government, energy efficiency improvements would reduce bills and make properties both more affordable for the current occupants and potentially more attractive for those in the future. On average, households benefitting from improvements under the Warm Homes Programme have reduced their annual household fuel bills by an estimated \u00a3280. Smart heating controls offer more options for managing home heating systems and are available for all types of heating, including electric storage heating.  Some systems include advanced features, such as automation, to help determine exactly when to turn the heating on and off, saving on energy use. This video can not be played Homes can lose heat through gaps around windows and doors, floorboards or through chimneys, which tends to occur more often in older properties. Draught-proofing these areas can be an easy and cost-effective way to save energy and reduce costs. \"Quick and simple DIY solutions include fitting foam strips, plastic seals or brushes around doors and windows,\" said Ms McGadie.  For a quick easy and cheap fix, gaps between floors and skirting boards can be sealed with sealant bought from any DIY store or online. Professional draught-proofing could cost around \u00a3200, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST).  One of the best ways to cut bills is to generate your own electricity, said Ms McGadie. Solar electric panels, also known as photovoltaics (PV), allow you to generate your own renewable electricity. Although a south-facing, unshaded roof is the most effective, others can still benefit. A roof area of around 20 square metres could generate as much electricity as you use, averaged out over the year, says the EST.  Solar panels will typically cut your electricity bills by between 15% and 35% and you can earn extra by selling surplus electricity back to the grid.  To maximise your savings, you could install a battery to store your solar-generated energy to use in the evening.  But the costs of installation are high, with solar panels costing an average of \u00a35,940 in the UK, according to government data released earlier this year. Simple draught-proofing and insulation measures would not need permission, but for any major changes, such as external wall insulation, you will probably need planning permission from your local council and need to tell your insurers. There are restrictions on solar panels to minimise the effect on the appearance of the building and the amenity of the area.  According to the Welsh government, to reduce their visibility \"they should not be installed above the ridgeline of a roof and should not project more than 200mm from the surface of a roof or wall\". Panels on listed buildings need planning permission and are likely to need an application for listed building consent. A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"In a conservation area, or in a World Heritage Site, planning consent is required when panels are to be fitted on the principal or side elevation walls and are visible a highway.  \"If panels are to be fitted to a building in your garden or grounds, they should not be visible from the highway. \"On a flat roof, solar panels cannot be sited within a metre of the external edge of the roof; or protrude more than a metre above the plane of the roof.\" In Wales, the Optimised Retrofit Programme aims to make more than 1,700 homes more energy efficient. It has been trialling a combination of building fabric improvements and low and zero-carbon technologies such as solar panels, battery storage and heat pumps, to see what difference this makes to a home's energy use. Minister for Climate Change Julie James said: \"This scheme is essential to tackling climate change and driving down household energy costs now and in the future. Helping people, including those on lower incomes, to reduce their fuel bills while keeping their homes warm.\" Plans to protect the environment delayed again Clean energy to power all new homes from 2025 Energy prices to rise for millions of households How to save money working from home this winter Wales' woodlands 'facing catastrophe' Bid to scrap Wales' farming pollution rules fails New laws demand to halt mass extinction in Wales Natural resources used at 'unsustainable rate' Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say. Cattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet. It says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change. People should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists. The CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets. Its report says the PM's \"remarkable\" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy. A government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy.  Net zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees. But the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are: Sales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost. Committee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise. Frequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained. People will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly. The report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too. The committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are \"remarkable decisions\". He added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations. \"The trouble,\" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly.\" The CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was \"very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions\". His report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy. It urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: \"The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly. \"It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts.\" A government spokesman said: \"Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country. \"We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future. \"In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, \u00a35.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier. \"Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change.\" This video can not be played But environmental group Friends of the Earth said: \"The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air. \"With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting].\" The CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a \"net zero test\" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets. But there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy. Mr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill.  All these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy. Some key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's \"green revolution\".  It is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account another  recent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impact  of a heating climate on the UK.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A large facility capable of extracting significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the air is being planned for north east Scotland.  The proposed plant would remove up to one million tonnes of CO2 every year - the same amount taken up by around 40 million trees.  The extracted gas could be stored permanently deep under the seabed off the Scottish coast. But critics argue that technology isn't a magic bullet for climate change.  This Direct Air Capture (DAC) plan is a joint project between UK firm  Storegga  and Canadian company  Carbon Engineering .  It's at a very early stage of development - today's announcement is the beginning of the engineering and design of the plant.  A feasibility study has already been carried out and if everything goes well, the facility would be operational by 2026.  Storegga say up to 300 jobs would be created in the construction phase. However there are many hurdles, including planning and finance - and a site for the plant won't be selected until next year.  If it does go ahead it would be the biggest DAC facility in Europe and depending on the final configuration, could be the biggest in the world.  According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), if the world wants to stay safe, then the rise in global temperatures needs to be kept below 1.5C by the end of this century. There's not much wiggle room left: in 2020  temperatures were already 1.2C above the historical level .  To keep the mercury down, we need to curb the emissions of the warming gases that are driving them up.  The IPCC says that rapid cuts in carbon from cars, home heating and almost every aspect of our lives will be needed over the next decade.  Even then, say the scientists, the world will still need to suck significant amounts of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to stay below the 1.5C threshold.  While planting trees is one important approach to this problem, technology is also being used to capture CO2 directly from the air.  \"Even if all the other measures that we're taking to avoid emissions, electric cars, renewable energy, those types of things, even if those succeed, you still need carbon removal,\" said Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering.  \"Direct air capture I think is going to be a significant part of the UK is net zero plan.\" \"For us a typical facility is about a million tonnes of CO2 removal per year. That's the equivalent of 40 million trees.\" Canadian company Carbon Engineering is one of the leaders in this field.  At their pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, they've been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015, pulling down around 1 tonne of CO2 every day. Their system involves a fan to suck in air, which is then exposed to a liquid mixture that binds the carbon dioxide.  Through further refinement, the liquid is turned into calcium carbonate pellets.  This video can not be played When these are treated at temperature of about 900C, the pellets decompose into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide. That stream of pure CO2 is cleaned up to remove water impurities. At that point it can be pumped underground and buried permanently, sold for commercial use or even turned into liquid fuel. Right now the plan is for Carbon Engineering licence their technology to UK firm Storegga, who will be responsible for choosing the site and building the facility. According to both companies involved, north east Scotland has significant advantages for this type of technology.  They point to the fact that there is abundant renewable energy sources, there's a skilled workforce from the North Sea oil industry that have the type of skills needed to build and operate a DAC facility. But a key advantage are pipelines going out under the sea to allow the permanent burial of the captured carbon. \"We're keen to locate the plant as close as possible to transport and storage infrastructure so we don't actually have to suffer more and more costs to move captured carbon offshore and then underground,\" said Alan James from Storegga.  Carbon Engineering has received significant investment from fossil fuel companies in the past and is working closely with one firm on the development of a DAC plant in Texas.  Oil companies are keen on good quality CO2 because they can use it to flush out extra oil from depleted wells.  That's not the plan for Scotland according Alan James from developers Storegga. \"I came out of the oil industry in 2007, largely because I was getting concerned about what the impact was,\" he told BBC News. \"None of the emissions that we take out here will be used for extracting more hydrocarbons. That's not what our business now is about. We have nothing to do with producing hydrocarbons, period.\" Scientists say that DAC, if deployed widely, will have major impacts on energy, water and land use. By 2050,  according to this report from last year , food crop prices could rise more than five-fold in some parts of the world. Some people are also worried that if direct air capture becomes economically viable, then governments might start to go easy on cutting emissions.  However, supporters of DAC say that's not the case - they argue that for sectors that are hard to cut, including shipping, aviation and the oil and gas industry, then DAC is a good option for limiting their impact on the climate.  Researchers who've studied these emerging technologies say it would be foolish to rely fully on them and neglect the basic steps of decarbonising power, transport and industry. \"It's a much more sensible strategy to treat these technologies as a really nice addition, we should work hard on them and make sure that they can become cost competitive, and economic in the 2020s,\" said Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. \"But at the same time, we need to just make sure we reduce emissions as fast as possible as far as possible. So that if DAC does come along, then then that's great. That's a really nice addition to our toolkit if you like, but we definitely don't rely on them.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent There's likely to be a significant increase in the number of lawsuits brought against fossil fuel companies in the coming years, say researchers.  Their  new study  finds that to date, lawyers have failed to use the most up-to-date scientific evidence on the cause of rising temperatures.  As a result, there have been few successful claims for compensation. That could change, say the authors, as evidence linking specific weather events to carbon emissions increases.  So far, around 1,500 climate-related lawsuits have been brought before the courts around the world.  There have been some notable successes for environmental groups, such as in a  recent case against Shell  decided by a civil court in the Netherlands. The judge ruled that, by 2030, the company must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels. The verdict also indicated that the Shell group is responsible for its own CO2 emissions and those of its suppliers. However, there have been few successes in cases where the plaintiffs have sought compensation for damages caused by climate change linked to human activity. This new study has assessed some 73 lawsuits across 14 jurisdictions and says that the evidence presented to the courts lagged significantly behind the most recent climate research. Over the past two decades, scientists have attempted to demonstrate the links between extreme weather events and climate change, which are in turn connected to human activities such as energy production and transport.  These studies, called attribution science, have become more robust over the years.  For example, researchers  have been able to show  that climate change linked to human activities made the European summer heatwave in 2019 both more likely and more intense.  A  recent paper  on Hurricane Sandy - the deadly storm that wreaked havoc from the Caribbean to New York in 2012 - showed that climate change was responsible for about 13% of the $62bn in losses caused by the event.  If peer-reviewed evidence like this was presented to the courts, the authors say, it would be easier to prove causality and make compensation claims more likely to succeed.  \"Despite the clear role for attribution science evidence in these lawsuits, we found that the evidence submitted and referenced in these cases still lags considerably behind the state-of-the-art in climate science,\" said Rupert Stuart-Smith, the study's lead author and a PhD student at Oxford University. \"Crucially, we found that this is, in fact, impeding these causal claims.\" \"If some of these cases are successful, and the courts see a plausible route to justice or a plausible route to compensation, that would increase the likelihood that more and more communities will turn to the courts.\" Sophie Marjanac, from the environmental law group ClientEarth, told BBC News: \"As this science improves, the boards of individual fossil fuel companies should be preparing for their day in court, to respond to charges that they are to blame for increased natural disasters and disruptions to the planet's climate stability. \"And as this trend continues, we will also need to see courtrooms keep pace with the work of attribution scientists, so that their judgements are in line with the latest scientific evidence.\" Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya's case against the German energy giant RWE has been ongoing since 2014. Mr Lliuya claims that rising temperatures are melting a glacier, threatening his home in Huaraz, in the west of the country, with flooding.  The farmer has spent thousands of dollars trying to stem the waters to little avail. His case for compensation of around $17,000 was based on RWE being responsible for around 0.5% of global warming. While many experts believed the case was weak, in 2017, the courts in Germany recognised that there was merit to the questions that the farmer was raising. Rupert Stuart-Smith commented: \"That case has got further than any other before it on compensation, and it's now in an evidentiary phase where the court has essentially asked the question, is climate change really doing this?\" \"And our suggestion is that plaintiffs can answer those questions in their submission to the courts.\" The researchers point to the example of the link between smoking and lung cancer. The solid, scientific evidence was eventually accepted by the courts and the tobacco industry paid huge amounts in compensation as a result. Oil, gas and coal producers are aware of these legal moves to use the most advanced science to prove responsibility - they are likely to do everything in their power to resist them.  \"There's increasing concern within the fossil fuel industry, and among investors, that these cases seem to have merit and have a chance of success and the risk perception of investors in the fossil fuel industry could quite rapidly change [so that] emissions could become seen as liabilities,\" said Rupert Stuart-Smith. \"That could change the game in terms of understanding whether or not it makes sense to continue to dump carbon in the atmosphere, if doing so causes risk for your company.\" The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Shaimaa Khalil Australia correspondent In my first week as the BBC's new Australia correspondent in 2019, a state of emergency was declared in New South Wales. Bushfires blazed and came very close to Sydney. The orange haze and the smell of smoke will forever be etched in my memory. As the country woke to pictures of red skies, destroyed homes and burned koalas in smouldering bushland, the climate change debate came to the fore. But this wasn't a scientific debate. It was political and it was partisan. Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not answer questions about the issue, while then Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack dismissed climate concerns as those of \"raving inner-city lefties\".  That was my other big memory of my first week in Australia. The leadership - after years of drought and as blazes raged across the east coast - openly throwing doubt on the effects of climate change. This was a tussle at the heart of Australian politics. Climate change is a hotly charged issue here. It draws in the powerful fossil fuel industry and regional voters fearful for their livelihoods. It's a subject that has ended political careers.  Throughout those months of the Black Summer fire season, Mr Morrison would face fierce criticism about how his government handled the situation - and how it continued to avoid the climate crisis. The science around climate change is complex but it's clear. Yes, it was not the cause of any individual fire but experts agree it played a big role in creating catastrophic fire conditions; a hotter, drier climate contributed to the bushfires becoming more frequent and more intense. An inquiry following the Black Summer fires said further global warming is inevitable over the next 20 years - and Australians should prepare for more extreme weather. Still, Australia's government refuses to pledge net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This refers to balancing out any emissions produced by industry, transport or other sources by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. In his address to US President Joe Biden's climate conference in April, the prime minister said Australia will \"get there as soon as we possibly can\". \"For Australia, it is not a question of if, or even by when, for net-zero but, importantly, how,\" Mr Morrison said.   That is at the heart of the problem. The \"when\" is as crucial as the \"how\" when it comes to climate change. Scientists and global leaders say Australia is not doing enough, and not going fast enough. The country is embracing new green technologies, but that's often spearheaded by a frustrated private sector in the absence of central leadership. \"You have many businesses banding together and taking matters into their own hands,\" says Dr Simon Bradshaw, researcher at the Climate Council, an independent advisory group. \"Almost all of Australia's states and territories are committed to net zero emissions by 2050. It's really just that vacuum of leadership at the federal level,\" he says. Dr Bradshaw says while much of the world pushes ahead with action on climate change, Australia is becoming \"increasingly isolated\". As it resists tougher emissions targets, the Morrison government also continues to invest in the fossil fuel industry. Last month it said it will fund a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales' Hunter Valley, despite experts warning the plant makes little commercial sense long- term. Mr Morrison recently told a conference of fossil fuel executives that oil and gas will \"always\" be a major contributor to the country's prosperity. If you're watching this from the outside, you'd be forgiven for being surprised. But it makes sense from a domestic political perspective.   Australia is among the world's biggest exporters of coal, iron-ore and gas. This is the bedrock of the country's wealth and its thriving economy. It's proven to be political suicide to go against that. \"The fossil fuel lobby continues to be very powerful in Australia,\" says Dr Bradshaw. With a slim majority and a looming election, Mr Morrison is aware of what a poisoned chalice climate action is here. This issue has ended the careers of leaders before him including predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, whose efforts to bring back a carbon price policy - a tax on polluting fossil fuels - led to his downfall. Mr Morrison also faces pressure from his coalition partners - the National party - and their block of voters. Many National MPs, who represent rural Australia, have been public about their opposition to the government formally embracing a net zero emissions reduction target.  While still refusing to commit to a target, Mr Morrison has said he wants Australia to achieve net zero emissions \"preferably\" by 2050. That was enough to anger the Nationals and worry their constituents especially in regional mining communities.  Part of why the politics around climate action is so toxic here is the way the narrative around it has been framed, says Australian National University climate scientist Dr Imran Ahmed.  \"The message to the people [has been] that action on climate change is a cost, not an investment,\" he says. \"It is not jobs or the environment, it is both.\" Dr Bradshaw says the country's concentrated media landscape has also shaped views around the climate emergency. \"It's been dominated by largely right wing, and conservative media, and particularly the Murdoch press that's had a heavy influence on public opinion and understanding of the climate crisis.\" For regional voters, the messaging around a transition to cleaner energy has been confusing and unconvincing at best - or a cause for fear and anxiety about their future at worst.  \"We have to be mindful of existing coal communities and the people that have jobs [in the fossil fuel industry]. \"They need to be prepared with the necessary skills to transition into the new industries,\" says Dr Ahmed. This video can not be played Mr Morrison has been adamant that \"technology not taxes\" is the way forward - knowing the backlash he would face if he were to impose carbon pricing. But scientists say technology on its own is not enough and that what is needed is a combination of all measures; reduction targets, new technology for clean energy and a carbon tax. Mr Morrison is stuck between two unrelenting pulling forces; his own party and his governing coalition partner standing firmly behind the country's fossil fuel industry - and an increased international pressure from strategic allies like the UK and the US for tougher emissions reduction targets. The first is about the prime minister's domestic political standing. The second is about Australia's standing in the world.

{"id":null,"body":"Jonathan Amos Science correspondent @BBCAmos on Twitter A new record high temperature for the Antarctic continent of +18.3C has been confirmed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It occurred on 6 February last year at Argentina's Esperanza research station.  The mark was widely reported at the time  but has now been validated by a WMO committee set up to check extreme weather data from around the globe. The same group rejected an even higher Antarctic claim for 2020 of +20.75C, \"recorded\" on Seymour Island. This again received international headlines , but the committee found the sensor set-up incorporated into a Brazilian permafrost experiment had not been properly protected from direct sunlight. Thermometers are supposed to record air temperatures inside a ventilated covering, or screen. The WMO team said that on Seymour Island this took the form of a modified length of scaffolding pipe and would likely therefore have introduced a warming bias into any data readings. Nonetheless, temperatures on the normally frigid Antarctic continent have been rising, especially along its peninsula - the great tongue of terrain that stretches north in the direction of South America. Over the last 50 years, the peninsula warmed almost three degrees. And although no official temperature recording has yet gone above +20C on the continent and its close-by islands, it's just a matter of time, says Prof John King from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). \"If you consider all the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty - that's all land south of 60 degrees South latitude - then we had a temperature of +19.8C in January 1982 on Signy Island. \"Okay, that's from the maritime Antarctic rather than the continent proper, but I wouldn't rule out seeing +20C temperatures somewhere in the northeast Antarctic Peninsula sometime within the next decade,\" the WMO extremes committee member told BBC News.       One of the drivers of the rise in temperatures is the strengthened westerlies that now blow around the continent. This powerful airflow produces warming conditions on the eastern, leeward side of the peninsula's mountainous spine.   Such warm, downslope winds are well known across the Earth, and wherever they occur they tend to have a local name. The Chinook winds that drop over the Rockies and Cascades in North America are an example of this phenomenon. In the Antarctic, they are known as Foehn winds - a title originally used in Alpine Europe. The incidence of these warmer conditions has been increasing  on the Antarctic Peninsula. The Foehn winds appear also to be moving poleward as well. \"The occurrence of Foehn winds varies greatly from year to year,\" explained Prof King. \"During the latter part of the last century, there was a strengthening and somewhat southward movement of the circumpolar westerly winds, which meant that this was probably contributing towards more intense Foehn on the eastern side of the peninsula and hence the rather rapid warming trend we saw there.  \"That strengthening trend in the westerlies eased off a bit towards the end of the 20th Century and into the first part of the 21st Century, which meant the temperature trend also eased off a bit. But I think there are now indications that this phenomenon is picking up again, and is likely to be an important contributor to future warming in the region.\" The Antarctic continent spans an area of 14 million sq km (roughly twice the size of Australia), and is covered by 26.5 million cubic km of ice. Its weather stations are sparse but average annual temperature are seen to range from about \u221210C at the coast to -60C in the highest parts of the interior.  Satellites can measure the \"skin temperature\", or the temperature \"to the touch\", of the continent and have taken readings below even -90C in places. But meteorologists are concerned with standard air temperatures and these are measured about 1.5m off the surface.  Using this definition, the coldest temperature ever recorded in the Antarctic stands at -89.2C. This occurred at the Russian Vostok station on 21 July 1983.

{"id":null,"body":"BBC Bitesize has removed references to the \"benefits\" of climate change on its website, following complaints online. The education website listed \"healthier outdoor lifestyles\" as one of the pluses of having warmer temperatures. Others included easier access to oil in Alaska and Siberia, new shipping routes created by melting ice, and more tourist destinations. Climate expert and writer George Monbiot called the list, which has now been removed, \"an absolute disgrace\". \"This is what BBC Bitesize is teaching our children about climate breakdown,\"  the Guardian journalist tweeted . \"I'm sorry, but it's an absolute disgrace.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Planting extra trees to combat climate change across Europe could also increase rainfall, research suggests. A  new study  found that converting agricultural land to forest would boost summer rains by 7.6% on average. The researchers also found that adding trees changed rainfall patterns far downwind of the new forests.  The authors believe that extra rain could partially offset the rise in dry conditions expected with climate change. The findings about increasing rainfall are partly based on observations of existing patterns. But the underlying reasons are less clear - they are probably related to the way the forests interact with cloudy air. Planting trees has become a major plank of many countries' efforts to tackle climate change all over the world.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK is aiming to plant some 30 million new trees every year by 2025. A number of studies have looked at the range of impacts, both positive and negative, that the boom in planting is likely to bring. This new paper considers the impact of converting agricultural land across Europe to sustainable forests. The authors use an observation-based statistical model to estimate how changes to forest cover would impact rainfall across the continent.  The researchers found that if there was a 20% increase in forest, uniformly across Europe, then this would boost local rainfall, especially in winter and with greater impacts felt in coastal regions.  But as well as local rain, the planting of new forests causes impacts downwind. The scientists found that rainfall in these locations was increased particularly in the summer months. Taking the two impacts together, in what the team describe as a realistic reforestation scenario, they found that precipitation overall went up by 7.6% in the summer.  That's quite a significant finding, according to lead author Ronny Meier from ETH Zurich. It also has implications for climate change.  \"Probably the most threatening climate change signal that we expect in relation to percipitation, is this decrease in summer precipitation that is expected in the southern parts of Europe like the Mediterranean,\" he told BBC News.  \"And there, according to our study, forestation would lead to an increase in precipitation. So the forestation would probably be very beneficial in terms of adapting to the adverse effects of climate change.\" But the authors also point out that the increased rainfall could have potentially negative impacts by boosting rainfall patterns that have already been affected by climate change, particularly in the Atlantic region.  The authors say that the reasons behind these local and distant impacts on rainfall are uncertain - they point out that the cloudy air that produces rain tends to stay longer over forested areas. And the rougher nature of these forests may trigger the rain. \"A forest is a much rougher surface than agricultural land,\" said Ronny Meier. \"So, it induces more turbulence at the land-atmosphere interface, and also, the forest exerts more drag on to the atmosphere than agricultural land.\" \"We think that this drag, this higher turbulence over the forests is probably the main reasons for the fact that we find more precipitation in regions with more forests.\" The new forests tend to evaporate more moisture to the atmosphere than agricultural land and this extra supply is the main reason behind increased rainfall downwind. For the authors, the fact that trees planted in one country may have implications in another means that the world should really consider all the impacts of how we use land.  It also shows once again, that the idea of solving climate change with trees is not as simple as it is often portrayed.  \"Planting trees is certainly not a quick fix for climate change,\" said Prof Wim Thiery, from the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, who was not involved in the new study.  \"Adding new trees or restoring lost forests can never compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the burning of fossil fuels. We need to stop generating those emissions in the first place.\" \"But cutting back on our emissions won't be enough: we will also need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere should we wish to stay below 1.5C of warming. From that perspective, tree planting emerges as a potential candidate for generating these negative emissions, but planting trees should never be an excuse for not acting on reducing our carbon emissions by all means possible.\" The  research has been published  in the journal Nature Geoscience.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The searing heat that scorched western Canada and the US at the end of June was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change, say scientists. In their study, the team of researchers says that the deadly heatwave was a one-in-a-1,000-year event. But we can expect extreme events such as this to become more common as the world heats up due to climate change. If humans hadn't influenced the climate to the extent that they have, the event would have been 150 times less likely. Scientists worry that global heating, largely as a result of burning fossil fuels, is now driving up temperatures faster than models predict.  Climate researchers have grown used to heatwaves breaking records all over the world in recent years. However, beating the previous national high temperature mark by more than 4C in one go, as happened in Canada last week, is virtually unprecedented.  Canada's previous national record for high temperature was 45C - but the recent heat in the village of Lytton in British Columbia saw a figure of 49.6C recorded at the height of the event.  This was shortly before the village itself was largely destroyed by a wildfire. All across the region, in the US states of Oregon and Washington and in the west of Canada, multiple cities hit new records far above 40C. These temperatures had deadly consequences for hundreds of people, with spikes in sudden deaths and big increases in hospital visits for heat-related illness.  Since the start of the heatwave, people have linked the unusual and extreme nature of the event to climate change.  Now, researchers say that the chances of it occurring without human-induced warming were virtually impossible.  An international team of 27 climate researchers who are part of the  World Weather Attribution  network managed to analyse the data in just eight days.  Unsurprisingly, given the quick turnaround, the research has not yet been peer-reviewed. However, the scientists use well-established methods accepted by top journals. They used 21 climate models to estimate how much climate change influenced the heat experienced in the area around the cities of Seattle, Portland and Vancouver.  They compared the climate as it is today, with the world as it would be without human-induced warming.  \"We conclude that a one-in-1000-year event would have been at least 150 times rarer in the past,\" said lead author Sjoukje Philip, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. \"So that's in a climate without human-induced climate change, when the climate was about 1.2C cooler than it is now. The heatwave would also have been about two degrees cooler in the past.\" Co-author Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, explained what the researchers meant when they said the extreme heat was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change.  \"Without the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in the statistics that we have available with our models, and also the statistical models based on observations, such an event just does not occur,\" she explained.  \"Or if an event like this occurs, it occurs once in a million times, which is the statistical equivalent of never,\" she told a news briefing. This type of research, which seeks to determine the contribution of human-induced climate change to extreme weather events, is known as an attribution study. According to the analysis, if the world warms by 2C, which could happen in about 20 years' time, then the chances of having a heatwave similar to last week's drop from around once every 1,000 years to roughly once every 5-10 years.  The authors say that the observed temperatures were so extreme that they lie far outside the range of historical observations. This makes it hard to quantify, with confidence, just how rare the heat dome event really was.  The scientists say there are two possibilities for the extreme jump in peak temperatures seen in the region. The first is that it is just an extremely rare event, made worse by climate change, \"the statistical equivalent of really bad luck\", according to the paper.  The other possibility is that the climate may have crossed a \"threshold,\" that would make the kind of heatwaves witnessed recently much more likely. Up until now, researchers had seen a gradual increase in heat extremes as the world warmed. Their analysis of what happened in Canada has shaken that view.   It could mean that the predictions of climate models might be underestimating the extreme temperatures the world could yet experience. \"We are much less certain about how the climate affects heatwaves than we were two weeks ago,\" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. \"And we are worried about the possibilities of these things happening everywhere. But we don't know how realistic that is yet, we just we need to work on it.\" So does mean that this exceptional heatwave could be some sort of tipping point? \"It's really not the important thing if this is a tipping point or not,\" said Dr Otto.  \"What's important is what are our societies are resilient to and what can we adapt to. And in most societies, it's really a very, very stable climate, and that even a small change makes a huge difference.\" \"And what we see here is not a small change, it's a big change. I think that is really, really the important message here.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Harriet Bradshaw BBC Scotland Climate Change reporter Glasgow is hosting the COP26 climate summit amid ongoing controversy over a new oil field west of Shetland that could get the green light by the UK government. The Cambo oil field is thought to contain 800 million barrels of oil - with climate campaigners saying it would be hypocrisy to develop the site at a time when countries across the world are being asked to take urgent action to prevent global temperatures from spiralling out of control.   The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has said that the new field should \"100%\" get the go-ahead, arguing that it would be \"foolish to think that we can just run away from oil and gas\".  The Scottish government has been accused of sitting on the fence over whether or not the development should be allowed, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon refusing to openly oppose the plans. The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of the Shetland Islands in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m.  While the UK government says the original \"licensing approval\" for the site dates back to 2001, it is important to note that licence was an exploration licence.  Before any oil or gas is discovered in a particular location, such a licence gives companies permission to seek out where it is.  An industry expert has told me that there is then a lengthy, rigorous process - which can sometimes take decades - involving the creation of field development plans, environmental statements and many other requirements which require approval from the relevant bodies, before production activity can begin. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. And the field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years.  It is this \"licensing loophole\" that is also causing concern to campaigners.  A spokesperson for the UK government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has responded to the criticisms, saying: \"While we are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee.\"  The company behind the Cambo proposal is Siccar Point Energy, backed by private equity firm investors. It sees this as an opportunity to create more than 1,000 jobs and even more in the supply chain. \"The Cambo development supports the country's energy transition, maintaining secure UK supply,\" says Jonathan Roger, the company's CEO.  \"We have proactively taken significant steps to minimise the emissions footprint through its design and Cambo will be built 'electrification-ready', with the potential to use onshore renewable power when it becomes available in the future, in line with decarbonisation targets.\" The other player is Shell, which has a 30% stake in the project. While a spokesperson told me they were unable to comment on the licence application because Shell is not the operator, they did tell me about the company's overall strategy. They said: \"Even the most ambitious scenarios tell us that as the energy system transitions, the world will continue to need oil and gas for decades to come.  \"Targeted investment will generate cash to help fund the growth of our new low-carbon portfolio.\" But the group of campaigners protesting against the proposal do not believe this sticks, with Friends of the Earth gaining thousands of signatures on their petitions. They calculate that in phase 1, emissions alone would be approximately the equivalent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 16 coal-fired power plants.  They say this contradicts a number of robust targets and recommendations to keep rising temperatures in check, including the International Energy Agency recommendations for no new oil and gas fields from 2021, except those already approved. \"The huge response to the open letter shows that the public understand that we must keep fossil fuels in the ground and switch to clean renewable energy,\" says Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner Caroline Rance. \"Both the UK and Scottish governments must end their hypocritical support for drilling for every last drop of climate-wrecking oil and gas, and instead develop a clear plan for winding down fossil fuel extraction while retraining offshore workers and supporting communities affected by this transition.\"   Virus hits plans for huge oil field development Delaying climate meeting 'preferable to failure' Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Technology can help indigenous communities to significantly curb deforestation, according to a new study.   Indigenous people living in the Peruvian Amazon were equipped by conservation groups with satellite data and smartphones. They were able to reduce tree losses by half in the first year of the project. Reductions were greater in communities facing threats from illegal gold mining, logging and drugs.  Over one-third of the Amazon rainforest lies within the territory of approximately 3,344 acknowledged indigenous communities.  But for decades, these areas have been under attack from outsiders who are determined to cut down trees for a range of purposes including mining, logging and the planting of illicit crops like the coca plants used to manufacture cocaine.  Over the past 40 years, governments and environmentalists have invested heavily in the use of satellite technology to monitor the removal of trees.  Governments in Brazil, Peru and Colombia have put in place a system of high-resolution deforestation alerts, but there is little evidence that this information reaches the indigenous communities most affected.  This new research set out to see if putting information directly into the hands of forest communities would make a difference.  In this randomised, controlled study, the authors identified 76 remote villages in the Peruvian Amazon, with 36 randomly-assigned to participate in this new monitoring programme.  Thirty-seven other communities served as a control group and continued with their existing forest management practices. Three members of each selected community were trained in the use of technology and shown how to carry out patrols to verify deforestation.  When satellite information showed suspected deforestation activity in an area, photos and GPS coordinates were loaded onto USB drives and carried up the Amazon river and delivered by couriers. The information was then downloaded onto specialised smartphone apps which would guide the community monitors to the suspected locations.  When the forest patrols confirmed any unauthorised deforestation, they would report back to a general assembly of community members to decide on the best approach.  In cases where drug dealers were involved, the community could decide to report the issue to law enforcement.  If the activity was perceived as less risky, community members could intervene directly and drive the offenders off their land.  When the researchers examined the impact of the new approach, they found that deforestation dropped by 52% in the first year, and by 21% in the second.  \"It's quite a sizeable impact,\" said Jacob Kopas, an independent researcher and an author on the paper.  \"We saw evidence of fewer instances of tree cover loss in the programme communities compared with control communities.\" \"On average, those communities managed to avert 8.8 hectares of deforestation within the first year. But the communities that were most threatened, the ones that had more deforestation in the past were the ones pulling more weight and were reducing deforestation more than in others.\" Indigenous groups welcomed the research, saying it is among the first peer-reviewed studies to show the benefits of empowering local communities.  \"The study provides evidence that supporting our communities with the latest technology and training can help reduce deforestation in our territories,\" said Jorge Perez Rubio, the president of the Loreto regional indigenous organization (ORPIO), where the study was carried out. The scale of the problem of deforestation in indigenous areas is significant. Between 2000 and 2015, around 17% of tree loss in the Amazon occurred on nationally-protected or areas assigned to indigenous peoples.  This is expected to increase in the coming years. \"Over the next decade, if nothing changes, indigenous peoples in the Amazon Basin are projected to lose 4.4 million hectares of rainforest, mostly to outsiders who encroach on their territories to cut down trees,\" says Cameron Ellis, with the Rainforest Foundation US, who helped facilitate the study. \"But if the community-based forest monitoring methodology could be widely adopted and local governance strengthened, forest loss in the Amazon could be reduced by as much as 20% across all indigenous lands.\" \"If the approach were targeted to regions with high deforestation rates, forest loss in those areas could be cut by more than three quarters.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent More than 100 developing countries have set out their key negotiating demands ahead of the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow. These include funding for poorer nations to fight and adapt to climate change and compensation for the impacts they will be subjected to. Those backing the plan represent more than half of the world's countries. Without progress on these points, they say that COP26 will be worthless and will end in failure.  COP26  in November is expected to be the most important meeting on climate change since the Paris agreement was drawn up in 2015 and there are huge expectations that it will deliver significant progress in the battle against rising temperatures.   But this new  position paper  is a warning shot from more than 100 of the world's poorer countries, which are dismayed by the lack of progress they've seen so far - particularly at the  G7 meeting in the UK in June .  They've set out five key issues which they say are critical for them in the negotiations: \"Highly vulnerable countries like Somalia are already suffering disproportionally from the impacts of climate change,\" said Mahdi M Gulaid, deputy prime minister of Somalia, one of the countries behind the plan. \"COP 26 must be a key moment of delivery and there can be no more excuses for unfulfilled promises, particularly climate finance.\" The poorer nations draw parallels with the Covid-19 pandemic. They say that a failure to deliver vaccines and debt relief after Covid, will send a signal to these countries that they will be alone when climate impacts bite harder.  \"Despite Covid understandably taking the headlines, climate change has been getting worse over the past year as emissions continue to rise and the lives and livelihoods on the front line suffer,\" said Sonam P Wangdi of Bhutan, who will chair the Least Developed Countries Group at COP26. \"COP26 needs to be a summit where we see action not words. We have enough plans: what we need is for major economies to start delivering on their promises. Our economies are suffering in the face of increased climate impacts and budgetary strains: either we invest our way out of this mess or we face a brutal decade of loss and damage.\"  In the report, the countries lay out what's termed a \"fair share accounting\", which allocates emissions cuts based on historical responsibility and the capacity to act.  Under that scenario, the US would need to reduce emissions by 195% below 2005 levels by 2030. This could be made up of a 70% cut in domestic emissions plus $80bn a year in support for developing countries.  For the UK, a similar approach would see a 70% emissions cut by 2030 plus $46bn a year in climate finance.  Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"The European Union has announced a raft of climate change proposals aimed at pushing it towards its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. A dozen draft proposals, which still need to be approved by the bloc's 27 member states and the EU parliament, were announced on Wednesday. They include plans to tax jet fuel and effectively ban the sale of petrol and diesel powered cars within 20 years. The proposals, however, could face years of negotiations. The plans triggered serious infighting at the European Commission, the bloc's administrative arm, as the final tweaks were being made, sources told the AFP news agency. \"By acting now we can do things another way... and choose a better, healthier and more prosperous way for the future,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. \"It is our generational task... [to secure] the wellbeing of not only our generation, but of our children and grandchildren. Europe is ready to lead the way.\" The measures are likely to push up household heating bills, as well as increase the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to install insulation and make other long-term changes to their homes. \"We're going to ask a lot of our citizens,\" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said. \"We're also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.\" Opposition is also expected from some industry leaders, such as airlines and vehicle manufacturers, as well as from eastern member states that rely heavily on coal. One EU diplomat told Reuters that the success of the package would rest on its ability to be realistic and socially fair, while also not destabilising the economy. \"The aim is to put the economy on a new level, not to stop it,\" they said.   The measures, billed as the EU's most ambitious plan yet to tackle climate change, have been named the Fit for 55 package because they would put the bloc on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 55% from 1990 levels. By 2019, the EU had cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels. Some of the key proposals include: But corporate lobby BusinessEurope denounced the plan, saying it \"risks destabilising the investment outlook\" for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electric power \"enormously\". And Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said: \"Aviation is committed to decarbonisation as a global industry. We don't need persuading, or punitive measures like taxes to motivate change.\" At the same time, environmentalist campaigners have said the proposals don't go far enough. \"Celebrating these policies is like a high-jumper claiming a medal for running under the bar,\" Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said in a statement. \"This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn't stand up to science, and won't stop the destruction of our planet's life-support systems.\" Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said that unless the EU \"tears up\" its proposals, \"the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating\". This video can not be played In September  the EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% reduction  by 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures. The targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The scale of this 12-pronged plan is breathtaking. It will likely have an impact on every citizen of Europe in almost every aspect of their lives. The scope is so huge because the target is so tough.  From 1990 to 2019 the EU cut carbon emissions by 24% - now it proposes to slash CO2 by another 31% in just 9 years. That's what's needed if the 2050 net-zero target is to be achieved.  So as well as boosting renewables, the EU is now set to tackle the really tough issues of home heating and transport. The proposals would see the end to new petrol and diesel cars by 2035.  Europe's emissions trading scheme will also be reformed to include heating and road transportation. Fossil fuels used in shipping and aviation will face tax rises. One of the most eye-catching proposals is a carbon border tax on goods like steel, cement and fertiliser to ensure that European industry, which has to pay for permits to use carbon, can compete. However, the proposal is contentious and could spark a trade war with China and the US. The ambitious package will now face months of negotiations with member states, with poorer countries wary of new policies that could raise costs for consumers. The commission is betting that instead of hordes of yellow-vest protesters taking to the streets, citizens will be willing to pay a price for cleaner air, lower emissions, and more sustainable lifestyles.  The rest of the world will watch this huge gamble with interest.  How bad is Nato's climate change problem?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predict the intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer.  Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science \u201cBible\u201d, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told BBC News: \"We should be alarmed because the IPCC (climate computer) models are just not good enough. \"(We need) an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes.  \"Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity\/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them.\" She said the costs of the computer, which would be in the hundreds of millions of pounds, would \"pale into insignificance\" compared with the costs of extreme events for which society is unprepared. Dame Julia is striving to promote this initiative at the COP26 climate summit in November. She, and other scientists, agree climate change is an emergency. But Oxford Prof Tim Palmer told me: \"It\u2019s is impossible to say how much of an emergency we are in because we don\u2019t have the tools to answer the question.  \"We need a commitment and vision with the magnitude of CERN (Europe's major physics research centre) if we are to build climate models that can accurately simulate the extremes of climate like the Canadian heatwave.\" Most importantly researchers need to assess whether places such as North America or Germany will face extremes like the heat dome and the floods every 20 years, 10 years, five years \u2013 or maybe even every year. This level of accuracy currently isn\u2019t possible. Some scientists argue that it's futile to wait for the IPCC to say how bad climate change will be.  That's partly because the panel's \"Bible\", which is supposed to gather in one place the sum of knowledge on climate change, will actually already be out of date when it\u2019s published because review deadlines closed before the German and American extreme extremes (sic).  Prof Bill McGuire, for instance, from UCL, told me: \"The obvious acceleration of the breakdown of our stable climate simply confirms that - when it comes to the climate emergency - we are in deep, deep s***!  \"Many in the climate science community would agree, in private if not in public. \"The IPCC's reports tend to be both conservative and consensus. They\u2019re conservative, because insufficient attention has been given to the importance of tipping points, feedback loops and outlier predictions; consensus, because more extreme scenarios have tended to be marginalised. \"Plenty of peer-reviewed papers not addressed in IPCC documentation present far more pessimistic scenarios. There is no reason why a consensus viewpoint should be right, and we need to be preparing for the worst, even if we still hope for the best.\" Cambridge Prof Mike Hulme is worried by this tone. He told me: \"It's well known that the IPCC works on a slower timescale than does the weather - and for good reason.  \"Science takes time to mature, and for uncertainties to be properly contextualised. I think it is dangerous if people start trying to undermine IPCC reports before they are even published,\" he told me.  \"Yes, there are weather extremes and some of them \u2013 like heatwaves and some hurricane intensities - are getting more extreme, but this is all predictable according to IPCC models.   \"I think it is dangerous to start banging the drum for more and more emergency talk.  \"We have seen the damage emergencies can do with the pandemic, fuelled by the psychology of fear through  the social amplification of risk .  \"It's a politically dangerous game to start playing.\"  Meanwhile, the former UK government chief scientist, Prof Sir David King, recently set up the Climate Change Advisory Group to fill the gaps he believes are left by IPCC science.   One group member, Prof Mark Maslin from UCL, said of the IPCC: \"The executive summary has to be agreed and signed off by 193 countries; reports are every 6-7 years and because of the time they take to write they are usually 1-2 years behind the literature.  \"Are they still fit for purpose - yes, as they provide an essential service linking scientists, social scientists and economists all around the world and provide the baseline estimates of what will happen to governments and companies.  \"Are they fit for dealing with a rapidly evolving climate and political landscape - No!\u201d Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent US climate envoy John Kerry has called on China to increase the speed and depth of its efforts to cut carbon. Without sufficient emissions reductions by China, Mr Kerry said, the global goal of keeping temperatures under 1.5C  was \"essentially impossible\". Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could do more and the US was willing to work closely to secure a reasonable climate future. Every major economy must now commit to meaningful reductions by 2030, he said. Mr Kerry was speaking at Kew Gardens in London, ahead of a G20 environment ministers meeting in Italy later this week.  Referring to the key COP26 gathering in Glasgow in November, the former Secretary of State said that \"in little more than 100 days we can save the next 100 years\". Doing so would not be easy he said. Mr Kerry said that the promises made during and since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 would still see the world's temperature increase by 2.5-3C. \"We're already seeing dramatic consequences with 1.2C of warming,\" he said, referring to recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, and flooding in Europe. \"To contemplate doubling that is to invite catastrophe.\" He castigated the efforts of some countries which are still building new coal-fired power stations. He was scornful of nations that are illegally cutting down the rainforest \"They're removing the lungs of the world, destroying irreplaceable biodiversity and destabilising the climate all at the same time.\" Observers say that the envoy was likely referring to Brazil and Indonesia. Mr Kerry paid special attention to the efforts of China, saying the country was now \"the largest driver of climate change\". China has promised to peak emissions by 2030 - but the US diplomat said that was not good enough. \"If China sticks with its current plant and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world must go to zero by 2040 or even 2035,\" he warned. \"There is simply no alternative because without sufficient reduction by China, the goal of 1.5C is essentially impossible. China's partnership and leadership on this issue of extraordinary international consequence is essential.\" Mr Kerry said he was convinced that China could outperform the targets it had set itself and that despite their diplomatic differences, the US was keen to co-operate. He also said all other major economies would have to step up, with more ambitious targets and plans for the next decade. Mr Kerry's comments come as new research shows that G20 countries are continuing to support fossil fuels in ways that are incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement. This video can not be played According to Bloomberg's  Climate Policy Factbook , G20 nations collectively cut fossil fuel funding by 10% from 2015 to 2019. However, eight countries, including the US, Canada and Australia increased their financial support for oil, coal and gas in this period.  Last week, Mr Kerry travelled to Moscow where both sides agreed that the climate issue is one of common interest. President Putin said that Moscow \"attaches great importance\" to achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement.  In May, Mr Kerry was  criticised by some scientists  for rejecting the idea that Americans would have to change their consumption habits, for example, eating less meat.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Planners can effectively ignore climate change when they are deciding whether to grant permission for new road schemes, environmentalists have said.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has promised a review of \u00a327bn highways policy which will be completed within two years. But in the meantime, planners can use existing guidelines. Campaigners say these ignore the cumulative effects of major road projects. They say Mr Shapps should be blocking new schemes until a new climate-friendly policy is developed. Many scientists say no new infrastructure should be built unless it is low-carbon. The debate has been raised because government policies for infrastructure were devised before ministers committed to virtually abolishing carbon emissions for the whole UK economy.  The policy debate is still catching up.  Currently guidance to planners states: \u201cAny increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse development consent, unless the increase in carbon emissions resulting from the proposed scheme are so significant that it would have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets.\u201d Campaigners say the government must take account of the cumulative climate effect of its entire roads programme \u2013 not just of individual schemes. They have been chivvying Mr Shapps for 18 months to update the roads strategy to combat the climate crisis. He has now promised to review it \u2013 but not for up to two years.  Chris Todd, from Transport Action Network, said, \"As our roads melt and places around the world face record temperatures and floods, the words \u2018climate emergency\u2019 appear to have no meaning within the Department for Transport. \u201cInstead, all we seem to get are delay, delay and yet more delay. Having now finally accepted the inevitable, Mr Shapps is still fiddling while the planet burns.\u201d Mr Todd said the test for carbon in the guidelines was \"utterly ridiculous\". \"A road scheme's emissions, however large, are never going to be significant compared to a five year carbon budget for the whole of the UK,\" he said. \"It's high time the government corrected this ludicrous state of affairs.\" However, Edmund King, AA president, said that zero emission cars will still need roads to drive on.  \u201cSo while it is correct to review the roads programme and especially the expansion of smart motorways, it is na\u00efve to think we wouldn\u2019t need to sort out the bottlenecks and dangerous hotspots.\u201d Mr King, though, also wants a  major government investment in rural broadband  to reduce the need for travel. And Mr Shapps himself says he  wants to get people out of their cars  to reduce emissions and improve health.  A government spokesman said that the Department for Transport and Highways England have both published \"ambitious plans to get to net zero highways\". \"This will see the UK rapidly cut carbon from\u202froad construction, maintenance and operations, and support the transition to zero emission vehicles - putting roads at the heart of the low carbon economy,\" a spokesperson said. Among the schemes pending approval is the Lower Thames Crossing \u2013 a massive project that campaigners complain would produce over  5 million tonnes  of carbon emissions.  Other major schemes include: The campaigners also complain that smart motorways, which allow vehicles to run on the hard shoulder, are treated as permitted development without the need for planning permission or any assessment of carbon impacts.   Emissions come from the creation of the road-building materials such as cement, as well as from petrol and diesel cars and lorries that will be using new road space.  Only last week Mr Shapps told holidaymakers they could carry on flying because technology would solve emissions from aviation. This flew in the face of a recommendation from the Climate Change Committee which says ministers must dampen the projected increase in demand for flying \u2013 as well as seeking technology solutions.

{"id":null,"body":"Israel will cut carbon emissions by 85% from 2015 levels by the middle of the century, its government says. Its prime minister said the decision would help the country gradually shift to a low-carbon economy. Targets include cutting the vast majority of emissions from transport, the electricity sector and municipal waste. But critics want more ambitious targets for renewable energy and bigger economic incentives for change. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. But Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the move would lead to a \"clean, efficient and competitive economy\" and put Israel at the forefront of the battle against climate change. Israel's targets were in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement - a legally binding international treaty on climate change adopted by nearly 200 countries. It aims to keep global temperatures below 2.0C above pre-industrial times, and if possible below 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Israel signed the Paris climate deal. It has set itself an interim goal of cutting emissions by 27% by 2030. Under President Donald Trump the US pulled out of the deal but President Joe Biden has recommitted to it.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Against a backdrop of fires and floods, researchers are meeting virtually to finalise a key climate science study. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is preparing the most comprehensive assessment on the state of global heating since 2013. Over the next two weeks, the scientists will go through their findings line by line with representatives of 195 governments.  Experts say the report will be a \"wake-up call\" to governments. It is expected that the short, 40-page Summary for Policymakers will play an important role in guiding global leaders who will come to Glasgow in November to deal with critical climate questions.  As the world has warmed over the past 30 years, the IPCC has become the most important platform for summarising the state of scientific understanding of the problem, its impacts and solutions.  This year, though, the panel's report takes places as  extreme weather events  have shaken the US and Canada, Europe and Asia. The question of the role played by human-induced climate change is being asked more loudly than ever.  Formed in 1988, the IPCC's role is to provide politicians with assessments every six or seven years on the science, the impacts and the potential options for tackling climate change.  Over the years, its reports have become more strongly worded as the evidence has mounted.  In 2013, its assessment said that  humans were the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s . That document helped set the scene for the Paris climate agreement signed in 2015.  As well as its six- or seven-year assessments, the IPCC has also produced special studies looking at specific scientific questions.  In 2018, the IPCC released a  special report on keeping global temperature rise under 1.5C .  This document has had a significant impact on an emerging generation of young people,  willing to take to the streets to demand a political response. \"The 1.5C report was really kind of instrumental for young people to use that science to marshal their efforts towards action,\" said Ko Barrett, a vice chair of the IPCC and a head of research at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). \"I think maybe the report surprised us all, that the report had such an impact in getting people to think, wow, this is not some big future problem. This is like right now.\" The IPCC's latest summary of the science, to be published on 9 August, is also likely to have a big impact.  In a couple of months, world leaders will come to Glasgow to try to advance the world's efforts against rising temperatures.  The IPCC's forthcoming report will be required reading for many attending COP26. \"I think it's going to be a wake-up call, there's no doubt about that,\" said Richard Black, an honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. \"But then again, so are some of the real world events that we're seeing around us at the moment.\" Many people think that the IPCC is just a platform for science, but that's not the full picture.  \"The IPCC itself actually consists of representatives from 195 governments in all, and they basically commission the reports from the various groups of academics that do the work,\" said Richard Black. \"And this to me is the key thing about the IPCC. It's not just a bunch of scientists producing a report; they are commissioned by governments, and they're owned by governments. And that makes them absolutely unique.\" The IPCC, while it has undoubted clout, doesn't actually conduct its own research. For its assessments, the IPCC divides the work into three different areas. The first is the physical science report, the second the study on impacts, the third is on mitigation. The impacts and mitigation studies will come out early next year, as well as a synthesis report that will pull all the threads together. For the upcoming publication on the physical science, more than 200 researchers been working together in groups to review the existing peer-reviewed literature over the last four years. Their initial draft reports were subject to discussions and comments from fellow researchers and from governments.  The new study attracted around 75,000 comments as it was drafted and re-written. Over the next two weeks, a final Summary for Policymakers, running to around 40 pages, will be agreed word by word with government representatives.  \"The scientists come in with a proposal document that line by line gets challenged by the representative of the United Nations there, and the scientists defend their lines,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia who has been involved with two previous IPCC assessment reports. \"Nothing gets written that is not scientifically correct. So, scientists have the right to just say this is wrong, and the documents gets really strong at the end because of that process.\" One of the things that gives the report additional muscle is the fact that it is not just one particular research paper on one topic  - the reviewers consider all the pieces of research carried out on each area of focus.  \"Sometimes the IPCC gets criticised for being focussed on consensus, and it's suggested that that can weaken statements,\" said Dr Emily Shuckburgh, from the University of Cambridge. \"But the fact that it is a summary across multiple lines of evidence is incredibly powerful and incredibly useful.\" As in previous assessments, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis.  In the last report in 2013, the authors said that warming since the 1950s was \"extremely likely\" due to human activities.  This will likely be further strengthened, despite the objections of some countries. \"It's going to revise this overall attribution statement. Obviously, it is going to be stronger than what we had in the past because of the growing warming of the planet,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. \"That's going to be one of the main points. It will be discussed very, very carefully, and scrutinised. You can be sure it will be scrutinised by governments.\" However, many participants are likely to be more concerned with the present and the future than questions of past responsibility.  There will be a new chapter on weather and extreme events in a changing climate. Many will want to pay more attention to questions such as storms, floods or droughts with a low probability but high impact, as have been seen around the world in recent weeks. \"This time around, governments have asked the IPCC to also look at low probability events that could be potentially very damaging,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. \"So we can expect a lot more information. In fact, for almost the first time in the IPCC, (we'll get) a lot more explicit information about the risks of extreme climate events.\" As well as new information on sea-level rise and the state of the Arctic and Antarctic, the summary report will likely have new information on the chances of holding the global rise in temperatures to 1.5C this century.  It will assess whether governments are on track to meet the targets agreed in the Paris climate pact.  This is the first time that the IPCC has attempted an approval session remotely. These gatherings are usually a week long and often involve quite vigorous discussions between government representatives and scientists.  With just a few months left before the COP26 climate conference, the stakes for the participants are perhaps higher than at any time in recent history.  Given the scale of weather-related disasters we are witnessing around the world, the public and politicians are now more attuned to the issue of climate change than ever before. All this will add to the pressure on the IPCC. There are likely many long nights ahead for the participants.  Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK is already undergoing disruptive climate change with increased rainfall, sunshine and temperatures, according to scientists. The year 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, scientists said in the latest  UK State of the Climate report. No other year is in the top 10 on all three criteria. The experts said that, in the space of 30 years, the UK has become 0.9C warmer and 6% wetter. The report's lead author Mike Kendon, climate information scientist at the UK Met Office, told BBC News: \u201cA lot of people think climate change is in the future \u2013 but this proves the climate is already changing here in the UK. \u201cAs it continues to warm we are going to see more and more extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods.\u201d  The report says the UK has become hotter, sunnier and rainier: Scientists warn of worse extreme weather if global temperatures rise and politicians fail to curb carbon emissions.   And in a separate report, scientists warned that greenhouse gas levels were already too high \u201cfor a manageable future for humanity\u201c. Liz Bentley, head of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that even if governments could achieve the challenging outcome of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C \u2013 which looks very unlikely - that would still lead to a 10% increase in the amount of water the air can hold. \u201cIn the UK,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are likely to see temperatures of 40C. As we get 1.5C warming, that\u2019ll be something we see on a regular basis.  \"People don\u2019t realise that even a small temperature rise of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees overall can make a huge difference \u2013 especially in the frequency and intensity of extreme events. \u201cWe had roads melting last year, rails start to buckle, electric cabling starts to buckle. We often say we\u2019d like a climate like the Med, but people were soon complaining they were too hot - not just in the day but especially at night. \u201cIt often takes a massive high-impact event to change attitudes to the climate \u2013 so let\u2019s hope what\u2019s been happening recently with extreme weather will raise the will to tackle the problem.\u201d The State of the Climate report also indicates that plants are responding to the changes in climate. Leaves appeared on average 10.4 days earlier than the 1999-2019 baseline for a range of common shrub and tree species. While the signs of spring got earlier, so did the indications of autumn - trees in 2020 went bare on average 4.3 days earlier than the baseline. The report also said that, while substantial snow fell in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, the number and severity of such weather events have declined since the 1960s. Sir James Bevan, the head of the Environment Agency, said there were more than five million homes at risk of flooding in England - and \"that risk is rising as the climate changes\". \"We can't remove the risk but we can reduce it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the EA's thinking needed to change faster than the climate, and its new strategy was not only about preventing floods, but also making communities more resilient to flooding when it does happen so that it does less damage. And Sir James said the government has made its biggest investment yet in flood defences,  with \u00a35.2bn of funding  to be spent on building 2,000 new flood defence schemes over the next six years. Meanwhile, a new paper from the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, founded by the former UK chief scientist Prof Sir David King, asks whether rapid heating in the Arctic region is driving changes in the jet stream in a way that influenced the recent weather extremes.  The jet stream is a core of strong winds travelling west to east about five to seven miles above the Earth. The new paper said: \"We are simultaneously witnessing weather disaster in Germany, the highest temperatures for June in Finland and the US, the catastrophic heatwave in British Columbia, and extreme heat in Siberia. \"These are all outlier events that exceed what one would expect if it were 'only' a 1.2C warming impact (that's the amount the Earth has already warmed since pre-industrial times). \"Greenhouse gas levels are already too high for a manageable future for humanity.\" The paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, urges governments to start removing greenhouse gases at scale from the atmosphere.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UN researchers are set to publish their strongest statement yet on the science of climate change.  The report will likely detail significant changes to the world's oceans, ice caps and land in the coming decades.  Due out on Monday, the report has been compiled by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC). It will be their first global assessment on the science of global heating since 2013.  It is expected the forthcoming Summary for Policymakers will be a key document for global leaders when they meet in November. The politicians are due to gather for a climate summit, known as  COP26 , in Glasgow. After  two weeks of virtual negotiations  between scientists and representatives of 195 governments, the IPCC will launch the first part of a three-pronged assessment of the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. It is the presence of these government officials that makes the IPCC different from other science bodies. After the report has been approved in agreement with governments, they effectively take ownership of it.  On Monday, a short, 40-page Summary for Policymakers will be released dealing with the physical science.  It may be brief, but the new report is expected to pack a punch. \"We've seen over a couple of months, and years actually, how climate change is unfolding; it's really staring us in the face,\" said Dr Heleen de Coninck, from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, who is a coordinating lead author for the IPCC Working Group III.   \"It's really showing what the impacts will be, and this is just the start. So I think what this report will add is a big update of the state of the science, what temperature increase are we looking at - and what are the physical impacts of that?\"  According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. \"Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings. \"Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events.\"  As well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis.  In the last report in 2013, the IPCC said that  humans were the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s . It's expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems.   One of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative. \"In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London. As the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change. The IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating. The first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday. Many have welcomed this development. \"I remain hopeful that the scientific evidence will show the stark reality of a world already altered by our rapidly changing climate and will motivate all nations to deliver urgent emission reductions and the necessary amount of climate finance at COP26,\" said Mohammed Adjei Sowah, who is the mayor of Accra in Ghana and vice chair of the  C40 group  of cities. \"We only need to look out of our windows to see that the climate crisis is already here. Cities such as Accra and nations such as Ghana, which have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions, will experience many of the greatest impacts.\" One of the things that gives the report additional muscle is the fact that it is not just one particular research paper on one topic - the reviewers consider all the research carried out on each area of focus.  \"Sometimes the IPCC gets criticised for being focused on consensus, and it's suggested that this can weaken statements,\" said Dr Emily Shuckburgh, from the University of Cambridge. \"But the fact that it is a summary across multiple lines of evidence is incredibly powerful and incredibly useful.\" One key question in the new summary will be about the 1.5C temperature target. The climate summit held in the French capital, Paris, in 2015, committed nations to try to limit the rise in global temperature from pre-industrial times to no more than 1.5 degrees.  And in 2018, the IPCC released a  special report on keeping to this target. What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? \"That report showed very clearly was that there are clear, clear benefits to limiting warming to 1.5C and those benefits have only become clearer over the past three years,\" said Dr de Coninck, who was one of the key authors of that study. \"If this report says something about that temperature limit in relation to emissions and how they are developing, it will have a political influence on COP26 I think.\" With just a few months to go until world leaders meet in Glasgow for the climate conference that is seen as the most important since the Paris agreement came into being in 2015, this new report will be required reading for all attendees. \"I think it's going to be a wake-up call, there's no doubt about that,\" said Richard Black, an honorary research fellow at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. \"But then again, so are some of the real world events that we're seeing around us at the moment.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a  greenhouse gas which causes climate change . This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.  Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.   However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India.  Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made.  Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,  pledged to cooperate more over the next decade  in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action.  Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -  promised to stop deforestation  by 2030. This is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2.  Similar initiatives  haven't stopped deforestation , but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. A  scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030  was agreed by more than 100 countries.  Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming.  The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tn  agreed to back \"clean\" technology , such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise.  Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding.  COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015  Paris Agreement .  Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030.  The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach  net zero  by mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Top image from Getty Images.

{"id":null,"body":"By Francesca Gillett BBC News The world is \"dangerously close\" to running out of time to stop a climate change catastrophe, the UK government's climate chief Alok Sharma has said. Mr Sharma - who is leading COP26, the climate summit hosted by the UK this year - said the effects were already clear with floods, fires and heatwaves. \"We can't afford to wait two years, five years, 10 years - this is the moment,\"  he told the Observer. But he did not condemn the government for allowing more fossil fuel projects. And he defended his decision to travel to  more than 30 countries in seven months. Mr Sharma's interview with the Observer comes ahead of  a major report being released on Monday  from the United Nations' climate change researchers. The report is set to be the strongest statement yet from the UN group on the science of climate change - and will likely give details about how the world's oceans, ice caps and land will change in the next decades. The summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments, which - having signed off on the findings - will be under pressure to take more action at COP26 in November. Doug Parr, chief scientist with Greenpeace UK, said \"world leaders have done a terrible job of listening\" to warnings about climate change. \"This year, this has to change. We don't need more pledges, commitments and targets - we need real action right here right now.\" Wildfires are currently raging in Greece, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes - and fires  have also been burning in Turkey  and California in the US. This summer,  western Europe also saw  its worst flooding in decades, which killed dozens of people. Mr Sharma said if urgent action was not taken, the consequences would be \"catastrophic\".  \"I don't think there's any other word for it,\" he said. \"You're seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.\" This video can not be played He added: \"We're seeing the impacts across the world - in the UK or the terrible flooding we've seen across Europe and China, or forest fires, the record temperatures that we've seen in North America. Every day you will see a new high being recorded in one way or another across the world.\" Mr Sharma said the report released on Monday is \"going to be the starkest warning yet that human behaviour is alarmingly accelerating global warming\". \"I don't think we're out of time but I think we're getting dangerously close to when we might be out of time. We will see [from the IPCC] a very, very clear warning that unless we act now, we will unfortunately be out of time.\" \"Africa has been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up and act on climate change for years,\" Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid's senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, highlighting the \"changing rainfall patterns or overbearing heat\" endured by the continent in recent years. He added: \"The important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable.\"  Glasgow is set to host the COP26 summit in November - which is the UN climate change conference.  The summit is seen as vital if climate change is to be brought under control, and leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action.  But campaigners have accused the UK of hypocrisy, as there are plans to tap a new oil field off Shetland. The government has also said more oil and gas wells can be drilled in the North Sea, and there are plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria. Earlier this year, the global energy watchdog the International Energy Agency said there cannot be any new investment in oil, gas or coal projects if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. Mr Sharma refused to criticise the government's plan for the projects, saying: \"Future [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation. \"There will be a climate check on any licences.\" This video can not be played Mr Sharma's interview comes after he was criticised for flying abroad for meetings - and visiting more than 30 countries in seven months. However, since then some environmental campaigners including Greenpeace have defended him, saying face-to-face meetings are important to persuade other nations to tackle climate change. Mr Sharma told the Observer that in-person meetings were \"incredibly vital and actually impactful\". \"It makes a vital difference, to build those personal relationships which are going to be incredibly important as we look to build consensus,\" he said. It also emerged in the Sunday Mirror that  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did not self-isolate after returning from France, which was on the amber plus list meaning all arrivals must quarantine.   A government spokesman said it was Mr Raab's job to represent the UK abroad and he followed Covid guidelines on return.

{"id":null,"body":"The world's largest ever report into climate change will be published later, setting out the stark reality of the state of the planet. The study is by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  - a UN group that looked at more than 14,000 scientific papers. It will be the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades. Scientists say it will likely be bad news - but with \"nuggets of optimism\". And environmental experts have said it will be a \"massive wake-up call\" to governments to cut emissions. The last time the IPCC looked at the science of global warming was in 2013 - and scientists believe they have learnt a lot since then. In recent years, the world has seen record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires and devastating flooding.  Some papers studied by the panel show that some of the changes humans are inadvertently making to the climate will not be reversed for hundreds or maybe thousands of years.  The IPCC's findings - which will be revealed at a press conference at 09:00 BST - will also be used during a major summit hosted by the UK in November. The summit, COP26, which is run by the UN, is seen as a critical moment if climate change is going to be brought under control. Leaders from 196 countries will meet to try and agree action.  Alok Sharma, the UK minister who is leading the summit,  said at the weekend that the  world was almost running out of time to avoid catastrophe - and the effects of climate change were already happening. The intergovernmental panel brings together representatives of world governments who appraise research by scientists. That means all governments buy into the findings.  The last panel was in 2013 and researchers say much has firmed up since then.  Previously, for instance, they were reluctant to ascribe extreme events such as heatwaves and torrential rain to being at least partly down to climate change.  Now in the case of the  heatdome in the US  in June, they're confident to say it would have been almost impossible without climate change.  They say the world will continue to get hotter.  It will also - especially in northern Europe - get wetter, though droughts will increase too as weather patterns shifts.  The panel studied papers showing that sea level would continue to rise for hundreds or possibly thousands of years because of heat already trapped in the ocean deep.  Research does confirm though, that if politicians can stick to holding global temperature increase down to 1.5C, on pre-industrial times, the worst catastrophes can still be avoided. Prof Piers Forster, an expert in climate change from the University of Leeds, said the report \"will be able to say a whole lot more about the extremes we are experiencing today and it will be able to be categoric that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing them and they are also going to get worse\". \"The report will come with quite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we're going, but there are going to be nuggets of optimism in there which I think are really good for the climate change negotiations,\" he told LBC. One of the causes for optimism he mentioned was that there is still a chance of keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees.  Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. So far,  global temperatures have climbed  to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 established the goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to no more than 2C and to try not to surpass 1.5C.  Richard Black, from non-profit advisory group the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"Coming just before COP26, this report is a massive wake-up call to all those governments that have not yet put forward realistic plans to cut emissions over the next decade. \"It will show that choices made now have a big effect on our future - leading to a runaway world of wild weather impacts and incalculable risks at one end, and at the other a future where climate change is constrained within manageable bounds.\" According to many observers, there have been significant improvements in the science in the last few years. \"Our models have gotten better, we have a better understanding of the physics and the chemistry and the biology, and so they're able to simulate and project future temperature changes and precipitation changes much better than they were,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, an observer at IPCC meetings. \"Another change has been that attribution sciences have increased vastly in the last few years. We can make greater links between climate change and extreme weather events.\"  As well as updates on temperature projections, there will likely be a strong focus on the question of humanity's role in creating the climate crisis.  In the last report in 2013, the IPCC said that  humans were the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s . The message in the latest report is expected to be even stronger, with warnings of how soon global temperatures could rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts say the impacts of climate change are far more severe when the increase is greater than 1.5C. This video can not be played It is expected that this time the IPCC will also outline just how much of an influence humans are having on the oceans, the atmosphere and other aspects of our planetary systems.   One of the most important questions concerns sea-level rise. This has long been a controversial issue for the IPCC, with their previous projections scorned by some scientists as far too conservative. \"In the past they have been so reluctant to give a plausible upper limit on sea-level rise, and we hope that they finally come around this time,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL in London. As the world has experienced a series of devastating fires and floods in recent months that have been linked to climate change, the report will also include a new chapter linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a UN body set up in 1988 to assess the science around climate change. The IPCC provides governments with scientific information they can use to develop policies on global heating. The first of its comprehensive Assessment Reports on climate change was released in 1992. The sixth in this series will be split into four volumes, the first of which - covering the physical science behind climate change - will be published on Monday. Further parts of the review will cover impacts and solutions. A summary has been approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments.

{"id":null,"body":"By Navin Singh Khadka Environment correspondent, BBC World Service Low-income countries are struggling to protect themselves against climate change, officials and experts have told the BBC.  Organisations representing 90 countries say that their plans to prevent damage have already been outpaced by climate-induced disasters, which are intensifying and happening more regularly.   The UN says the number of developing countries with climate adaptation plans has increased. But it stresses that there's limited evidence these plans have reduced any risks.  \"We need to adapt our plans to the worsening climate crisis. Our existing plans are not enough to protect our people,\" says Sonam Wangdi, chair of the UN's Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group on climate change.  Their call for action comes as the UN's climate science body prepares to publish its latest assessment on Monday about the state of global warming.  The report, compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, will provide a scientific assessment of current and future climate change, and be a key reference for policymakers at the UN climate summit in Glasgow this November.   The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Last year, the Caribbean had a record-breaking 30 tropical storms - including six major hurricanes. The World Meteorological Organisation says the region is still recovering.  On islands like Antigua and Barbuda, experts say that many buildings have been unable to withstand the intense winds these storms have brought.  \"We used to see category four hurricanes, so that's what we have prepared for with our adaptation plans, but now we are being hit by category five hurricanes,\" says Diann Black Layner, chief climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.  \"Category five hurricanes bring winds as strong as 180 miles per hour which the roofs cannot withstand because it creates stronger pressure inside our houses,\" she said.  Several Pacific Island countries were hit by three cyclones between the middle of 2020 and January 2021.  \"After those three cyclones, communities in the northern part of our country have seen the sea walls built as part of their adaptation plans crumbling,\" says Vani Catanasiga, head of the Fiji Council of Social Services - a group representing Fijian NGOs in the country's Disaster Management Council.  \"The water and the wind repeatedly battering the settlements even displaced some locals.\"   Although it's rare to see so many storms in such a short space of time, experts say sea storms have been growing in strength.  Studies suggest tropical cyclones have become more intense in the past 40 years, but an increase in the overall number of cyclones has not been established.    In Uganda, communities in the Rwenzori region have been trying to protect themselves from landslides and floods by digging trenches and planting trees, helping to prevent soil erosion.   But it has not always been a success.  \"The rains have become so intense that we have seen huge, sudden floods sweeping away these defences,\" said Jackson Muhindo, a local climate change and resilience coordinator for Oxfam.  \"As a result, there have been multiple landslides on mountain slopes which have buried settlements and farms,\" he adds. \"Adaptation works based on soil conservation are proving to be increasingly useless in the wake of these extreme weather events.\"    The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says more than 80% of developing countries have begun formulating and implementing their national adaptation plans.   But a study by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), published last month, suggests that the 46 of the world's least-developed countries don't have the financial means to \"climate proof\" themselves.   The IIED says these countries need at least $40bn (\u00a328.8bn; \u20ac33.8bn) a year for their adaptation plans. But between 2014-18, just $5.9 billion of adaptation finance was received.   Under the UN climate convention, the EU and 23 developed countries have pledged to make $100bn available every year to fund climate-related projects in developing nations - like schemes to cut emissions, and adaptations to mitigate damage caused by weather-induced disasters.  From 2020, this money will be passed on through the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility and other such agencies. But developing countries argue that promise has largely been unkept. A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed developed countries had made nearly $80bn available in 2018 as total climate finance. But it found that only 21% of that money was provided for adapting to climate impacts, while most went towards cutting carbon emissions. Developing countries have criticised climate finance figures provided by developed world, pointing out they also include money from regular aid payments.   Some experts say adaptation plans have been hampered by politics.  \"When you have other issues like [bad] governance, poverty and now Covid, it becomes very difficult for the plans to work. They simply aren't a government's priority,\" according to Carlos Aguilar, a climate adaptation expert with Oxfam.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said. The landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade.  The report \"is a code red for humanity\", says the UN chief. But scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast. There is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures.  Echoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success.\"  The sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments. Their report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26. In strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says \"it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\". According to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point. \"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.\" Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: \"By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before.\" The authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years. This warming is \"already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe\".  Whether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, \"their attribution to human influence has strengthened\" over the past decade. The new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.  The oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries. \"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming,\" said Prof Hawkins.   \"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back.\" When it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions. However, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150. Such outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100.  One key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity. Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015. This pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C. This new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place.  1.1\u00b0C The increase in temperature since pre-industrial times 2,400bn tonnes CO2 humans have emitted to date 500bn tonnes more would leave only a 50-50 chance of staying under 1.5\u00b0C 40bn tonnes Roughly amount of CO2 humanity emits every year The authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier. This was predicted in the  IPCC's special report on 1.5C  in 2018 and this new study now confirms it. \"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Ni\u00f1o in 2016,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia.  \"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never.\" The consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C. \"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors. \"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world.\" This video can not be played Prof Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: \"The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming.\" So what can be done? While this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures.  Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees. \"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero,\" said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK. \"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling.\" While the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism. \"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points,\" said Dr Otto. \"We are not doomed.\" A tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming. For political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight. Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The  UN report on the science of climate change  is set to make a huge impact. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers some of the key lessons from it.  For those who live in the West, the dangers of warming our planet are no longer something distant, impacting people in faraway places. \"Climate change is not a problem of the future, it's here and now and affecting every region in the world,\" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, and one of the many authors on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. It is the confidence of the assertions that the scientists are now making that is the real strength of this new publication. The phrase \"very likely\" appears 42 times in the 40-odd pages of the Summary for Policymakers. In scientific terms, that's 90-100% certain that something is real.  \"I think there's not one single kind of new surprise that comes out, it's the over-arching solidness that makes this the strongest IPCC report ever made,\" Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London (UCL), told BBC News. Prof Petersen is a former Dutch government representative at the IPCC, and was an observer at the approval session that produced this report. \"It's understated, it's cool, it's not accusing, it's just bang, bang, bang, one clear point after the other.\" The clearest of these points is about the responsibility of humanity for climate change.  There's no longer any equivocating - it's us. When the last IPCC report on the science of climate change was published in 2013, the idea of 1.5C being the safe global limit for warming was barely considered.   But in the political negotiations leading up to the Paris climate agreement in 2015, many developing countries and island states pushed for this lower temperature limit, arguing that it was a matter of survival for them. A special report on 1.5C in 2018 showed the advantages of staying under the limit were massive compared to a 2C world. Getting there would require carbon emissions to be cut in half, essentially, by 2030 and net zero emissions reached by 2050. Otherwise, the limit would be reached between 2030 and 2052.  This new report re-affirms this finding. Under all scenarios, the threshold is reached by 2040. If emissions aren't reined in, 1.5C could be gone in around a decade.  Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then absorbing any remaining ones by, for example, planting trees. While the situation is very serious, it is not a sudden drop into calamity. \"The 1.5C threshold is an important threshold politically, of course, but from a climatic point of view, it is not a cliff edge - that once we go over 1.5C, suddenly everything will become very catastrophic,\" explained Dr Amanda Maycock, from the University of Leeds, and one of the authors of the new report. \"The very lowest emissions scenario that we assess in this report shows that the warming level does stabilise around or below 1.5C later on in the century. If that were the pathway that we would follow, then the the impacts would be significantly avoided.\" In the past, the IPCC has been criticised for being way too conservative when it came to assessing the risk of sea-level rise. A lack of clear research saw previous reports exclude the potential impacts of the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.  Not this time.  The report shows that under current scenarios, the seas could rise above the likely range, going up to 2m by the end of this century and up to 5m by 2150. While these are unlikely figures, they can't be ruled out under a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.  That's bad enough - but even if we get a handle on emissions and keep temperatures around 1.5C by 2100, the waters will continue to rise long into the future.  \"The gorilla that looms large in the background is these very scary sea-level rise numbers in the long term,\" said Prof Malte Meinshausen from the University of Melbourne and an IPCC author.  \"In the paper it shows that even with 1.5C warming we're looking at the long-term of two to three metres. And under the highest scenarios, we could be looking at multi-metre sea-level rise by 2150. That is just scary, because it's maybe not at the end of our lifetime, but it is around the corner and it will be committing this planet to a big legacy.\" Even if the sea-level rise is relatively mild, it will have knock-on effects that we cannot avoid.  \"With gradual sea-level rise, those extreme sea-level events that have occurred in the past, just once per century, will occur more and more frequently in the future,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC working group that prepared the new report. \"Those that occurred only once per century in the past are expected to occur once or twice per decade by mid-century. The information we provide in this report is extremely important to take into account and prepare for these events.\"  The warnings are clearer and more dire - but there is an important thread of hope running through this report.  Scientists have long been worried that the climate could be more sensitive to carbon dioxide than they thought.  They use a phrase - equilibrium climate sensitivity - to capture the range of warming that could occur if CO2 levels were doubled.  In the last report, in 2013, this ranged from 1.5C to 4.5C, with no best estimate.  This time round, the range has narrowed and the authors opt for 3C as their most likely figure.  Why is this important?  \"We are now able to constrain that with a good degree of certainty and then we employ that to really make far more accurate predictions,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, and an author on the report.  \"So, that way, we know that net zero will really deliver.\" Another big surprise in the report is the role of methane, another warming gas.  According to the IPCC, around 0.3C of the 1.1C that the world has already warmed by comes from methane. Tackling those emissions, from the oil and gas industry, agriculture and rice cultivation, could be a big win in the short-term. \"The report quashes any remaining debate about the urgent need to slash methane pollution, especially from sectors such as oil and gas, where the available reductions are fastest and cheapest,\" said Fred Krupp, from the US Environmental Defense Fund. \"When it comes to our overheating planet, every fraction of a degree matters - and there is no faster, more achievable way to slow the rate of warming than by cutting human-caused methane emissions.\"  The timing of this report, coming just a couple of months before the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, means that it will likely be the bedrock of the negotiations. The IPCC has some form here: their previous assessment in 2013 and 2014 paved the way for the Paris climate agreement.  This new study is far stronger, clearer and more confident about what will happen if politicians don't act.  If they don't act quickly enough and COP26 ends in an unsatisfactory fudge, then the courts might become more involved.  In recent years, in Ireland and the Netherlands, environmental campaigners have successfully gone to court to force governments and companies to act on the science of climate change.  \"We're not going to let this report be shelved by further inaction. Instead, we'll be taking it with us to the courts,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, senior political adviser at Greenpeace Nordic. \"By strengthening the scientific evidence between human emissions and extreme weather, the IPCC has provided new, powerful means for everyone everywhere to hold the fossil fuel industry and governments directly responsible for the climate emergency.  \"One only needs to look at the recent court victory secured by NGOs against Shell to realise how powerful IPCC science can be.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Barra Best BBC News NI Weather Presenter Ireland is getting warmer and wetter due to climate change, according to a major report published on Thursday. The  Status of Ireland Climate 2020 report  also shows that sea levels around the coast are rising. That report comes after a UN warning  of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding .  According to figures, rainfall has increased by 6% in the 30-year period leading up to 2018, compared to the previous 30 years. The decade up to 2015 was the wettest on record. The report from the Republic of Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency, Met \u00c9ireann and Marine Institute shows that the air temperature has risen by almost 1C in the last 120 years, with 15 of the top 20 warmest years on record having occurred since 1990. It also said that sea levels around Ireland have risen by approximately 2-3mm per year since the early 1990s according to satellite observations. Greenhouse gases are also continuing to rise with big increases compared to pre-industrial levels. Carbon dioxide is up by 50%, methane is up 170%, and nitrous oxide has increased by 20%. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising the temperature and  causing global warming or climate change.  However, aerosols which \"affect climate dynamics in several ways\" showed a marked decrease  \"highlighting the success of regulation and technological advances\".  Atmospheric levels of sulphur were down by around 80% in the 35-year period to 2015 as measured at Valentia in County Kerry. Speaking on RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland, Dr Ned Dwyer said it will take a collective effort to ensure change but it will be possible. \"The issue isn't just that if we turn the tap off on carbon emissions in the morning it's all happy days,\" she said. \"We have to actually adapt to the changes that are kind of built into the system. \"So in Ireland all local authorities and sectors are preparing those plans - so it's looking at things like how do we ensure that our towns and cities do not get flooded, how do we ensure that our road and rail infrastructure is going to stay good and not either get melted because of heat waves or get flooded due to excess rainfall.\" Climate report is 'code red for humanity' NI's first ever climate bill moves to next stage UN climate report is a 'frightening wake-up call' Minister pushes on with his own NI climate bill Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"July was the world's hottest month ever recorded, a US federal scientific and regulatory agency has reported. The data shows that the combined land and ocean-surface temperature was 0.93C (1.68F) above the 20th Century average of 15.8C (60.4F).  It is the highest temperature since record-keeping began 142 years ago. The previous record, set in July 2016, was equalled in 2019 and 2020. Experts believe this is due to the long-term impact of climate change.  In a statement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that July's \"unenviable distinction\" was a cause for concern.  \"In this case, first place is the worst place to be,\" NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement.  \"This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.\"  The combined land and ocean-surface temperature was 0.01C higher than the 2016 record.  In the Northern Hemisphere, land-surface temperature reached an \"unprecedented\" 1.54C higher than average, surpassing a previous record set in 2012.  The data also showed that July was Asia's hottest month on record, as well as Europe's second hottest after July 2018.  The NOAA statement also included a map of significant climate \"anomalies\" in July, which noted that global tropical cyclone activity this year has been unusually high for the number of named storms.  Earlier this week, a report from the United Nations said that climate change is having an \"unprecedented\" impact on earth, with some changes likely to be \"irreversible for centuries to millennia.\"  UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that the findings were \"a code red for humanity.\"  \"If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses,\" he said.  The authors of the report say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News A worldwide ban on ozone-depleting chemicals in 1987 has averted a climate catastrophe today, scientists say.  The  Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , banning chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons, has now  simulated  our \"world avoided\".  Without the treaty, Earth and its flora would have been exposed to far more of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called it \"perhaps the single most successful international agreement\".  Continued and increased use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) would have contributed to global air temperatures rising by an additional 2.5\u00b0C by the end of this century, the international team of scientists found. Part of that would have been caused directly by CFCs, which are also potent greenhouse gases.  But the damage they cause the ozone layer would also have released additional planet-heating carbon dioxide - currently locked up in vegetation - into the atmosphere.  \"In past experiments, people have exposed plants - basically tortured plants - with high levels of UV,\" lead researcher Dr Paul Young, of the Lancaster Environment Centre, said. \"They get very stunted - so they don't grow as much and can't absorb as much carbon.\" The scientists estimated there would be:  \"What we see in our 'world-avoided experiment' is an additional 2.5C warming above any warming that we would get from greenhouse-gas increases,\" Dr Young said. But similar collective action to limit greenhouse-gas emissions was likely to be much more challenging.  \"The science was listened to and acted upon - we have not seen that to the same degree with climate change,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme .  The experiment could appear to suggest hope for an \"alternative future\" that had avoided the worst consequences of climate change.  \"But I would be cautious of using it as a positive example for the climate negotiations,\" Dr Young said.  \"It's not [directly] comparable - but it's nice to have something positive to hold on to and to see that the world can come together.\" Follow Victoria  on Twitter Ozone layer 'rescued' from CFC damage Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt Taylor BBC Weather Heatwaves, deadly floods and wildfires - this summer  people are having to confront the link between extreme weather and climate change. Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have been trapping heat in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial era. As a consequence, average temperatures have risen by 1.2C.  This additional energy is unevenly distributed and bursts out in extremes like the ones we've been seeing this summer. Without reductions in global emissions, this cycle will keep going. Here are four ways climate change is contributing to extreme weather. To understand the impact of small changes to average temperatures, you need to to think of them as a bell curve, with extreme cold and hot at either end, and the bulk of temperatures in the middle. A small shift in the centre means that more of the curve touches the the extremes - and so heatwaves become more frequent and extreme. In the UK, warm spells have more than doubled in length in the past 50 years, according to the Met Office. But the record heatwaves in Western Canada and the US were made longer and more intense by another weather phenomenon - a heat dome. Weeks ago, a Pacific storm, fuelled by warmer-than-normal sea temperatures, disrupted the jet stream. When a storm distorts the jet stream, which is made of currents of fast-flowing air, it is a bit like yanking a long skipping rope at one end and seeing the ripples transferring along it.  These waves cause everything to slow drastically and weather systems can become stuck over the same areas for days on end. In an area of high pressure, hot air is pushed down and trapped in place, causing temperatures to soar over an entire continent.  In Lytton, Western Canada, temperatures hit 49.6C, breaking the previous record by almost 5C. Such an intense heatwave would have been virtually impossible without climate change, according to the World Weather Attribution network.  One theory is higher temperatures in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow down, increasing the likelihood of heat domes. And exceptional heat has not been limited to North America this summer. In Russia, a heatwave sent temperatures soaring - matching a 120-year record. Northern Ireland broke its temperature record three times in the same week, while a new high was set in the Antarctic continent. As heatwaves become more intense and longer, droughts can worsen.  Less rain falls between heatwaves, so ground moisture and water supplies run dry more quickly. And this in turn means the ground heats up more quickly, warming the air above and leading to more intense heat. Demand for water from humans and farming puts even more stress on water supply, adding to water shortages.  And by mid-July, following the early summer heatwaves, more than a quarter of US land was experiencing \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought. Wildfires can be sparked by direct human involvement - but natural factors can play a huge part.  The cycle of extreme and long-lasting heat caused by climate change draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.  And these tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed.  The impact of the heatwave on fire development was seen in an explosive fashion in western Canada this summer.  Fires developed so rapidly and explosively they created their own weather system, as  pyrocumulonimbus clouds  formed.  And these colossal clouds produced lightning, igniting more fires.   This same story is being repeated in Siberia. The frequency of large wildfires has increased dramatically in recent decades.  Compared with the 1970s, fires larger than 10,000 acres (40 sq km) are now seven times more common in western America, according to Climate Central, an independent organisation of scientists and journalists. In the usual weather cycle, hot weather creates moisture and water vapour in the air, which turns into droplets to create rain.  The warmer it becomes, however, the more vapour there is in the atmosphere, resulting in more droplets - and heavier rainfall, sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area. Historic flooding in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands has shown the devastating impact extreme rainfall events can have.  And these rainfall events are connected to the impacts of climate change elsewhere, according to Peter Gleick, a water specialist from the US National Academy of Sciences. \"When areas of drought grow, like in Siberia and western US, that water falls elsewhere, in a smaller area, worsening flooding, like Germany and Belgium,\" he says. The weather across the globe will always be highly variable - but climate change is making that more extreme.  And the challenge now is not only limiting the further impact people have on the atmosphere but also adapting to and tackling the extremes we are already facing. Top image from Getty Images.

{"id":null,"body":"Nations vulnerable to climate change have warned they are on the \"edge of extinction\" if action is not taken. The warning by a group of developing countries comes after  a landmark UN report argued that global warming could make parts of the world uninhabitable . World leaders including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the report a \"wake-up call to the world\". But some of the strongest reaction to its findings has come from countries that are set to be the worst hit. \"We are paying with our lives for the carbon someone else emitted,\" said Mohamed Nasheed, a former Maldives president who represents almost 50 countries that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Maldives is the world's lowest-lying country and Mr Nasheed said the projections by UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would be \"devastating\" for the nation, putting it on the \"edge of extinction\". According to the latest IPCC report, heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts will become more common and extreme. The UN's chief has labelled it a \"code red for humanity\". The report says there is \"unequivocal\" evidence that humans are to blame for increasing temperatures. Within the next two decades, temperatures are likely to rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, it adds. This video can not be played That could lead to sea levels rising by half a metre, but a rise of 2m by the end of the century cannot be ruled out. That could have a devastating impact on low-lying coastal countries, said Diann Black-Layne, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda, and lead climate negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. \"That is our very future, right there,\" Ms Black-Layne said. The report comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26. Boris Johnson, who is hosting the conference,  said the report showed help was needed for countries bearing the brunt  of climate change. \"Today's report makes for sobering reading, and it is clear that the next decade is going to be pivotal to securing the future of our planet,\" he said. \"We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.\" Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, more than 190 governments agreed the world should limit global warming to 2C or ideally 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the new report says that under all scenarios, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place. US Climate Envoy John Kerry said that to reach the targets, countries urgently needed to change their economies. \"This is the critical decade for action, and COP26 in Glasgow must be a turning point in this crisis,\" Mr Kerry said. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who confirmed on Monday that she will attend the COP26 talks, said the report \"confirms what we already know... that we are in an emergency\". \"We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis,\" she said on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The heavy rainfall behind deadly flooding in Europe in July was made more likely by climate change, scientists say. The floods in Germany, Belgium and other areas killed at least 220 people as towns and villages were swamped. Researchers say global heating made rainfall events like this up to nine times more likely in Western Europe. Downpours in the region are 3-19% more intense because of human induced warming.  The  dramatic and deadly floods  that hit Germany, Belgium and elsewhere in mid-July were a shock to weather forecasters and local authorities.  Lives were swept away and houses, motorways and railway lines destroyed by the rapidly rushing waters.  The severe flooding was caused by heavy rainfall over a period of 1-2 days on already sodden ground, combined with local hydrological factors such as land cover and infrastructure. To analyse the impact of climate change in events like this, researchers from the  World Weather Attribution  group focused on the heavy rainfall that preceded the floods.  They did this in part because some of the hydrological monitoring systems, which would have given them more accurate information about the floods, were destroyed by the waters.  The rainfall data showed that in the areas around the Ahr and Erft rivers in Germany and in the Meuse region of Belgium, intense downpours brought 90mm of rain in a single day.  This video can not be played While the scientists found a trend of increasing rainfall in these small regions, making a deduction about the influence of climate change was challenging, as there was also a large amount of natural variability from year to year in the local rainfall patterns.  To really see the influence of rising temperatures, the researchers had to broaden their analysis and look at a larger section of Western Europe, including eastern France, western Germany, eastern Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and northern Switzerland.  The team found that in this broad region, climate change driven by humans increased the intensity of rain that fell in a one day event in Summer by between 3% and 19%. Rising temperatures also made downpours similar to those that triggered the floods more likely to happen by a factor of between 1.2 and 9. Most rapid attribution studies to date have been carried out on extreme heat events such as the recent  US and Canadian wildfires . Working on extreme rainfall events is more of a challenge. \"We combined the knowledge of specialists from several fields of study to understand the influence of climate change on the terrible flooding last month, and to make clear what we can and can not analyse in this event,\" said Dr Sjoukje Philip who's a climate researcher, with the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and part of the WWA team. \"It is difficult to analyse the climate change influence on heavy rainfall at very local levels, but we were able to show that, in Western Europe, greenhouse gas emissions have made events like these more likely.\"  The researchers say that in the current climate, for any given location in Western Europe, they would expect a rainfall event like the one in July to happen once in 400 years.  With continued greenhouse gas emissions and rising temperatures, the heavy rainfall that brought misery to parts of Europe will become more common. \"Our state of the art climate models indicate increases in slow moving extreme rainfall events in a future warmer world,\" said Professor Hayley Fowler from Newcastle University. \"This event starkly shows how societies are not resilient to current weather extremes. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible, as well as improving emergency warning and management systems and making our infrastructure 'climate resilient' - to reduce casualties and costs and make them more able to withstand these extreme flooding events.\" The study, which used peer reviewed methods, was carried out by 39 researchers.

{"id":null,"body":"By Andrew Harding Africa correspondent, BBC News Madagascar is on the brink of experiencing the world's first \"climate change famine\", according to the United Nations, which says tens of thousands of people are already suffering \"catastrophic\" levels of hunger and food insecurity after four years without rain. The drought - the worst in four decades - has devastated isolated farming communities in the south of the country, leaving families to scavenge for insects to survive. \"These are famine-like conditions and they're being driven by climate not conflict,\" said the UN World Food Programme's Shelley Thakral.  The UN estimates that 30,000 people are currently experiencing the highest internationally recognised level of food insecurity - level five - and there are concerns the number affected could rise sharply as Madagascar enters the traditional \"lean season\" before harvest. \"This is unprecedented. These people have done nothing to contribute to climate change. They don't burn fossil fuels\u2026 and yet they are bearing the brunt of climate change,\" said Ms Thakral. In the remote village of Fandiova, in Amboasary district, families recently showed a visiting WFP team the locusts that they were eating. \"I clean the insects as best I can but there's almost no water,\" said Tamaria, a mother of four, who goes by one name.  \"My children and I have been eating this every day now for eight months because we have nothing else to eat and no rain to allow us to harvest what we have sown,\" she added.  \"Today we have absolutely nothing to eat except cactus leaves,\" said Bole, a mother of three, sitting on the dry earth.  She said her husband had recently died of hunger, as had a neighbour, leaving her with two more children to feed.  \"What can I say? Our life is all about looking for cactus leaves, again and again, to survive.\" Although Madagascar experiences frequent droughts and is often affected by the change in weather patterns caused by El Ni\u00f1o, experts believe climate change can be directly linked to the current crisis. \"With the latest IPCC report we saw that Madagascar has observed an increase in aridity. And that is expected to increase if climate change continues.  \"In many ways this can be seen as a very powerful argument for people to change their ways,\" said Dr Rondro Barimalala, a Madagascan scientist working at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Viewing the same atmospheric data at Santa Barbara University in California, director of the Climate Hazards Center, Chris Funk, confirmed the link with \"warming in the atmosphere\", and said the Madagascan authorities needed to work to improve water management.  \"We think there's a lot that can be done in the short term. We can often forecast when there's going to be above normal rains and farmers can use that information to increase their crop production. We're not powerless in the face of climate change,\" he added. The current drought's impact is now being felt in larger towns in southern Madagascar too, with many children forced to beg on the streets for food.  \"The prices in the market are going up - three or four times. People are selling their land to get some money to buy food,\" added Tsina Endor, who works for a charity, Seed, in Tolanaro. Her colleague, Lomba Hasoavana, said he and many others had taken to sleeping in their cassava fields to try to protect their crops from people desperate for food, but this had become too dangerous.  \"You could risk your life. I find it really, really hard because every day I have to think about feeding myself and my family,\" he said, adding: \"Everything is so unpredictable about the weather now.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent How much of an impact on UK lifestyles will the government's goal of net zero carbon emissions really have? A new report says that while the 2050 target will require significant efforts from consumers, these should not result in \"massive lifestyle changes\". The study from the  Tony Blair Institute for Global Change  says that limitations on flying would need people to cut their travels by plane by 6% by 2035. For cars, the paper says that journeys should be cut by just 4%. Net zero is the phrase that is used to mean that any CO2 emissions that can't be curbed by clean technology by 2050 will either be buried using carbon capture and storage, or soaked up by plants and soils. This  new report  poses two key questions about that idea - what changes will people need to make in their lives to achieve it, and are they ready to make these changes? The study points out that most of the reductions in emissions to date have been achieved mainly by changing the nature of how we generate electricity. But reaching the UK's legally binding emissions targets for 2030, as well as hitting the net zero figure by 2050, will require \"significant behavioural changes from consumers (and voters) across the country\". A \"politically deliverable\" pathway to net zero, the Blair Institute report says, is one that \"focuses on a limited number of specific behaviour changes, minimises the need for massive lifestyle changes such as an end to flying or mass conversion to plant-based diets.\" This view is shared by many environmentalists. \"Most of the solutions needed to beat climate change can and should be designed to bring minimal disruption to our daily lives,\" said Caterina Brandmayr from  Green Alliance . \"Where some degree of change is required, politicians should be clear with the public about what's needed and make clear the wealth of benefits that would also follow, from cost savings to more comfortable homes and better health.\" So according to the study, the distance that people fly should be reduced by 6% per person, meaning most will still be able to fly when going on holiday in 30 years time.  \"I think you'll see changes to aviation by 2050, you'll see sustainable fuels and hydrogen, you'll see electric planes for shorter journeys,\" said Jess Ralston from the  Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit .  \"Look at what's happened in the last 30 years, we have the internet, we've changed the power system completely. The world is a very different place than 30 years ago, and it will be again in 2050. So I've got no doubt that we'll also still be flying on our holidays in 2050.\" While the majority may still be able to head for the airport in the decades to come, for a minority it's likely to be a lot more expensive.  In England in 2018, just 10% of people who flew frequently were responsible for more than half of all international flights.  Just under half the population didn't take a single flight that year.  If the government really wanted to make a dent in aviation emissions, many experts believe it would make more sense to tax these very frequent flyers. When it comes to driving the report points out that by 2035 people will need to be behind the wheel around 4% less than they are at present.  But the report also says that by then, around 60% of the car fleet is expected to be battery electric, as will all new vehicles sold.  This is a significant change and will require huge investment in infrastructure so that people can charge their shiny new EVs. That type of spending might keep costs high.  \"Alternative technologies will improve the quality of air that we breathe, which in turn, will improve the health of many - particularly as we move away from petrol and diesel forms of transport,\" said Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser and now head of the  Climate Crisis Advisory Group . \"We are already seeing an uptake of walking and cycling among consumers. However, a rapid transition to these alternative technologies requires progressive regulation to drive the transition, and in the short term at least, this will equate to rising costs for businesses.\"  On diet, the Blair Institute report restates the position of the Committee on Climate Change, which  earlier this year advised the government that people should eat 20% less meat and dairy by 2030 , rising to 35% less by 2050. A key aspect of achieving this change will be economic. \"One of the big issues is people can see that meat usually is a lot cheaper than it should be. And therefore, we have an issue of inequality,\" said Prof Mark Maslin from University College London. \"So trying to actually allow people on low incomes to have a more plant based diet is really important.\" Putting the right incentives in place to nudge people to more climate friendly diets is one thing. Getting them to change their boilers is quite another.  The Blair Institute study points out that by 2035 around 40% of homes would need to use low carbon heating systems.  This is one of the biggest challenges facing government when it comes to net zero.  Recent  media reports  indicate that the government is growing quite cool on the subject.  A full ban on existing gas boilers is now thought unlikely by 2035.  Experts say it is worth bearing in mind that some of the proposed replacement technologies such as heat exchangers have added benefits in a warming climate.  \"With the heat exchangers, of course they do heating and cooling,\" said Prof Maslin. \"So for at least at least a couple of weeks per year now and then probably a month or so in about 10 or 20 years time, you'll be wanting air conditioning in your house or your flat or apartment.\" Although the Blair Institute report emphasises that major lifestyle changes shouldn't be necessary, some scientists argue that this will only be the case as long as all the other policies to cut carbon are working.  So if replacing boilers doesn't go as fast as planned, it may well be that greater restrictions on emissions linked to consumer behaviour may be needed to make up the shortfall.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Last year was the warmest on record across Europe, breaking the previous high mark by a considerable distance, say scientists. Temperatures across the region were more than 1.9C above the long-term average between 1981 and 2010. The  State of the Climate 2020  report from the American Meteorological Society says temperatures in the Arctic are also rising rapidly.  The temperature over land there was the highest since records began in 1900. Reports  earlier this year  had confirmed that 2020 was Europe's warmest on record and one of the three hottest globally.  This new data shows that Europe's temperature margin over previous years was significantly greater than previously thought.  Not only was the year 1.9C above the long-term average, it was more than 0.5C greater than the previous high mark. \"This level of difference to the previous long-term average, which is a large difference, is something that is concerning,\" said Dr Robert Dunn, a senior climate scientist at the UK Met Office. \"It is something to sit up and take notice of, but it's not just the temperatures that are increasing, the extreme events, the heat waves we're seeing this year, and last year as well. We're seeing these responses across the world.\" Other researchers agreed that the scale of the record-breaking heat in Europe was troubling. \"The amount by which the previous record has been exceeded should worry us all,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. \"European temperatures are well measured and can be tracked back to the beginning of industrialisation and beyond, using documentary evidence and proxy records. This long-term context emphasises how unusual this warmth is.\"  The warmth across Europe brought huge temperature differences from the long-term average in some countries with Estonia, Finland and Latvia all recording anomalies of 2.4C. Overall, Europe has seen its five warmest years on record all occur since 2014. One other area of the world experiencing rapid warming is the Arctic.  Temperatures over land reached worrying new heights, getting to 2.1C above the 1981-2010 average. This was the highest since the series of records began 121 years ago. It was also the seventh year in succession with an annual average temperature more than 1C above the average.  \"The Arctic, we see warming incredibly rapidly. It was the warmest average surface temperature in the Arctic in a series going back 121 years, in 2020,\" said Dr Dunn. \"That, of course feeds down into places nearby, which includes Europe to some level. But we're seeing these effects throughout the world.\"  While rainfall around the world wasn't exceptionally high during 2020, the authors say that there's a clear response from the hydrological cycle to sustained heating. Total atmospheric water vapour was well above average. The extra moisture adds to the impact of higher temperatures on humans. Taken together, the indicators show what one of the study's editors calls \"our new normal\". \"This report follows closely on the latest [UN] IPCC [climate] report which could not be clearer in its messaging,\" said Dr Kate Willett, from the Met Office.  \"Our climate has changed and is likely to continue changing unless the key driver, greenhouse gases, are curbed, and what we're seeing now is already straining our society and our environment.\"  Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Government plans to decarbonise homes are too complicated and confusing, according to a coalition of consumer and industry groups.  They've written to the prime minister to say that current schemes to adapt homes go wrong far too often.  The open letter, from Citizens Advice and others, calls for more financial support for making changes. Otherwise, they argue, efforts to curb emissions from millions of homes in the UK will be at risk. Tackling energy use in the residential sector is seen as key to the government's aim of getting to net zero by 2050. Net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and then balancing out any further releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. The carbon generated by home heating amounts to about 20% of all UK emissions. But the government's current efforts to help householders to adapt their homes are \"too complicated\", and too often things go wrong, say industry and consumer groups. The coalition includes Citizens Advice, the Federation of Master Builders, the Aldersgate Group and Which? They argue that the process of installing low-carbon heating, upgrading insulation or putting in smart technologies is \"time consuming, confusing and stressful\". They cite the example of the Green Homes Grant, a scheme that was designed to help people insulate their homes.  It was scrapped in March this year after  reaching just 10% of the houses  that the government had promised would be improved.  According to the coalition, simply choosing the right technology or finding a reputable installer demands huge amounts of time, knowledge and effort.  Far too often, things go wrong with poor installation and technologies not working as expected.  The letter to the prime minister says there are three key concerns that need to be addressed to ensure that plans to decarbonise homes don't fail. \"Our evidence is clear. Right now, making green changes to homes is too confusing and too often things go wrong for those trying to do the right thing,\" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \"The public is behind the net zero transition, but they need the right information and tools, particularly when it comes to adapting their home. \"By getting things right now, the government can give people the confidence to make changes and play their part in getting to net zero.\" \"I think solar panels are a very good idea, especially for people who want to contribute to a cleaner environment.\"  That's the view of Michael, a homeowner in Liverpool who decided to ditch his gas heating for solar power a few years ago. All went well until his roof began to leak and damaged the ceiling in a bedroom. The first time it happened, the fitter repaired the problem.  When it happened again in the same spot, Michael found the company had gone out of business.  \"This trader had not been properly checked, I don't think they had a necessary qualification to be to be installing solar panels.\" Despite an insurance scheme that was meant to help out in circumstances like this, Michael has been unable to get his roof fixed. \"There is no effective guarantee, no effective accountability and responsibility which should have been in place to stop all this happening,\" he said. In response to the letter, a government spokesperson said: \"We are investing \u00a31.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes, with upgrades to 50,000 low-income households already underway. \"Our Simple Energy Advice service offers clear information on what financial support is available for people to make home improvements so they can save money on their energy bills.\"  In a separate study, the National Housing Federation said that England's homes produce more carbon emissions every year than all the country's cars.  The Federation, which represents housing associations across England, says that the emissions from homes are so high because of gas central heating and poor insulation. Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organization. However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply.  Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events.  But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths.  As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes.  In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a new  atlas  from the WMO that charts the scale of these events.  Over two million people died as a result of these hazards, with economic losses amounting to $3.64 trillion. \"The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas.  \"That means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapour in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\" he added. More than 90% of the deaths related to weather disasters have occurred in developing countries.  The biggest killers have been droughts, responsible for 650,000 deaths; while at the other end of the scale, extreme temperatures took nearly 56,000 lives.  But over the 50-year period, the overall death toll from disasters fell rapidly. \"Behind the stark statistics lies a message of hope,\" said Prof Taalas.  \"Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives.\" While more people have been saved in the face of an increasing number of extremes, the economic toll has mounted.  Reported losses in the decade between 2010-2019 were around $383m per day, a seven-fold increase on the $49m per day between 1970-1979.  Three of the extreme events with the biggest financial impact all occurred in the same year - 2017. It saw Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma hit the US. Taken together, the economic impact of the three accounted for 35% of the total losses from the top 10 disasters between 1970 and 2019.  The atlas points out that, while improvements in warning systems are helping to save lives, there is much more work to be done.  Only half of the 193 countries that are members of the WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems in place.  There are also huge gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and among island states in the Pacific and Caribbean.  \"More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events,\" said Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UN's Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. \"More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. \"We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management, ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies,\" she said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales environment correspondent This video can not be played A major summit on climate change is \"make or break\" for the planet's future, according to an environmental campaigner turned MP. In November, Glasgow will host COP26 - the largest gathering of world leaders in UK history. Anna McMorrin, Labour MP for Cardiff North, said it was an chance for Wales to \"reach out and show leadership\". Scientist Gareth Wyn Jones said he hoped recent extreme heatwaves, floods and wildfires would focus minds. The world's governments have been told they need to make drastic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades to hold back a dangerous rise in global temperatures. At a previous summit in Paris they agreed to try to stop the warming reaching 2C compared with pre-industrial times, and ideally no higher than 1.5C. But there was a big gap between that goal and the policies for action countries had been coming up with - putting the world on course for far worse climate change. COP26 is about trying to sort that out. Ms McMorrin said some of her constituents were already suffering the effects of climate change and she had seen \"first hand\" people moving furniture upstairs out of fear of flooding. \"It's a devastating way to live,\" she said. At the Paris summit in 2015 she was involved in negotiations about getting the role of smaller states and regions recognised in the text of the treaty that was signed there. Before becoming an MP she worked as a campaigner for Friends of the Earth and a special adviser to the Welsh government on cutting emissions. She said while Wales was \"punching above its weight\" in areas like recycling, planning policy and its Future Generations Act, it needed to be \"moving faster with charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, public transport and making it easier for people to use less energy in their homes\". \"We can't do it alone, we have to work within the UK and with partners overseas as well.\" Scientists recently reported Wales had seen an average  annual increase in temperatures of 0.9C since the 1970s  and would be a hotter, wetter place in future. It means severe flooding - like that experienced by several communities during storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge in 2020 - is likely to happen more often, even if we manage to get rid of greenhouse gases.   A damaging level of climate change is already - as they put it - \"baked in\". Steve Porretta's neighbourhood in north Cardiff was struck by flooding during storm Dennis in 2020.  He said: \"I could see the water was coming all the way down the road and coming over the bank. I'm thinking 'oh my God, we are actually really going to flood'. \"It's absolutely terrifying really, when you stand there and watch this water coming up and up and up, wondering whether it's going to be you.\" \ud83d\udd34 The areas of Wales that could be underwater by 2100...  More:  https:\/\/t.co\/bB8VRND61H   pic.twitter.com\/SUPrn0ygjT Though some of Mr Porretta's neighbours had to be rescued through their windows, his house was spared the worst of the flooding as it is slightly more elevated.  \"It's traumatic isn't it, we're living right next to the river. You're constantly then concerned, 'is it going to flood again?'\" In anticipation of another flood, Mr Porretta has put flood gates on all his doors. He said he is pessimistic about COP26. \"You'd hope that the governments of the world would see sense, come together and actually do the right thing. Unfortunately, historically, there's absolutely no precedent for that.\" Prof Jones, emeritus professor at Bangor University, warned the world had \"prevaricated\" for far too long and avoiding major climate change was now an \"extremely hard task\". Politicians, he said, needed to be straight with the public about the scale of the task. It means \"massive cuts\" to emissions in a matter of years, and \"getting urgency into the equation is very difficult because we've created a society which depends on consumerism,\" he said. Part of the answer lies in getting across to people how much carbon dioxide they themselves are responsible for emitting and encouraging them to reduce that, he suggested. In Wales, as across the UK, it is estimated approximately 10 tonnes of climate-warming gases are emitted per person each year, around double the global average. That needs to be cut to 0 by 2050. \"There are relatively simple things you can do - don't drive an SUV for starters, fly only if it's absolutely essential, don't waste food,\" said Mr Jones. Ella Smillie runs Benthyg Cymru, a \"library of things\", where people hire goods and can volunteer their time instead of paying. It was set up by the community and Ms Smillie hopes to establish 11 similar libraries across Wales in the run up to COP26.  More than 200 objects donated by locals are available to hire for as little as 50p a day, with power washers, carpet cleaners, lawnmowers and a gazebo some of the highest demands. Ms Smillie said: \"These are things you only need to use once or twice a year but take a huge amount of energy and resource to make.\" She said she hoped the summit could provide a \"huge opportunity\" for communities to talk to politicians about their own ideas and \"the immediate need to reduce our carbon footprint\". \"The climate emergency is the single biggest issue of our lifetimes,\" she said. \"One thing we can all do is reduce our consumption - and this is a really easy way for people to do that on an individual level while also supporting their communities to be more sustainable.\" Thunberg: Scotland not world leader on climate change Wales must prepare for 'hotter, wetter future' What is the Paris climate agreement?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new study shows that increases in extreme winter weather in parts of the US are linked to accelerated warming of the Arctic.  The scientists found that heating in the region ultimately disturbed the circular pattern of winds known as the polar vortex. This allowed colder winter weather to flow down to the US, notably in the Texas cold wave in February.  The authors say that warming will see more cold winters in some locations. Over the past four decades, satellite records have shown how increasing global temperatures have had a profound effect on the Arctic.  Warming in the region is far more pronounced than in the rest of the world, and has caused a rapid shrinkage of summer sea ice. Scientists have long been concerned about the implications of this amplification of global change for the rest of the planet.  This new study indicates that the warming in the Arctic is having a significant impact on winter weather in both North America and East Asia.  The researchers detail a complex meteorological chain that connects this warmer region to a rotating pattern of cold air known as the polar vortex. The authors show that the melting of ice in the Barents and Kara seas leads to increased snowfall over Siberia and a transfer of excess energy that impacts the swirling winds in the stratosphere above the North Pole.  The heat ultimately causes a stretching of the vortex which then enables extremely cold weather to flow down to the US. There has been an increase in these stretching events since satellite observations began in 1979. The scientists believe this vortex stretching process led to the  deadly Texas cold wave  in February this year.  \"We're arguing that melting sea ice across Northwest Eurasia, coupled with increased snowfall across Siberia is leading to a strengthening of the temperature difference from west to east across the Eurasian continent,\" explained lead author Dr Judah Cohen, who's a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a director of Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk management company.   \"We know when that temperature difference increases, that leads to more disruptions of the polar vortex. And when it's weakened, that leads to more extreme winter weather such as the Texas cold wave last February.\" The researchers say that their findings are based on both observations and modelling and they show a physical link between climate change in the Arctic, the stretching of the polar vortex and the impacts on ground. The authors believe their work could improve predictions about the onset of extreme cold winter events.  \"One of the benefits of this study is that if you recognise these precursors and you know the conditions that are favourable for triggering such event, then you get to extend your forecast lead time,\" said Dr Cohen. \"In Texas, people could have certainly prepared better with better warnings, some people froze to death in their homes and perhaps they could have gone to seek shelter.\" Looking at the bigger picture, the research team believes that their findings will help people understand that global warming is complex and perhaps dispel the idea that colder winters mean climate change isn't happening.   \"There has been a long-standing apparent contradiction between the warmer temperatures globally, however, an apparent increase in cold extremes for the United States and in northern Eurasia. And this study helps to resolve this contradiction,\" said fellow author, Prof Chaim Garfinkel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \"In the past, these cold extremes over the US and Russia have been used to justify not reducing carbon, but there's no longer any excuse to not start reducing emissions right away.\" The  study has been published  in the journal Science.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The countries most vulnerable to climate change are calling for an \"emergency pact\" to tackle rising temperatures.  The group wants all countries to agree radical steps to avoid \"climate catastrophe\" at the upcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow.  Green campaigners  are urging a postponement of the gathering, citing problems with vaccines for delegates.  The  Climate Vulnerable Forum  (CVF) says the event is critical and cannot wait. Representing some 1.2 billion people, the CVF consists of countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific.  The group has been key in pushing the rest of the world to accept the idea of keeping the rise in global temperatures to under 1.5C this century.  This was incorporated into the Paris agreement in 2015.  Recent research from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  suggests that the threshold will be passed in little over a decade at current rates of carbon emissions. In less than two months, global leaders will gather in Glasgow for  COP26 , the most critical meeting on climate change since Paris. Ahead of the Glasgow meeting, the CVF has issued a manifesto for what the conference must deliver to keep the planet safe and protect the most vulnerable.  Environmental groups have suggested postponing the meeting, on the grounds that vaccine distribution is inequitable and that delegates from poorer countries face huge bills for quarantine hotels when they arrive in the UK. However, the CVF member states insist the meeting must go ahead in person, and are calling for support and \"facilitated access\" to ensure inclusive participation.  The UK government has responded to these calls by agreeing to pay the quarantine hotel expenses of any delegate, observer or media from a developing country. The vulnerable group says that progress on climate change has stalled and COP26 should move forward with what it terms a \"climate emergency pact\". This would see every country put forward a new climate plan every year between now and 2025. At present, signatories of the Paris agreement are only obliged to put forward new plans every five years.  The vulnerable nations say that richer countries must fulfil their obligations to deliver $100bn in climate finance per year over the 2020-24 period.  The CVF nations want this money to be split 50-50 between cutting carbon and helping countries adapt to the threat posed by rising temperatures.  The countries also want the UK to \"take full responsibility\" for this aspect of the negotiations, saying it is vital to restore confidence in the Paris pact.  Among the other areas that the most vulnerable nations want to see progress on is the question of debt-for-climate swaps.  Many of the world's poorest countries have large debt burdens, and these have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic which has stretched finances even further.  In a debt-for-climate swap, a country can reduce what it owes to international creditors by directing the debt service payments to fund renewable energy or greater protection for nature.  One such restructuring was recently  announced by Belize  where the debt money will now go to support marine conservation projects instead. \"Vulnerable countries have unique needs - and public-private collaboration will be key to addressing them,\" said Nigel Topping, who's the UK's high-level climate action champion for COP26. \"Whether it is in debt for nature swaps such as the recent Belize announcement or in increasing public sector capability to structure investment projects to attract private finance, the aim is to accelerate progress in this area so that 2022 becomes the year of climate action solidarity.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent Dragonflies are moving northwards across Britain and Ireland as temperatures rise.  More than 40% of species have increased their distribution since 1970, while only about 10% have declined, according to a new report.  Experts from the British Dragonfly Society say it's an indicator of the effects of climate change. There is concern over the loss of populations of insects due to factors such as pollution and habitat loss. Conservation officer Eleanor Colver said while their data can determine where dragonflies are, it cannot determine exactly how many there are - and whether numbers have increased overall.  \"Factors such as the use of pesticides (reducing their flying insect prey), water pollution and habitat loss continue to threaten the health of dragonfly populations within species' existing ranges,\" she said. The report, State of Dragonflies 2021, incorporates 1.4 million records from 17,000 recorders gathered from 1970 onwards. It assesses the fortunes of 46 species of dragonflies and their close relative - the damselflies - across Britain and Ireland. Since 1995, several species have reached Britain from southern Europe for the first time - and at least two more have reappeared after long absences. Species expanding their range include the emperor dragonfly, migrant hawker, ruddy darter, black-tailed skimmer and small red-eyed damselfly. In contrast, some upland and northern dragonflies are in retreat, including the common hawker and black darter, perhaps because of the loss of peatbogs or extreme droughts. \"The increase in many species, if not all, we can put down to a combination of climate warming and more or better wetland habitats such as an increase in the number of ponds, lakes, gravel-pits and reservoirs in recent decades,\" said Dave Smallshire, co-editor of the report. But people should not get the message that all is \"tickety-boo with dragonflies\", he added.  \"The overwhelming message is that global climate change - and in the case of Britain and Ireland - significant climate warming is likely to have had an over-riding effect on many of these changes,\" he said. Dragonflies are fast-flying, four-winged insects with long bodies and large eyes. They were some of the first winged insects to evolve, some 300 million years ago. Scientists are increasingly concerned about the decline of some populations of insects. One scientific review of insect numbers in 2019 pointed to 40% of species undergoing \"dramatic rates of decline\" around the world. The study said bees, ants and beetles were disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles, while other species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, were likely to boom.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Almost 60% of oil and gas reserves and 90% of coal must remain in the ground to keep global warming below 1.5C, scientists say. The forecast is based on close analysis of global energy supply and demand.  It is a \"bleak\" but realistic assessment of \"what the science tells us is needed\", the researchers say. And they have \"painted a scenario of the future\" that leaves much less room for fossil fuels to be extracted than previously estimated.  Scientists say that limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C should help the world avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. Globally, the researchers calculated, production of fossil fuels needed to have peaked in 2020 and be on a steady decline of 3% every year until 2050.  \"Through the Covid pandemic, we have seen a large decline in production - but that is bouncing back,\" UCL associate professor of energy systems Dr Steve Pye told BBC News.   The research focuses on how much energy is required and what the limit must be on carbon emissions.  Dr James Price, also at UCL, said: \"We say to our model, 'Meet all those demands from now until 2100 without emitting too much carbon dioxide.' \"The result we get is a rapid reduction in fossil fuels - and a large amount of fossils fuels [left in the ground] - simply because the carbon budget is so tight.\"  The study,  in the journal Nature , also found the decline in oil and gas production required globally by 2050 - to stick to that tight carbon budget - means many regions face peak production now or during the next decade.  A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO2 that can be released in a period of time while keeping within a temperature threshold - in this case 1.5C. Many fossil-fuel extraction projects already planned or in operation are likely to hurt the world's chances of meeting internationally agreed target limits on global warming set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement. And this \"bleak picture\", the scientists say, \"is very probably an underestimate of what is required\".  The carbon budget determined by the modelling  would give the world a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5C.  But the study says: \"That does not consider uncertainties around, for example, climate-system feedbacks \"So to ensure more certainty of stabilising at this temperature, [even] more carbon needs to stay in the ground.\" The researchers highlight bold national policies to entirely phase out fossil-fuel extraction, including an alliance devised by Costa Rica and Denmark, set to be launched at the crucial United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow, this year, asking states to stop issuing fossil-fuel exploration permits.  And the scientists say they hope the \"stark numbers\" will inspire the political will to make swift and urgent change to move away from a reliance on fossil fuels.   Dr Price told the BBC: \"The physics doesn't care about the political will.  \"We know technically how to do this, it is just about actually doing it.\"   Follow Victoria  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"When you hear the word \"shapeshifting\" you probably think of a sci-fi or horror film, and not the climate. But that's what scientists say is happening to some animals in response to climate change. Warm-blooded species are evolving to have larger beaks, legs and ears to regulate body temperature as the planet warms up, a  new study  suggests. The scientists behind the study warn the physiological changes do not mean animals are coping with climate change. \"A lot of the time when climate change is discussed, people are asking 'can humans overcome this?' or 'what technology can solve this?'\" says the study's author, Sara Ryding, from Deakin University.  \"It's high-time we recognised that animals also have to adapt to these changes.\" If animals fail to control their body temperature, they can overheat and die.  Some animals in warmer climates have historically evolved to have larger beaks or ears to get rid of heat more easily. A larger wing, ear or beak relative to body size gives smaller animals a greater surface area from which to lose excess heat. Several species of Australian parrot have shown a 4-10% increase in bill size since 1871, which correlates with the rising summer temperatures over the years, the study says. The scientists do say it's hard to put the climate as the only cause of shapeshifting, but that other examples of species changing show the effect of heat. Wood mice are evolving to have longer tails, masked shrews are getting longer tails and legs, and bats in warm climates have bigger wings. Though the adaptations species are making are currently small, Sara says they could be more pronounced as the planet becomes hotter. \"Prominent appendages such as ears are predicted to increase, so we might end up with a live-action Dumbo in the not-so-distant future.\" The study suggests that shapeshifting is likely to continue as the climate becomes warmer because higher temperatures will influence the demand on animals to regulate their body temperature. This year has seen some countries record their highest temperatures in decades - with July recorded as the world's hottest month ever. \"Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is fine,\" Sara says. \"It just means they are evolving to survive it, but we're not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are, or that all species are capable of changing and surviving. \"The climate change that we have created is heaping a whole lot of pressure on them, and while some species will adapt, others will not.\" Follow Newsbeat on  Instagram ,  Facebook ,  Twitter  and  YouTube .

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst A new global survey illustrates the depth of anxiety many young people are feeling about climate change. Nearly 60% of young people approached said they felt very worried or extremely worried.   More than 45% of those questioned said feelings about the climate affected their daily lives. Three-quarters of them said they thought the future was frightening. Over half (56%) say they think humanity is doomed. Two-thirds reported feeling sad, afraid and anxious. Many felt fear, anger, despair, grief and shame - as well as hope.  One 16-year-old said: \"It's different for young people - for us, the destruction of the planet is personal.\" The survey across 10 countries was led by Bath University in collaboration with five universities. It's funded by the campaign and research group Avaaz. It claims to be the biggest of its kind, with responses from 10,000 people aged between 16 and 25.  Many of those questioned perceive that they have no future, that humanity is doomed, and that governments are failing to respond adequately.  Many feel betrayed, ignored and abandoned by politicians and adults. The authors say the young are confused by governments' failure to act. They say environmental fears are \"profoundly affecting huge numbers of young people\". Chronic stress over climate change, they maintain, is increasing the risk of mental and physical problems. And if severe weather events worsen, mental health impacts will follow. The report says young people are especially affected by climate fears because they are developing psychologically, socially and physically. This video can not be played The lead author, Caroline Hickman from Bath University, told BBC News: \"This shows eco-anxiety is not just for environmental destruction alone, but inextricably linked to government inaction on climate change. The young feel abandoned and betrayed by governments. \"We're not just measuring how they feel, but what they think. Four out of 10 are hesitant to have children. \"Governments need to listen to the science and not pathologise young people who feel anxious.\"  The authors of the report, to be published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health, say levels of anxiety appear to be greatest in nations where government climate policies are considered weakest.  There was most concern in the global south. The most worried rich nation was Portugal, which has seen repeated wildfires. Tom Burke from the think tank e3g told BBC News: \"It's rational for young people to be anxious. They're not just reading about climate change in the media - they're watching it unfold in front of their own eyes.\" The authors believe the failure of governments on climate change may be defined as cruelty under human rights legislation. Six young people are already taking the Portuguese government to court to argue this case. The survey was carried out by the data analytics firm Kantar in the UK, Finland, France, the US, Australia, Portugal, Brazil, India, the Philippines and Nigeria. It's under peer review on open access. Young people were asked their views on the following statements:  The researchers said they were moved by the scale of distress. One young person said: \"I don't want to die, but I don't want to live in a world that doesn't care for children and animals.\" Follow Roger on Twitter  @rharrabin Vulnerable countries seek emergency climate pact Weather-related disasters increase five-fold Why North America's killer heat scares me Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Becky Dale & Nassos Stylianou Data journalists The number of extremely hot days every year when the temperature reaches 50C has doubled since the 1980s, a global BBC analysis has found. They also now happen in more areas of the world than before, presenting unprecedented challenges to human health and to how we live.  The total number of days above 50C (122F) has increased in each decade since 1980. On average, between 1980 and 2009, temperatures passed 50C about 14 days a year.  The number rose to 26 days a year between 2010 and 2019. In the same period, temperatures of 45C and above occurred on average an extra two weeks a year. \"The increase can be 100% attributed to the burning of fossil fuels,\" says Dr Friederike Otto, associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. A location refers to an individual area of the globe about 25 sq km. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. The grids in this dataset are 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude. Locations displayed on the map above are those where the maximum temperature in a grid area went above 50C on a given day that year. The size of the circle plotted on the map relates to the number of days per year that crossed 50C at that specific location. The circles range in size from 1 to 25 days. When all years are represented, the circles show the total number of days over 50C at each point. The scale remains capped at 25 days for legibility.  This analysis uses maximum daily temperatures from the  global ERA5 dataset , produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. Although each grid can contain different topographies, the data treats each grid area uniformly. ERA5 combines weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from weather forecasting models. This process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world. As the whole world warms, extreme temperatures become more likely. High heat can be deadly for humans and nature, and cause major problems to buildings, roads and power systems. Temperatures of 50C happen predominantly in the Middle East and Gulf regions.  And after record-breaking temperatures of  48.8C in Italy  and  49.6C in Canada  this summer,  scientists have warned  that days over 50C will happen elsewhere unless we cut fossil fuel emissions.  \"We need to act quickly. The faster we cut our emissions, the better off we'll all be,\" says Dr Sihan Li, a climate researcher at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. \"With continued emissions and lack of action, not only will these extreme heat events become more severe and more frequent, but emergency response and recovery will become more challenging,\" warns Dr Li. The BBC analysis also found that in the most recent decade, maximum temperatures increased by 0.5C compared with the long-term average from 1980 to 2009. But these increases have not been felt equally around the world: Eastern Europe, southern Africa and Brazil saw some maximum temperatures rise by more than 1C, and parts of the Arctic and Middle East recorded increases of more than 2C. Scientists are calling for urgent action from world leaders at a  UN summit in Glasgow in November , where governments will be asked to commit to new emissions cuts in order to limit global temperature rises. This BBC analysis launches a documentary series called Life at 50C investigating how extreme heat is affecting lives across the world. Even below 50C, high temperatures and humidity can create severe health risks.  As many as 1.2 billion people around the world could face heat stress conditions by 2100 if current levels of global warming continue, according to a  study from Rutgers University in the US  published last year. That is at least four times more than those affected today. People are also facing difficult choices as the landscape around them changes, as extreme heat makes drought and wildfires more likely. While, other factors can contribute, climate change is also an important driving force behind desertification. Sheikh Kazem Al Kaabi is a wheat farmer from a village in central Iraq. The land around him was once fertile enough to sustain him and his neighbours, but it has gradually become dry and barren.  \"All this land was green, but all of that is gone. Now it is a desert, drought.\" Almost all the people from his village have moved away to look for work in other provinces. \"I lost my brother, dear friends and loyal neighbours. They shared everything with me, even my laughter. Now nobody shares anything with me, I'm just face-to-face with this empty land.\" This video can not be played It went over 50C in my area, why is it not featured? Reports of record temperatures usually come from measurements taken at an individual weather station, but the data we have studied represents larger areas than those covered by a single station.  For example, Death Valley National Park in southern California is one of the hottest places on Earth. Temperatures in certain parts of the park regularly pass 50C in summer. But when creating an average for maximum temperatures for the wider area, using several different sources, a figure below 50C is reached.  Where is the data from? The BBC has used the maximum daily temperatures from the high resolution global ERA5 dataset, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The data is often used to study global climate trends.  ERA5 combines actual weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from modern weather forecasting models.  The process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world and helps us to understand climate change.  What analysis have we done? Using the maximum temperature for every day from 1980 to 2020, we identified how often temperatures exceeded 50C.  We counted the number of days and locations with a maximum temperature of 50C or higher for every year, to determine the trend over time. We also looked at the change in maximum temperatures. We did this by working out the difference between the average maximum temperature over land and sea for the most recent decade (2010-2019) compared with the 30 years before (1980-2009).  Averages of at least 30 consecutive years are known as climatologies. These are used for showing how recent periods compare to a climate average.  What do we mean by 'location'? Each location is represented by a grid square of roughly 25 km by 25 km, and about  27-28 km wide at the equator. These grid squares can cover large areas and may contain many different types of landscape. The grids are squares of 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor Despite all the promises to take action, the world is still on course to heat up to dangerous levels. That's the latest blunt assessment of the United Nations.  Its experts have studied the climate plans of more than 100 countries and concluded that we're heading in the wrong direction.  Scientists recently confirmed that to avoid the worst impacts of hotter conditions, global carbon emissions needed to be cut by 45% by 2030.  But this new analysis shows that those emissions are set to rise by 16% during this period. That could eventually lead to a temperature rise of 2.7C (4.9F) above pre-industrial times - far above the limits set by the international community. \"The 16% increase is a huge cause for concern,\" according to Patricia Espinosa, the UN's chief climate negotiator.   \"It is in sharp contrast with the calls by science for rapid, sustained and large-scale emission reductions to prevent the most severe climate consequences and suffering, especially of the most vulnerable, throughout the world.\" It's a stark warning about the scale of the challenge faced at the COP26 climate conference, scheduled to take place in Glasgow in just over six weeks' time. The central aim of the giant event is to keep alive hopes of limiting the rise in global temperatures by persuading nations to cut their emissions.  Under the rules of the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries are meant to update their carbon reduction plans every five years. But the UN says that of 191 countries taking part in the agreement, only 113 have so far come up with improved pledges.  Alok Sharma, the British minister who will chair the COP26 conference, said nations that had ambitious climate plans were \"already bending the curve of emissions downwards\".  \"But without action from all countries, especially the biggest economies, these efforts risk being in vain.\"  A study by Climate Action Tracker found that of the G20 group of leading industrial nations, only a handful including the UK and the US have strengthened their targets to cut emissions.   In another analysis, the World Resources Institute and Climate Analytics highlight how China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - together responsible for 33% of greenhouse gases - have yet to submit updated plans.   It says that Australia and Indonesia have the same carbon reduction targets they did back in 2015 - while the Paris Agreement is meant to involve a \"ratchet mechanism\" of progressively deeper cuts.  And the study finds that Brazil, Mexico and Russia all expect their emissions to grow rather than to shrink.  For the poorest countries - most vulnerable to rising sea levels and new extremes of heat and drought - seeing a rapid fall in the gases heating the planet is a priority.  Sonam P Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries group, said: \"G20 countries must take the lead in quickly cutting emissions to mitigate climate change.  \"These are the countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility, and it's well past time they step up and treat this crisis like a crisis.\" There are hopes that China may revise its climate plans ahead of the Glasgow conference. As the world's largest emitter, it has previously said it aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. An announcement soon of more ambitious targets would give the talks a significant boost but there are no clues about when - or even whether - that might happen. Follow David  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"US President Joe Biden has urged world leaders to commit to cutting methane gas emissions by at least 30% below 2020 levels by the end of the decade. He said it would \"rapidly reduce the rate of global warming\" if other countries joined the US and the EU in signing up to the pledge.   Methane is a greenhouse gas that experts say is a harmful contributor to global climate change.  Mr Biden has made tackling the climate crisis one of his main priorities. The president reversed his predecessor Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from  the Paris agreement  - a legally binding international climate treaty adopted by nearly 200 countries - on his first day in office. Addressing world leaders at a virtual meeting on Friday, Mr Biden said cutting global methane emissions would not just help tackle climate change in the short term, but also improve public health and agricultural and fuel output. \"We believe the collective goal is ambitious but realistic, and we urge you to join us in announcing this pledge at [the UN climate conference] COP26,\" he said. According to the White House, the virtual meeting was attended by leaders from the UK, EU, Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, South Korea and Mexico, among others. In April, Mr Biden pledged to cut US carbon emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. Major sources of methane include agriculture, and leaks from oil and gas production and landfills. Methane is also produced when living things decompose and is also a natural gas. It persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2. Methane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can be harmful to the human body.

{"id":null,"body":"By Dulcie Lee & Marie Jackson BBC News This video can not be played A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the \"turning point for humanity\", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations. He warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming. Four areas needed tackling - \"coal, cars, cash and trees\", he said. Countries must take responsibility for \"the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves\". \"It's time for humanity to grow up,\" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. \"Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right.\" Setting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make \"substantial changes\" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises. \"I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,\" he said. Mr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for his  recent pledge  to stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad. But he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done. The UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be \"gone altogether\" by 2024. But Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of \"facing both ways\" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments. \"It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,\" he said. In his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: \"The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets.\" \"We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,\" he added. Elsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including: Amid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green. The prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement. However, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels. \"If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,\" Mr Johnson said. \"And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now. \"And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted.\" Boris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change. He has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030.  The international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough. And by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow. Yet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling. He previously pledged \"never to be lagging on lagging\". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution. Recent research showed his government had imposed  less than a quarter of the policies needed  to clean up the economy.    And some policies - like  not opposing a coal mine in Cumbria, cutting taxes on flying  and  building HS2  - will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down. At COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather. A recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years. What was agreed at COP26?

{"id":null,"body":"With just five weeks left until world leaders gather in Glasgow for a critical climate summit, the BBC's Matt McGrath and Roger Harrabin consider progress made at this week's UN gathering and the outstanding issues that remain. Climate change was the dominant theme at this year's UN General Assembly (UNGA) as countries recognised the seriousness of the global situation.  All across the planet, the hallmarks of rising temperatures are being keenly felt with  intense wildfires , storms and  floods  taking place on scales rarely seen. Against this backdrop, Boris Johnson  told the UN  it was \"time to grow up\" on the climate issue.  The prime minister fought to bring  November's UN climate summit  to Britain, and it's clear he sees himself and the UK as global leaders in tackling this planetary threat. His bizarre if powerful speech at the UN harnessed the Greek tragedian Sophocles and TV's Kermit the Frog to accuse some other leaders of behaving like adolescents waiting for someone else to tidy up their mess. Did it encourage or annoy them? That's not yet clear. But how's Mr Johnson faring with his own policies? Well, even the most grudging environmentalist would give him high marks for target-setting. The UK pledges to cut 78% of its emissions by 2035 - that's from a 1990 baseline.   That doesn't include emissions created abroad in the process of manufacturing the goods bought in the UK - but leave that to one side for the moment, because Britain is not on course for that 78% target anyway. A  report showed its current plans  are projected to deliver less than a quarter of the cuts needed to meet the goal. The government didn't deny that. It warned little progress has been made recently in areas such as agriculture, power, and waste (a major source of emissions). The government has promised to put effective policies in place before the November conference, known as COP26, is held in Glasgow. But it's had policy rows over gas boilers, farm subsidies, aviation - and especially over how the zero-carbon revolution will be funded. What's more, several of Mr Johnson's current policies will send emissions up, not down. He's not opposing a coal mine in Cumbria or oil drilling off Shetland; he's cutting taxes on flying; and he's building new roads and the HS2 railway despite the  massive amount of CO2 created to make the infrastructure .  Environmentalists warn these will prove embarrassing during the Glasgow summit.  Both the US and China used the UN platform to take important steps forward.  President Biden underlined his commitment to a multilateral approach to climate change by announcing a significant increase in the US financial contribution to climate aid.  The US will in future pay $11.4bn per annum in climate finance, doubling the amount they  previously committed to at a leader's summit in April . \"It's welcome but not sufficient,\" said Jennifer Tollman, who's with E3G, a climate change think tank.  \"This still needs to get through Congress. And even if that happens, the doubling wouldn't actually be happening until 2024.\" The other big climate story was China's statement that it would not build any more coal plants overseas. It's the second year in a row that China's President Xi Jinping has used the forum to announce significant climate policy.  While critics have pointed out that China was already in the process of slowing down these projects, there has been a general welcome for the step. \"China's overseas moratorium is a big deal,\" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace. \"Beijing has been the last man standing in supporting coal projects across the developing world. Its ban on these projects will significantly shape the global energy landscape in the years to come.\"  There are still no details on what the new commitment will mean, or when it comes into force and what exactly it . But  analysis suggests  that it would result in the cancellation of 11 coal projects across eight countries in Africa alone.  While applauding the move, many experts said they wanted more clarity from China on reducing its domestic reliance on coal. China's dependence on coal is such that the  country has increased its share of global coal-fired power generation to 53% in 2020 . \"The main event is for China to pledge a major cut in its emissions now, in this decade, as US, EU and others have,\" tweeted former US climate envoy Todd Stern. \"China counts for 27% of global CO2 emissions. No chance to keep 1.5C alive unless China steps up for real,\" he wrote, referring to the key temperature threshold that scientists believe is the threshold of highly dangerous warming.  Whisper it cautiously, but there were a few announcements at UNGA that suggest progress is being made.  According to analysis carried out by E3G, some of the highlights included:  Despite the cautious sense of progress at the UN meeting, some major questions remain. Many countries including China and India haven't yet submitted new carbon cutting plans, as they are expected to do before the summit. Just as important, the developed world is still scrambling to come up with the $100bn per annum that's meant to flow to the developing world from 2020.  With just five weeks left until Glasgow, diplomats are working hard to try and secure a figure that has become a symbol of trust between rich and poor nations.  To get to the key number may require some creative accounting.  \"One of the things that is floating around but is by no means certain to land, is this idea of $500bn over five years,\" Jennifer Tollman told BBC News.  \"It's something I've heard come up more and more frequently, it's not going to be $100bn in 2021, but maybe that needs to be $120bn by 2022.\" Coal is one of the other major questions.  It will be part of the discussions next week in Milan at what is termed the Pre-COP meeting. But critically it will also be on the agenda when the heads of the  G20 group of countries  gather in Rome, just days before Glasgow.  The G20 nations represents 80% of global emissions - if they can agree a strong statement that signals that coal has no future, this will be a major boost for COP26. \"The next 5 weeks are key,\" said Laurence Tubiana, from the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris agreement.  \"In particular we need G20 countries to deliver when they meet in Rome, and for those countries yet to submit stronger plans to do so - now!\"  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Scientists are warning politicians immersed in climate change policy not to forget that the world is also in the midst of a plastic waste crisis.  They fear that so much energy is being expended on emissions policy that tackling plastic pollution will be sidelined.    A paper from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Bangor University says plastic pollution and climate change are not separate. It says the issues are actually intertwined - and each makes the other worse.  Manufacturing plastic items adds to greenhouse gas emissions, while extreme weather such as floods and typhoons associated with a heating planet will disperse and worsen plastic pollution in the sea. The researchers highlight that marine species and ecosystems, such as coral reefs, are taking a double hit from both problems.  Reefs and other vulnerable habitats are also suffering from the seas heating, from ocean acidification, pollution from farms and industry, dredging, development, tourism and over-fishing.  And in addition, sea ice is a major trap for microplastics, which will be released into the ocean as the ice melts due to warming.   The researchers want politicians to address all these issues \u2013 and not to allow climate change to take all the policy \u201cbandwidth\u201d. Professor Heather Koldewey from ZSL said: \u201cClimate change is undoubtedly one of the most critical global threats of our time. Plastic pollution is also having a global impact; from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest parts of our ocean.  \u201cBoth are having a detrimental effect on ocean biodiversity; with climate change heating ocean temperatures and bleaching coral reefs, to plastic damaging habitats and causing fatalities among marine species.  \u201cThe compounding impact of both crises just exacerbates the problem. It\u2019s not a case of debating which issue is most important, it\u2019s recognising that the two crises are interconnected and require joint solutions.\u201d   This video can not be played Professor Koldewey added: \u201cThe biggest shift will be moving away from wasteful single-use plastic and from a linear to circular economy that reduces the demand for damaging fossil fuels.\u201d  Helen Ford, from Bangor University, who led the study, said: \u201cI have seen how even the most remote coral reefs are experiencing widespread coral death through global warming-caused mass bleaching. Plastic pollution is yet another threat to these stressed ecosystems.   \u201cOur study shows that changes are already occurring from both plastic pollution and climate change that are affecting marine organisms across marine ecosystems and food webs, from the smallest plankton to the largest whale.\u201d  ZSL is\u202furging\u202fworld governments and policy makers to put nature at the heart of all\u202fdecision making\u202fin order\u202fto\u202fjointly\u202ftackle the\u202fcombined\u202fglobal threats of climate change and biodiversity\u202floss.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played With the jeers of Greta Thunberg ringing in their ears, climate ministers are holding final talks before a key UN conference in Glasgow.  The Swedish activist criticised the efforts of politicians to tackle climate change as \"30 years of blah, blah, blah\". But despite the mockery, ministers say some progress is being made on a range of issues.  The meeting in Italy's financial capital Milan lasts until Saturday. Earlier this week Greta Thunberg lambasted the efforts of political leaders at a youth climate summit.  She was one of 400 young people who came to Milan to formulate a response to rising temperatures that will be presented to ministers here on Thursday. Ms Thunberg will also meet Italy's prime minister Mario Draghi. Officials believe that despite the criticism about the slow pace of progress, the wheels are beginning to move on a number of fronts.  Last week at the UN General Assembly,  announcements from China  and the US on coal and climate finance, helped improve the prospects for the upcoming UN conference, known as COP26. Negotiators meeting at this \"pre-COP\" event are under pressure to clear the way for their bosses, the world's presidents and prime ministers who will meet in Glasgow at the start of COP26 in early November. One of the big issues holding up progress is the question of money.  Despite significant new promises, the wealthy nations are still around $20bn short of the long-promised $100bn a year that's meant to help poorer countries cope with rising temperatures. \"Isn't it ridiculous, that in the midst of a trillion dollar emergency response economy that we're seeing right now, we are haggling over a $20bn price tag to essentially unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars of developing country investments,\" said the head of  UNDP  Achim Steiner. Mr Steiner is a senior leader in the UN and has been a close observer of the climate talks process for many years.  \"Time is running out, and we can't find a way in which we can finance this? It's just not acceptable,\" he told BBC News. While ministers will look to make progress on cash and other outstanding questions in their discussions here over the next few days, they will be heartened by new research showing that the 1.5C temperature threshold can be kept in sight at a relatively low cost over the next decade. The  report comes from the Energy Transitions Commission , a group made up of leaders from the energy industry, finance and climate advocacy.   They outline six actions that could be taken by companies and countries which would go beyond the carbon cutting plans and would limit warming to 1.5C. The key steps include: \"The 1.5C threshold is absolutely technologically possible at costs which the global economy could easily absorb,\" said Adair Turner, the chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. \"We broadly know the categories of what is possible. We have provided, we think, a robust quantification of what's possible. And there are specific initiatives which could be taken in addition to country's carbon cutting plans, which would get us there.\" \"And we need them because we're running out of time.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Joe Whitwell BBC News \"It's a kind of hopelessness I guess. Helplessness,\" says Ross Simpson, 22, from Glasgow. He's telling me how he and his friends feel about stopping the worst effects of climate change.  The warnings keep coming of more heatwaves, droughts, floods, and global temperatures going up and up and up. Seeing so many negative stories in the news only makes Ross feel worse.  Like many, he worries it's already too late.  \"What difference does changing your lifestyle actually make in the grand scheme of things? Why do anything, if we're all doomed anyway?\" Noor Elmasry, 22, has been having similar conversations with her friends across the Atlantic, in Chicago. \"I think a lot of the frustration manifests from seeing people in power just constantly disappoint you,\" she says. Their feelings are shared by young people around the world.  In a recent survey , 10,000 young people were asked about climate change. Three quarters said the future of the world was frightening, while more than half said they thought humanity was doomed.  Feelings of fear, shame, guilt, anger and frustration have been given a name: climate anxiety. And it's on the rise.  So what can you do if you're worried the planet is doomed? The BBC asked a group of scientists who have been working on climate change for years about what worked for them.  Repeatedly, scientists said taking action in their own lives helped to ease their anxieties.  Many were proud of the scientific work they had been part of, but some also spoke about doing simpler things: recycling, eating a plant-based diet, insulating their homes, going on marches and engaging with politics.  Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist who contributed to a  major report on climate change this year , said she occasionally planted mango saplings by the roadside.  Would it save the world on its own? No. Did it make her feel a bit better? Yes.  The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Dr Jonathan Foley has worked on climate change for three decades as a researcher, author and government advisor and now investigates climate change solutions.  He says action is the antidote that works for him, and points out that it can take many forms.   \"Some people might become activists because they're really angry and they want to shake things up. Great, we need that. Others could be artists and want to share how they feel and inspire others. Great, we need that too. We need everybody.\" Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, found relief in being alongside like-minded people at protests, rallies and other events.  \"It's an atmosphere you can't beat,\" she says. \"As soon as you meet other people who have the same concerns, you're like, 'okay, I would much rather be here'.\" Read more about the COP26 summit here. The choice for her is often between \"doomscrolling\" - staring at a phone or computer and dwelling on negative news - or working on solutions with like-minded people. \"Everyone's in the same boat, right? So there's a huge amount of solidarity,\" she says. \"I got a lot of meaning by knowing what we're doing might really change things.\" She says the pandemic has made that hard for many people, but adds: \"I really hope that people can feel like they can start that stuff again.\" Almost all the scientists shared stories about coming to terms with how they felt about climate change. \"I've felt terrified,\" says Dr Jones.  \"I've felt incredibly angry at fossil fuel interests who have delayed action for so long. I've felt frustration at politicians. I've gone through real helplessness.\"   \"We've all been there,\" Dr Jones adds. \"Everyone who works on climate has been there. For me that was like 10 years ago. You have to acknowledge these things and come to some level of acceptance.\" But what does acceptance actually look like? Dr Jones says she spoke to friends and a counsellor. She continues to keep a journal to write down her feelings.  \"For me, I don't know how to process thoughts and feelings without writing them down. The main thing is getting it all out of your head. If it stays there it just turns into a big unhelpful stew.\" Caroline Hickman has studied the impact on climate change on the mental health of young people and helped lead the survey of 10,000 young people.  \"We need to pay attention to how we feel and to process these complex feelings and support others in dealing with how they feel, as we take action in world,\" she says. \"Otherwise, there's a high risk of burnout, because we're tired.\" She says feelings of anxiety are normal. \"It's an emotionally, mentally healthy response to feel anxiety, dread, despair, depression in relation to the climate emergency.\" Yet many of the scientists had a stubborn optimism that comes from working on the problem. You will have good days and bad days, Dr Foley says.  \"Maybe that's how you feel some days,\" he says when I ask him about feeling down. \"But I hope you come back and maybe roll up your sleeves and see that actually maybe doom isn't guaranteed.\" What was agreed at COP26?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Milan Rich countries' plans to curb carbon are \"smoke and mirrors\" and must be urgently improved, say poorer nations.  Ministers meeting here in Milan at the final UN session before the  Glasgow COP26  climate conference heard that some progress was being made. But officials from developing countries demanded tougher targets for cutting carbon emissions and more cash to combat climate change. One minister condemned \"selfishness or lack of good faith\" in the rich world. US special envoy John Kerry said all major economies \"must stretch\" to do the maximum they can. Around 50 ministers from a range of countries met here to try to overcome some significant hurdles before world leaders gather in Glasgow in November.  But for extremely vulnerable countries to a changing climate the priority is more ambitious carbon reductions from the rich, to preserve the 1.5C temperature target set by the 2015 Paris agreement. Scientists have warned that allowing the world temperatures to rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is highly dangerous. An assessment of the promises made so far to cut carbon suggests that the world is on track for around 2.7C. Ministers from developing countries say this is just not acceptable - they are already experiencing significant impacts on their economies with warming currently just over 1C. \"We're already on hellish ground at 1.1C,\" said Simon Steill, Grenada's environment minister who argues that the plans in place just weren't good enough to prevent disaster for his island state.  \"We're talking about lives, we're talking about livelihoods, they cannot apply smoke and mirrors to that.\" \"Every action that is taken, every decision that is taken, has to be aligned with 1.5C, we have no choice.\" Some delegates felt that richer countries aren't sufficiently engaged on the issue of 1.5C, because they are wealthy enough to adapt to the changes. \"They don't care about 1.5C because if there's sea level rise, they have the means to build sea walls, and they are just remaining there in their high walls of comfort,\" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, from the Democratic Republic of Congo.   \"Some countries are willing to do things but they don't have the means, some have the means but are not willing to do things. Now how do we find the right choreography?\" On this question of choreography, ministers were in agreement that the G20 group of countries should be leading the dance.  Mr Kerry called on India and China, who are part of the G20, to put new carbon plans on the table before leaders gather in Glasgow.  \"All G20 countries, all large economies, all need to try to stretch to do more,\" he told the gathering.  \"I'm not singling out one nation over another. But I am encouraging all of us to try to do the maximum we can.\" The mood on the street in Milan could not have contrasted more sharply with the formal, political roundtable discussions inside the PreCOP26 conference.   On Friday, students and activists marched to the doors of the conference venue - banners waving and arms linked in a human wall to protect Greta Thunberg, who led the procession. There were cheers of: \"We are unstoppable, another world is possible\". And just one day after sharing the stage with world leaders, and after meeting the Italian prime minister, 18-year-old Greta told a cheering crowd: \"We are sick of their blah blah blah and sick of their lies.\" Meanwhile, behind the concrete walls of the conference hall on Saturday, ministers were cautiously optimistic that their discussions had laid crucial foundations for the UN climate meeting in November. As he brought the meeting to a close, Alok Sharma, president for the much-anticipated COP26 in Glasgow, assured me that there was now a tangible \"sense of urgency\".   \"It's this set of world leaders that are deciding the future,\" he said. \"We're going to respond to what we've heard here from young people.\"  One of the biggest remaining hurdles to progress remains the question of finance. The richer world promised to pay developing nations $100bn a year from 2020.  That figure hasn't yet been met and while ministers here were confident it would be achieved in Glasgow, the failure to land the money is eroding trust. \"Everything we need to do, we know what that is, and now it's just a question of who's going to be paying for it, who is going to be willing to share their technology,\" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu. \"And that's where the problem is. So there seems to be at times selfishness or lack of good faith.\" Despite these reservations, the UK minister tasked with delivering success in Glasgow was in positive mood after the meeting in Milan. \"I think we go forward to Glasgow with a spirit of co-operation,\" said Alok Sharma. \"I do not want to underestimate the amount of work that is required but I think there is a renewed urgency in our discussions.\" However there are significant hurdles to clear before leaders arrive in Glasgow and technical questions about carbon markets and transparency are still unresolved.  \"We need to change. And we need to change radically, we need to change fast,\" said EU vice-president Frans Timmermans. \"And that's going to be bloody hard.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Climate change academics from some of the regions worst hit by warming are struggling to be published, according to a new analysis.  The  study  looked at 100 of the most highly cited climate research papers over the past five years. Fewer than 1% of the authors were based in Africa, while only 12 of the papers had a female lead researcher. The lack of diverse voices means key perspectives are being ignored, says the study's author.  Researchers from the Carbon Brief website examined the backgrounds of around 1,300 authors involved in the 100 most cited climate change research papers from 2016-2020.  They found that some 90% of these scientists were affiliated with academic institutions from North America, Europe or Australia.  The African continent, home to around 16% of the world's population had less than 1% of the authors according to the analysis.  There were also huge differences within regions - of the 10 authors from Africa, eight of them were from South Africa.  When it comes to lead authors, not one of the top 100 papers was led by a scientist from Africa or South America. Of the seven papers led by Asian authors, five were from China.  \"If the vast majority of research around climate change is coming from a group of people with a very similar background, for example, male scientists from the global north, then the body of knowledge that we're going to have around climate change is going to be skewed towards their interests, knowledge and scientific training,\" said Ayesha Tandon from Carbon Brief, who carried out the analysis and says that \"systemic bias\" is at play here. \"One study noted that a lot of our understanding of climate change is biased towards cooler climates, because it's mainly carried out by scientists who live in the global north in cold climates,\" she added.  There are a number of other factors at play that limit the opportunities for researchers from the global south. These include a lack of funding for expensive computers to run the computer models, or simulations, that are the bedrock of much climate research. Other issues include a different academic culture where teaching is prioritised over research, as well as language barriers and a lack of access to expensive libraries and databases. Even where researchers from better-off countries seek to collaborate with colleagues in the developing world, the efforts don't always work out well.  One researcher originally from Tanzania but now working in Mexico explained what can happen.  \"The northern scientist often brings his or her own grad students from the north, and they tend to view their local partners as facilitators - logistic, cultural, language, admin - rather than science collaborators,\" Dr Tuyeni Mwampamba from the Institute of Ecosystems and Sustainability Research in Mexico told Carbon Brief.  Researchers from the north are often seen as wanting to extract resources and data from developing nations without making any contribution to local research, a practice sometimes known as \"helicopter science\". For women involved in research in the global south there are added challenges in getting your name on a scientific paper \"Women tend to have a much higher dropout rate than men as they progress through academia,\" said Ayesha Tandon. \"But then women also have to contend with stereotypes and sexism, and even just cultural norms in their country or from the upbringing that might prevent them from spending as much time on their science or from pursuing it in the way that men do.\" The analysis suggests that the lack of voices from women and from the global south is hampering the global understanding of climate change.   Solving the problem is not going to be easy, according to the author.  \"This is a systemic problem and it will progress and keep getting worse, because people in positions of power will continue to have those privileges,\" said Ayesha Tandon. \"It's a problem that will not just go away on its own unless people really work at it.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Shukman Science editor Hundreds of people could die in floods in the UK, the Environment Agency has warned in a hard-hitting report that says the country is not ready for the impact of climate change.  Earlier this year in Germany,  dozens of people died  in floods.  \"That will happen in this country sooner or later\" unless the UK becomes more resilient to increasingly violent weather, the agency concludes. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, said: \"It is adapt or die.\" The apocalyptic tone is deliberately intended to startle governments, companies and communities into preparing for global warming effects such as higher sea levels and more extremes of rainfall and drought. The new report, seen by the BBC ahead of its publication on Wednesday, assesses the country's readiness to cope with the many different risks of climate change. In its response, environment department Defra said it was taking key measures to protect the UK from the effects of global warming. We are currently heading for an increase in the global average temperature of just under 3C by the end of the century. But the agency projects that even a smaller rise of 2C would have severe consequences: According to Ms Howard Boyd: \"We can successfully tackle the climate emergency if we do the right things, but we are running out of time to implement effective adaptation measures. \"Some 200 people died in this summer's flooding in Germany. That will happen in this country sooner or later, however high we build our flood defences - unless we also make the places where we live, work and travel resilient to the effects of the more violent weather the climate emergency is bringing.\" Read more about the COP26 summit here. The agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, closer partnerships between government and businesses, and projects to restore natural systems that absorb carbon and hold back rainwater. Ms Howard Boyd added: \"With the right approach we can be safer and more prosperous. So let's prepare, act and survive.\" The loss of life in Germany last July is a reminder of the last time flooding led to a massive death toll in the UK. Back in 1953, a storm surge killed 307 people in England and 19 in Scotland. That tragedy forced a radical rethink about flood protection and a massive investment in coastal defences that eventually led to the Thames Barrier in London. Now, as officials across the UK weigh up future phases of flood defence, the report identifies what it calls five \"reality checks\" about climate change: The agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, saying that \"business as usual\" approaches are no longer adequate. In practical terms, that means better co-ordination between companies, national agencies and local authorities, with businesses and homeowners encouraged to take basic steps to flood-proof their own properties.  It wants more investment in natural ways of reducing flood risk, such as restoring upland areas that can retain rainwater upstream and improving management of the soil so there's less run-off.  The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. The agency also suggests trialling new arrangements and technologies for warning local communities about flood risks, and having closer coordination with other emergency services.  The agency acknowledges that billions of pounds have been spent on flood defences - and that more is earmarked. And it recognises that the UK, as host of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month, is highlighting the importance of helping communities and nature adapt to climate change. In response, Defra highlighted several key measures designed to adapt to a changing climate: \u00a35.2bn to protect 336,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion better; a national framework to manage water supplies; and a \u00a3640m Nature for Climate Fund to tackle climate change and adaptation together. A spokesperson said: \"We are taking robust action to improve resilience to climate change across the whole country and economy, and adaptation to climate change is integrated in policies throughout government. \"We're also using our COP26 presidency to drive climate adaptation around the world, protecting communities and natural habitats.\" Follow David  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Carbon emissions are rebounding strongly and are rising across the world's 20 richest nations, according to a new study.  The  Climate Transparency Report  says that CO2 will go up by 4% across the G20 group this year, having dropped 6% in 2020 due to the pandemic. China, India and Argentina are set to exceed their 2019 emissions levels.  The authors say that the continued use of fossil fuels is undermining efforts to rein in temperatures.  With just two weeks left until the critical  COP26 climate conference  opens in Glasgow, the task facing negotiators is stark.  One of the key goals of the gathering is to take steps to keep the important 1.5C temperature threshold alive and within reach.  With the world currently around 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times, limiting future incremental increases is extremely challenging.  If Glasgow is going to succeed on this question, then the countries that create the most carbon will have to put ambitious policies into place.  The evidence from this new report is that it isn't happening fast enough. The G20 group is responsible for around 75% of global emissions, which fell significantly last year as economies were closed down in response to Covid-19. But this year's rebound is being powered by fossil fuel, especially coal. According to the report, compiled by 16 research organisations and environmental campaign groups, coal use across the G20 is projected to rise by 5% this year.  This is mainly due to China who are responsible for around 60% of the rise, but increases in coal are also taking place in the US and India.  Coal use in China has surged with the country experiencing increased demand for energy as the global economy has recovered.  Coal prices are up nearly 200% from a year ago.  This in turn has seen  power cuts  as it became uneconomical for coal-fired electricity plants generate electricity in recent months.  With the Chinese government announcing a change in policy this week to allow these power plants to charge market rates for their energy, the expectation is that this will spur even more coal use this year. When it comes to gas, the Climate Transparency Report finds that use is up by 12% across the G20 in the 2015-2020 period.  The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. While political leaders have promised that the global recovery from Covid should have a green focus, the financial commitments made by rich nations don't bear this out.  Of the $1.8tn that has been earmarked for recovery spending, just $300bn will go on green projects.  To put that figure into context, it almost matches the $298bn spent by G20 countries in subsidising fossil fuel industries in the eighteen months up to August 2021.  The report also points to some positive developments including the growth of solar and wind energy in richer countries, with record amounts of new capacity installed across the G20 last year.  Renewables now supply around 12% of power compared to 10% in 2020. Politically, there has been significant progress as well with the G20 group as the majority recognise that net zero targets are needed for around the middle of this century. All members of the group have agreed to put new 2030 carbon plans on the table before the Glasgow conference.  This video can not be played However, China, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia have not yet done so. \"G20 governments need to come to the table with more ambitious national emission reductions targets. The numbers in this report confirm we can't move the dial without them - they know it, we know it - the ball is firmly in their court ahead of COP26,\" said Kim Coetzee from Climate Analytics, who coordinated the overall analysis. There are expectations that both India and China will submit new national plans before the meeting in Glasgow, which could give a significant boost to attempts to keep the 1.5C target in view.  The G20 group will meet in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 and the UK minister who will lead the talks has in recent days urged the leaders of these countries to now step up. \"It is leaders who made a promise to the world in Paris six years ago, and it is leaders that must honour it,\" said Alok Sharma. \"Responsibility rests with each and every country, and we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed, or fail, as one.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By David Brown BBC News China's carbon emissions are vast and growing, dwarfing those of other countries.  Experts agree that without big reductions in China's emissions, the world cannot win the fight against climate change. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060.  His statement has now been confirmed as China's official position ahead of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.   While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, China is facing the biggest challenge.  Per person, China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions.  Your device may not support this visualisation China became the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world's overall greenhouse gas emissions.  It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over its commitments to reduce these.  Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015, China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C. China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker, an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".   Getting China's emissions down is achievable, according to many experts, but will require a radical shift. Coal has been the country's main source of energy for decades. President Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and will  not build new coal-fired projects abroad  - but some governments and campaigners  say the plans are not going far enough .  Researchers at  Tsinghua University in Beijing say  China will need to stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production.  And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with many sites having more than one plant. New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.    It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will have to be written off after minimal use.  China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its economy and reducing poverty. In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to  increase production  to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages in several regions of the country in recent weeks. Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from nuclear and renewables by 2050. In moving towards that goal, China's lead in the manufacture of green technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big help.  China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air pollution, a serious problem for many cities.  But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential, providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing China's dependence on foreign oil and gas. \"China is already leading the global energy transition,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and cheaper green technology is China.\"  China generates more solar power than any other country. That might not be so impressive given China's enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading. China's wind power installations were more than triple those of any other country in 2020. China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to hit the target early.  China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that are electric, but given its huge size, China makes and buys more electric cars than any other country by a considerable margin.  Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered. By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully electric-powered or hybrid. Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account manufacturing and charging sources.  But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents.  This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with  road vehicles  being the largest emitters.  China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity of those produced by the rest of the world combined. Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from renewable sources on a previously impossible scale. Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn't mean that China will stop producing emissions. It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what's left, through a combination of different approaches. Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants absorb carbon dioxide. Here again, there is encouraging news. China is  getting greener  at a faster rate than any other country, largely as a result of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and pollution. It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer.  The world needs China to succeed.  \"Unless China decarbonises, we're not going to beat climate change,\" says prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment Centre. China has some big advantages, particularly its capacity to stick to long-term strategies and mobilise large-scale investments.   The Chinese authorities are facing a colossal task.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Plans by governments to extract fossil fuels up to 2030 are incompatible with keeping global temperatures to safe levels, says the UN. The  UNEP production gap report  says countries will drill or mine more than double the levels needed  to keep the 1.5C threshold alive.  Oil and gas recovery is set to rise sharply with only a modest decrease in coal.  There has been little change since the first report was published in 2019. With the COP26 climate conference just over a week away, there is already a huge focus on the carbon-cutting ambitions of the biggest emitters.  But despite the flurry of net zero emission goals and the increased pledges of many countries, some of the biggest oil, gas and coal producers have not set out plans for the rapid reductions in fossil fuels that scientists say are necessary to limit temperatures in coming years.  Earlier this year, researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  warned of the dangers for humanity  of allowing temperatures to rise by more than 1.5C this century. To keep under this threshold will require cuts in carbon emissions of around 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels.   But instead of curbing carbon, many of the biggest emitting countries are also planning to significantly increase their production of fossil fuels, according to the UN.  The production gap report finds that countries plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuel than would be compatible with a 1.5C temperature rise by the end of this century. The plans are around 45% more than what's needed to keep the temperature rise to 2C.  According to the study, coal production will drop but gas will increase the most over the next 20 years, to levels that are simply incompatible with the Paris agreement.  The report profiles 15 major production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK.  Most governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, the authors say. \"The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,\" says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report from the Stockholm Environment Institute.  \"However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn.\" While countries have devoted far more of their recovery spending after the Covid pandemic towards fossil fuel activities, there are some positives when it comes to financing.  Funding for oil, coal and gas from multilateral banks has decreased significantly in recent years - and also from some of the richer nations.  \"This report shows, once again, a simple but powerful truth: we need to stop pumping oil and gas from the ground if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica's minister for environment and energy.  \"We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously. That is why, together with Denmark, we are leading the creation of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to put an end to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, plan a just transition for workers and start winding down existing production in a managed way.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Gordon Corera Security correspondent Climate change will lead to growing international tensions, the US intelligence community has warned in a bleak assessment. The first ever National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change looks at the impact of climate on national security through to 2040. Countries will argue over how to respond and the effects will be felt most in poorer countries, which are least able to adapt. The report also warns of the risks if futuristic geo-engineering technologies are deployed by some countries acting alone. The 27-page assessment is the collective view of all 18 US intelligence agencies. It is their first such look-ahead on what climate means for national security. The report paints a picture of a world failing to co-operate, leading to dangerous competition and instability. It has been issued just ahead of President Joe Biden attending next month's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which is seeking international agreement. It warns countries will try to defend their economies and seek advantage in developing new technology. Some nations may also resist the desire to act, with more than 20 countries relying on fossil fuels for greater than 50% of total export revenues. \"A decline in fossil fuel revenue would further strain Middle Eastern countries that are projected to face more intense climate effects,\" the report says. Soon, it warns, the impact of climate change will be felt around the globe. The US intelligence community identifies 11 countries and two regions where energy, food, water and health security are at particular risk. They tend to be poorer and less able to adapt, increasing the risks of instability and internal conflict. Heat waves and droughts could place pressure on services like electricity supply.  Five of the 11 countries are in South and East Asia - Afghanistan, Burma, India, Pakistan and North Korea - four countries are in Central America and the Caribbean - Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua. Colombia and Iraq are the others. Central Africa and small states in the Pacific are also at risk. Instability could spill out, particularly in the form of refugee flows, with a warning this could put pressure on the US southern border and create new humanitarian demands. The Arctic is likely to be one, as it becomes more accessible because of reducing ice. That may open new shipping routes and access to fish stocks but also create risks of miscalculation as militaries move in. Access to water will also become a source of problems. In the Middle East and North Africa, about 60% of surface water resources cross boundaries. Pakistan and India have long-standing water issues. Meanwhile, the Mekong River basin could cause problems between China and Cambodia and Vietnam, the report warns. Another source of risk is that a country might decide to use geo-engineering to counter climate change. This involves using futuristic technology, for instance sending reflective particles to the upper stratosphere which mimic the cooling effects of a volcanic eruption or using aerosols to cool oceans in a particular area. But if one country acts alone it could simply shift the problem to another region and create anger from other nations impacted in a negative way or unable to act themselves. Researchers in several countries, including Australia, China, India, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as several EU members, are looking at these techniques but there are few rules or regulations. The report says there are some ways this bleak future might be avoided. Breakthrough technologies, including accepted use of geo-engineering, are some. Another is a climate disaster which acts as a spur for greater co-operation. The report is a sign that climate is now a central part of security thinking and that it will heighten existing problems as well as create new ones. \"Governments increasingly recognise that climate change is shaping the national security landscape like never before,\" Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate and Security who formerly worked on the National Intelligence Council, told the BBC. \"Climate considerations cannot be separated from other security concerns, such as competition with China. That country faces compounding climate risks, from rising sea levels affecting millions of people in coastal cities, flooding in its interior that threatens energy infrastructure, and desertification and migrating fish stocks that undermine its food security. National security strategy that does not take such factors into account will get answers to key questions about China's behaviour incorrect.\" The new intelligence estimate sets out the stark problems that lie ahead. But the real question will be what policymakers do about this warning from their spies. This video can not be played The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt & Tom Gerken BBC News A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change. The leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. It also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. This \"lobbying\" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November. The leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. The leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change. These \"assessment reports\" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change. These reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference.  The authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus. The comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report. The cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News. The leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends.  An adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands \"phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales\u2026' should be eliminated from the report\". One senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference.  Saudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter. A senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the \"tremendous challenges\" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal.  A number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that \"the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels\".   Argentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels.   The draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says \"there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets\" as set out by the Paris Agreement. Australia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to \"delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'.\" When approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: \"The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind.\" This video can not be played The IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports.  \"Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters\", the IPCC told the BBC. \"The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports. Professor Corinne le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports. She says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from.  \"There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,\" she told the BBC. \"If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports.\" She says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science.  \"The more the reports are scrutinised\", says Professor le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, \"the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science\". Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process. \"Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads.\" The United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change. Brazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  The draft report states \"plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet\". Brazil says this is incorrect.  Both countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to \"plant-based diets\" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a \"high carbon\" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international \"Meatless Monday\" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report. The South American nation recommends \"avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options\", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions.  On the same theme, Brazil says \"plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions\" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food.  Brazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect. A significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets. It was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met. Australia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as \"subjective commentary\".  The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: \"While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool. \"Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support.\"  A number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets.    India goes even further, arguing \"almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy\". It argues it is an \"established technology\" with \"good political backing except in a few countries\".  The Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda.  Do you have any questions about the leak of climate documents? Email  haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk .

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent There are no simple solutions to complex problems like climate change. But there have been times in the past when the world has come together to try to fix an environmental crisis.  How did we deal with acid rain, for example, or the hole in the ozone layer? And are there lessons for tackling the bigger issue of global warming? It's the 1980s, and fish are disappearing in rivers across Scandinavia. Trees in parts of the forests are stripped bare of leaves, and in North America some lakes are so devoid of life their waters turn an eerie translucent blue.  The cause: Clouds of sulphur dioxide from coal-burning power plants are travelling long distances in the air and falling back to Earth in the form of acidic rain.  \"In the '80s, essentially the message was that this was the largest environmental problem of all time,\" says Peringe Grennfelt, a Swedish scientist who played a key role in highlighting the dangers of acid rain.   Headlines warning of the threats of acid rain were commonplace. For years there had been obfuscation, denial and diplomatic stand-offs, but once the science was settled beyond doubt, calls for action quickly gathered momentum. It led to international agreements curbing the pollutants from burning fossil fuels that acidify rain. Amendments to the Clean Air Act in the US saw the development of a cap and trade system, giving companies an incentive to reduce emissions of sulphur and nitrogen, and trade any excess allowances. Each year, the cap was ratcheted down until emissions dropped dramatically.  So did it work? Acid rain is now largely a thing of the past in Europe and North America, although it remains a problem elsewhere, particularly in Asia.  However, Canadian scientist John Smol, a young researcher back in the 1980s, says in many ways acid rain was a \"success story\", showing that countries can come together and deal with an international problem. \"If you don't price pollution, people will pollute. We learned that for sure,\" he says. In 1985, news of another looming environmental problem hit the headlines. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) alerted the world to a large and expanding hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic. It was caused by the chlorofluorocarbons -  greenhouse gases better known as CFCs - then used in aerosols and refrigerants.  \"Suddenly it goes 'boom', and it drops really quickly,\" says BAS polar scientist Anna Jones, referring to the dramatic thinning of the band of gas that shields the planet from harmful UV rays.  Ozone over the Antarctic had been diminishing since the 1970s, but news the hole now covered the entire Antarctic continent triggered worldwide alarm. In 1987, world leaders signed the landmark Montreal Protocol, hailed as one of the most successful environmental treaties of all time.  Ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out, with industry switching to \"CFC-free\" aerosol cans that appealed to green consumers. \"It was a global problem, but industry, the scientists, the policymakers came together,\" says Dr Jones.  \"They acted quickly; they acted with a mechanism that allowed continual tightening of that protocol. It's a very important template for how you can make things work.\"  Despite the success of the Montreal Protocol, there have been setbacks. It was discovered that hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, were potent greenhouse gases.  And there was a mysterious spike in CFCs traced to China. Both led to further action. And while the ozone hole is \"on the road to recovery\", ozone-depleting chemicals stay in the atmosphere for a long time, meaning repair is a long, slow process.  For decades we used leaded petrol as fuel - as companies added lead additives to help petrol burn more efficiently. Leaded petrol releases lead particles into vehicle exhausts that can be breathed in, causing a variety of health problems, including heart attacks, strokes and impaired mental development in children. After a long battle between scientists, regulatory authorities and industry, a consensus around the health risks emerged, and rich nations banned leaded petrol from the 1980s onwards.   Use in developing countries lingered on, however, owing to the fuel being cheaper to produce than unleaded petrol. Following a long campaign by NGOs, industry groups and governments, under the umbrella of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the final drop of leaded petrol was pumped into a car's tank only months ago.  And while the world has officially eradicated leaded fuel, lead pollution lingers on in the environment in dust and soil, where it can persist for a long time. With climate change dominating the news agenda, we hear very little nowadays about the likes of the ozone hole. Yet, there are parallels between these crises and the monumental one that is climate change.  For a long time, acid rain was a source of international conflict, with some denying its very existence and the fossil fuel industry pitted against environmentalists. Does that sound familiar?  According to Prof Smol, the debates and discussions over acid rain were training for the more complex issues of climate change. \"The first lesson I learned was that we had to effectively communicate the results of our studies, not just to other scientists but to policymakers and the public at large,\" he says.  \"If there is an information vacuum, it will be immediately filled by vested interest groups.\"  Prof Smol says the situation is even more complicated today, with the growth of social media and the spread of misinformation.   When it comes to the international push to eliminate leaded fuel, Rob de Jong, head of UNEP's sustainable mobility unit, says a key lesson was the value of a harmonised approach. \"The whole leaded petrol campaign heavily invested in public awareness, heavily invested in social and community action, heavily invested in focusing on the impact this has on children.\" And the steps taken by the international community to reduce ozone-depleting chemicals show - on a smaller scale - the kind of co-operation that will be needed to tackle the warming world.  \"The climate change problem is much more complicated to solve than the ozone problem because we don't have immediate alternatives to fossil fuels in the way that we had alternatives to CFCs,\" says Dr Jones. \"But, that's not a reason for not doing something - the problem is too important, it's too big and they need to get on with it.  \"When industry and governments have come together in the past they have solved a globally-threatening environmental problem - now they need to show they can do it again.\"  Follow Helen  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change.  But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans?  Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.   The  average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850 . Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century.  These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by  weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites .  Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era.  Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time.  Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate. This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years.  Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere. We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy.  Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period.  There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature.  Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources -  has risen significantly since 1850 .   Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm. Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.   They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate.  Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.   The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us.  Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include: There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past. Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that  there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic .  That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present.  A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities . There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times,  the tropics could have become \"dead zones\" , too hot for most species to survive. These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Ni\u00f1o. For many years, groups of so-called climate \"sceptics\" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming.  However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.   A key UN report released in 2021 said it \"is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\".  The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Top image credit: Getty Images.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Leading global coal and gas supplier Australia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison however said the plan would not include ending Australia's fossil fuel sectors. The nation will also not set ambitious targets for 2030 - an objective of next month's COP26 global climate summit. His plan has drawn criticism, with Murdoch University fire ecology expert Joe Fontaine saying it had \"all the strength of a wet paper bag\". Australia has long dragged its heels on climate action. It has some of the highest emissions per head of population and is a massive exporter of fossil fuels. Strategic allies the US and UK have both pledged to cut emissions faster. The UK has pledged that  all its electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035 , while the  US has announced plans to halve its emissions by 2030  compared to 2005 levels.  \"We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It's about getting it done,\" Mr Morrison wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday. To halt the worst effects of climate change, nations have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050.  This requires cutting emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, scientists say. Over 100 nations have committed to carbon neutrality.  Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology. Mr Morrison announced an investment of more than A$20bn (\u00a311bn; $15bn) in \"low-emissions technologies\" over the next 20 years - such as efforts to capture carbon in soil, lower solar energy costs, and developing greener industries.  But Australia will also use more gas, at least in the short term. Most controversially, there is no plan to limit fossil fuels.  \"We want our heavy industries, like mining, to stay open, remain competitive and adapt, so they remain viable for as long as global demand allows,\" Mr Morrison wrote. Australia's 2030 commitment will remain a 26% cut on 2005 emissions. It is currently on track for a 30-35% reduction, the government said.  While the 2050 pledge has been widely welcomed, the government has been ferociously criticised for not offering more details. Australia's Climate Council think tank said it was \"a joke without strong emissions cuts this decade\".  Many said the government has been too slow on climate action, despite seeing first-hand impacts such as bushfires, floods and drought. \"The word plan doesn't constitute a plan no matter how many times you say it,\" said Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Scott Morrison's announcement is worth noting not because it offers anything different to other countries, but because of how late to the party Australia is! This announcement took months of political wrangling and was left down to the wire with days before the COP26 summit in Glasgow.  That the government had to make political concessions to its junior coalition partner - the National Party - shows you how complicated and politically divisive climate action is in Australia.  The Nationals represent electorates in regional areas where most high-emission industries like coal mining are based. After days of toing and froing, they backed the 'process'.  The prime minister assured Australians the target will not mean paying more for their energy bills. \"Technology not taxes,\" he said.  He addressed regional Australians directly and said the plan won't involve shutting down coal and gas production or exports. He talked about billions of dollars invested in low-emission technologies. The government's plan would \"strike a balance\", Mr Morrison said.  But he failed to explain how this balance will be struck. How the government will square keeping its coal industry, for example, and reaching net zero by 2050 - and what role technology will play in all of that. Especially when Canberra won't budge on its much-criticised 2030 targets. While this is a big moment for Australia, the details are still murky and potentially problematic on how net zero will be achieved.  The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme.  Their  Emissions Gap report  says country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts.  But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in.  Just a few days before  COP26  opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is \"another thundering wake-up call\", according to the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. This week, we've already had a study from the WMO showing that  warming gases were at a new high last year , despite the pandemic. Now in its 12th year, this Emissions Gap report looks at the nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) or carbon-cutting plans that countries have submitted to the UN ahead of COP.  These pledges run up to 2030 and have been submitted by 120 countries. Unep has also taken account of other commitments to cut warming gases not yet formally submitted in an NDC.  The report finds that when added together, the plans cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by around 7.5% compared to the previous pledges made five years ago. This is nowhere near enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within sight, say the scientists who compiled the study. To keep 1.5C alive would require 55% cuts by the same 2030 date. That means the current plans would need to have seven times the level of ambition to remain under that limit.  \"To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep. \"The clock is ticking loudly.\" According to the authors, the current pledges would see the world warm by 2.7C this century, a scenario that Antonio Guterres calls a \"climate catastrophe\". He believes the report highlights the failures of political leaders. \"The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,\" he said at the launch of the study.  \"But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe.\" As Mr Guterres suggests, there are some hopeful signs in the report.  Around 50 countries plus the EU have pledged a net zero target for the middle of this century. These strategies cover over half of greenhouse gas emissions. The Unep analysis finds that if these plans were implemented fully, this could shave 0.5C off the temperature rise by 2100.   This would bring the global temperature level down to 2.2C, which would see dramatic and deadly impacts from warming but would be a step in the right direction from where the world is currently headed.  The problem, though, is that many of these net zero goals are ambiguous, say the authors - particularly among the world's 20 richest nations, where a dozen long-term plans are said to be quite vague.  Many delay significant cuts until after 2030, raising serious doubts about whether they can really deliver net zero just 20 years later.  Another hopeful sign relates to methane. The report also says there is great potential to make progress on these emissions, which are the second largest source of warming.  Up to 20% of these emissions from fossil fuels, from waste and from agriculture could be curbed at low or no cost.  However, the opportunity to develop a far greener world as the world recovers from Covid is in danger of being lost, say the authors.  They find that around 20% of recovery investments will support renewables and the green economy. \"The huge sums spent to recover economies from Covid-19 are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost low-carbon technologies and industries. In most cases, this opportunity is not being taken,\" said Brian O'Callaghan, project manager of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, and an author on the Unep report. \"This is a particular slap in the face for vulnerable nations who are suffering the worst consequences of climate change\u2026we remain without a commitment from the highest emitters to cover the loss and damage that they have brought on the world.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic, according to the World Meteorological Organization.  The amounts of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years.  The WMO says this will drive up temperatures in excess of the goals of the Paris agreement. They worry that our warmer world is, in turn, boosting emissions from natural sources. The news comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change. \"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said on Monday. The restrictions imposed around the world during the Covid pandemic saw  an overall decline in emissions of CO2 of 5.6%. So why hasn't that fall been echoed in atmospheric concentrations - which are the subject of this latest data from the WMO? There are a number of factors involved. Around half of emissions from human activity are taken up by trees, lands and oceans. But the absorbing ability of these sinks can vary hugely, depending on temperatures, rainfall and other factors.  Another issue is that over the past decade, emissions of CO2 have increased progressively. So even though carbon output was down last year, the increase in the level in the atmosphere was still bigger than the average between 2011-2020.  According to the WMO's annual  Greenhouse Gas Bulletin , CO2 reached 413.2 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2020 and is now 149% of the pre-industrial level.  This is bad news for containing the rise in Earth's temperature. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. \"At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2C above pre-industrial levels,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. \"We are way off track.\" \"This is more than just a chemical formula and figures on a graph. It has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren,\" said Prof Taalas. The authors say the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when temperatures were 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than it is today. One of the big concerns for researchers is that the ongoing rise in temperatures may actually cause a rise in warming gases from natural sources.  Scientists are concerned that this is already happening with methane.  Although it has a shorter lifespan than CO2, methane is far more potent as a warming chemical. Around 60% of the CH4 that ends up in the atmosphere comes from human sources such as agriculture, fossil fuels, landfills and biomass burning.  The other 40% comes from the activities of microbes in natural sources such as wetlands.   Last year's rise was the biggest increase since global methane levels started rising again in 2007.  The majority of it was from natural sources.  \"If you increase the amount of precipitation in the areas of the wetlands, and if you increase the temperature, then these methane producing bacteria, produce more methane,\" said Dr Oksana Tarasova from the WMO. \"So this will only increase in the future because the temperature is going to rise. It's a big concern,\" she told BBC News.  Scientists describe these vicious cycles as feedback loops. They are also being observed in the Amazon where researchers earlier this year reported that  parts of the rainforest were now emitting more CO2 than they were absorbing .  \"The higher the temperature, the less the precipitation, the more stress goes into the trees,\" said Dr Tarasova. \"So, trees have increased mortality, they stop taking up CO2. In addition to our own emissions, we will have emissions from our forests.\" The WMO is also concerned about the rise in nitrous oxide, which comes from human activities such as the use of nitrogen fertiliser but also from natural sources. It has also risen by more than the average over the last ten years.  With just days left before world leaders gather in  Glasgow for COP26 , the news on the level of warming gases in the atmosphere is stark.  \"Greenhouse gas measurements are like skidding into a car crash. The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it,\" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway, University of London.  \"You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"Top oil executives have appeared before US lawmakers to face allegations they misled the public about climate change. Major producers were quizzed about the impact of the fossil fuels they profit from and their environmental toll. The hearing on Thursday, which Democrats hailed as historic, marked the first time oil bosses had answered questions publicly and under oath. The six-hour session saw some heated exchanges, with firms such as BP and Shell facing tough questions. \"Some of us actually have to live the future that you are all setting on fire for us,\" Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. But the executives of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell repeatedly spoke about their efforts to transition to clean energy and denied misleading the public. The session, which saw decades of lobbying and public statements by America's biggest energy firms put under the spotlight, came just days before the start of the UN's COP26 climate conference. President Joe Biden is set to fly to Glasgow for the meeting of world leaders, which is being seen as a crucial moment in the global fight against climate change. The hearing in House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing was part of a broad probe that Democrats said would last a year.  \"For far too long, Big Oil has escaped accountability for its central role in bringing our planet to the brink of a climate catastrophe,\" committee chairwoman Carolyn B Maloney said during her introduction. Questioning Exxon's CEO, she said there had been a \"clear conflict\" between what past executives had said publicly versus the the effects of the company's activities on the climate. Ms Maloney also condemned the companies for failing to provide internal documents that the committee had requested ahead of the hearings.  The committee had been seeking records relating to \"payments to shadow groups,\" public relations firms and other firms, as well as records of communications from senior executives discussing their companies' role in the climate crisis.  Ms Maloney told the executives that she intends to issue subpoenas to force them to hand over the documents.  \"I have tried very hard to obtain this information voluntarily, but the oil companies employ the same tactics they used for decades on climate policy: delay and obstruction,\" she  said. Throughout proceedings, Democrats were keen to draw parallels between their climate disinformation probe and the House's Big Tobacco investigation in the 1990s, which, after months of testimony, concluded that cigarette companies tried to conceal evidence that their products were addictive and harmful. A statement issued by the committee on Wednesday said the industry had known about the effects of global warming since 1977 but \"for decades spread denial and doubt about the harm of its products\". Michael Wirth, from Chevron, denied his firm had knowingly lied to the public.  \"While our views on climate change have developed over time, any suggestion that Chevron is engaged in an effort to spread disinformation and mislead the public on these complex issues is simply wrong,\" he said. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said his company had long recognised climate change was real but said there were \"no easy answers\" and insisted \"oil and gas will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future\".  None of the executives present agreed to a request from Democratic Representative Ro Khanna to conduct independent audits to establish whether their companies were contributing to groups that promote climate disinformation and denial.   Republicans were resounding in their criticism of the questioning directed by their Democratic counterparts. Arizona Republican Andy Biggs told the CEOs they had been \"brought here so they can beat the crap out of you\". Representative James Comer said the hearing was intended \"to deliver partisan theatre for primetime news\" and said the committee should instead be focusing on the \"pressing concerns of American citizens\".  Republicans called Neal Crabtree, a welder who lost his job after the cancellation of a major oil pipeline by Mr Biden, to testify about his family's struggles to make ends meet.  Ms Maloney, the panel's chair, said at the close of Thursday's hearing that the investigation must continue. \"I intend to issues subpoenas to the fossil fuel industry representatives here today,\" she said, adding: \"We are at code red for climate and I am committed to doing everything I can to help rescue this planet and save it for our children.\" This video can not be played UN emissions report a 'thundering wake-up call' Poll shows rising demand for climate action The odd couple blocking Biden's climate agenda Exxon wins New York climate change fight Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath & Georgina Rannard BBC News This week has seen a series of hard-hitting reports on climate change, timed for the days before the COP26 summit starts in Glasgow. The conference, which starts on Sunday, is where world leaders are being asked to promise more ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases to prevent greater temperature rises. Here, we focus on four key numbers to remember from the reports, as we head into two weeks of big speeches and backroom meetings. That's one Queen Elizabeth, who announced on Tuesday that  she would not attend COP26 in person after her doctors advised her to rest . Wasn't her role just ceremonial, you might ask? Yes, but the 95-year-old is also an experienced diplomat and her absence is a blow for UK ambitions to bring some of her lustre to the global stage. But it also gets to something bigger - COP26's guest list could affect its chances of success. If the diplomatic heavyweights don't show up, the agreements risk being less powerful. Leaders from 120 countries will be there, but Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro from Brazil are not coming, pending last-minute changes of heart. Those three countries are among the biggest polluters and the world needs them to commit to action. And then there's the impact of Covid-19.  Travel restrictions and concerns over access to Covid vaccines  for representatives from some poorer nations means some delegates from islands threatened by rising sea levels can't come.  They don't have the clout to make the big decisions, but they are the soul of COPs. They bring the lived experience of climate change to the conference - decisions made here are critical to their lives and their words carry that weight. The year when the world will finally meet its target to give $100bn to the developing world to help it absorb the impacts of climate change -  three years behind the original target of 2020 . Some of that money pays for adaptation - from something as simple as shelters for people to run to in storms, to massive improvements to sea defences or weather forecast systems. Read more about the COP26 summit here. The delay is a serious blow to trust, and could make it harder to get significant progress at the summit. For years richer countries promised to hand the money over, and have kept missing the target. Will developing countries believe that other promises will be kept? But the delegations may also decide that the money is so close to being delivered, and that action is so urgent, they are willing to put aside their anger. The amount by which global average temperature will rise compared with pre-industrial times, if no further cuts in emissions are agreed,  according to a UN report  released on Tuesday. That's significantly above the commitments in the 2015 Paris agreement to keep to any rise to 1.5C and \"well below 2C\". This figure is not a surprise and it doesn't mean that negotiators will abandon hope of keeping 1.5C alive, but it underlines the urgency behind the summit. There is a lot to play for. We've seen some significant progress on promises to reach net zero by 2050 - that would be when we stop adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than we can take out of it. In all likelihood, the conference  will see some progress on reining in emissions from various sectors, but will they be fast enough or deep enough to see cuts of 55% by 2030 which is what scientists say needs to happen to keep 1.5C alive? The finer details of the deals negotiated will make a difference. There will be questions about the common time frames - the schedules that countries agree to keep for their climate promises - and governments being transparent about successes and failures. That's how much carbon dioxide there is in our atmosphere,  according to the latest figures from the World Meteorological Organization . This is a record high, and it is a problem because CO2 is the most significant of the warming gases pushing up global temperatures. This is another warning bell ahead of COP26. One of the reasons that CO2 concentrations rose, despite the pandemic, is because trees and oceans have stopped absorbing as much carbon after deforestation and sea temperature increases. Scientists are worried about runaway climate change as these so-called carbon sinks reduce their gas absorption. If nature is kind to us, keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C is more achievable. But if planetary changes cause trees, oceans and other areas like wetlands to emit more greenhouse gases, our climate change problem becomes far more of an existential crisis than it is now. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

The roof can be too hot to walk on. \"It's very difficult,\" she says. \"We have many sleepless nights.\" Shakeela lives with her husband, daughter and three grandchildren in a windowless room in Ahmedabad. They have only a single ceiling fan to keep them cool.  Climate change means many cities in India are now hitting 50C. Densely populated, built-up areas are particularly affected by something known as the urban heat island effect. Materials like concrete trap and radiate heat, pushing temperatures higher. And there's no respite at night, when it can actually get hotter.  In homes like Shakeela's, temperatures now reach 46C. She gets dizzy in the heat. Her grandchildren suffer from rashes, heat exhaustion and diarrhoea.  Traditional methods for staying cool, like drinking buttermilk and lemon water, no longer work. Instead they've borrowed money to paint the roof of their home white. White surfaces reflect more sunlight and a coat of white paint to the roof can bring down temperatures inside by 3-4 degrees.  For Shakeela, the difference is huge; the room is cooler and the children sleep better. \"He would not sleep through the afternoon,\" she says, pointing to her sleeping grandson. \"Now he can drift off peacefully.\" This video can not be played \"I come from a place of heat,\" Sidi Fadoua says. But the heat in northern Mauritania, in west Africa, it is now too hot for many people to live and work. The heat here is not normal heat, he says. \"It's like fire.\" Sidi, 44, lives in a small village close the edge of the Sahara. He works as a salt miner in the nearby flats. The work is tough, and it's become harder as the region heats up due to climate change. \"We can't endure such temperatures,\" he says. \"We are not machines.\"  To avoid temperatures upwards of 45C in the summer, Sidi has begun to work at night. Job prospects are scarce. Those who once made a living raising livestock can no longer do it - there aren't any plants for the sheep and goats to graze.  So like an increasing number of his neighbours, Sidi has plans to migrate to the coastal city of Nouadhibou, where the ocean breeze keeps the city cooler. Locals can hitch a ride there on one of the world's longest trains, taking iron ore from nearby mines to the coast.  \"People are moving from here,\" Sidi explains. \"They cannot stand the heat anymore.\" The 20-hour ride is dangerous. Locals can sit on top of the carriages where they are exposed to heat and sunlight during the day, before temperatures plummet to near freezing at night.  In Nouadhibou, he hopes to find work in the fishing industry. The breeze may bring respite, but with increasing numbers escaping the desert heat, work opportunities are harder to find. Sidi remains hopeful.  This video can not be played Patrick Michell, chief of the Kanaka Bar First Nation, first began noticing worrying changes in the forest near his reserve in British Columbia, Canada, more than three decades ago. There was less water in the rivers, and mushrooms had stopped growing.  This summer his fears came true. A heatwave was sweeping across North America. On June 29, his home town of Lytton smashed records, reaching 49.6C. The next day, his wife sent him a photo of a thermometer reading 53C. An hour later, his town was on fire.   His daughter, Serena, eight months pregnant, scrambled to pack her children and pets into the car: \"We left with the clothes on our backs. The flames were three storeys high and right beside us.\" Patrick raced back to see if he could save the house. He'd grown up dealing with wildfires. But like the climate, the fires had changed too. \"These aren't wildfires anymore, they're infernos,\" he says. \"How do you put an inferno out?\" Despite the family's circumstances, Patrick sees what's happened as an opportunity: \"We can rebuild Lytton for the environment that's coming in the next 100 years. It's daunting, but in my heart there's that optimism.\"  \"When I was a kid the weather was not like this,\" says Joy, who lives in the Niger Delta, in Nigeria. The region is one of the most polluted regions on Earth, and hotter days and nights are increasing.  Joy provides for her family by using heat from gas flares to dry tapioca and sell it at a local market. \"I have short hair,\" Joy explains, \"because if I grow my hair long, it could burn my head if the flare shifts direction or explodes.\" But the flares are part of the problem. Oil companies use them to burn off gas that is released from the ground when they drill for oil. The flares, which rise 6m (20ft) high, are a significant source of global CO2 emissions, which contribute to climate change.  Climate change has had a devastating impact here, turning fertile lands into deserts in the north, while flash flooding has hit the south. People do not remember such extreme weather growing up. \"Most people here aren't well-informed enough to explain why the climate is changing rapidly,\" Joy says. \"But we're suspicious of the non-stop flares.\" She wants the government to ban gas flaring, even though she relies on it to provide for her family. Almost none of the oil wealth has been reinvested in Nigeria, where 98 million people live in poverty. This includes Joy and her family. For five days of work they make \u00a34 in profit.  She is not optimistic about the future. \"I think that life [on Earth] is now coming to an end.\" This video can not be played Six years ago, Om Naief began planting trees on a patch of desert by a motorway. A retired civil servant in Kuwait, she was concerned by the increasingly severe summer temperatures and worsening dust storms.  \"I spoke to some officials. They all said it was impossible to plant anything in the sand,\" she says. \"They said the land was sandy and the temperature was too high. I wanted to do something that would astonish everyone.\" Om lives in the Middle East, which is warming faster than much of the world. Kuwait is careering towards unbearable temperatures - it is regularly hotter than 50C. Some predictions suggest average temperatures will rise by 4C by 2050. Yet Kuwait's economy is dominated by fossil fuel exports.  The two patches Om planted are modest but they serve a purpose. \"Trees fend off dust, eliminate pollution, clean the air, and lower temperatures,\" she says. Hedgehogs and spiny-tailed lizards now visit the site. \"There's fresh water and shade. It's a beautiful thing.\"  Some Kuwaitis are now calling for a large-scale green belt to be planted by the government. Their shared hope is that Kuwait is ready to make a stand against the climate crisis. Om says they must protect the land and not let it dry out. \"This heat is not normal,\" Om concludes. \"This is our fathers' land. We must give back to it, because it has given us a lot.\" This video can not be played BBC News Arabic documentary team spent the past year filming in 10 extremely hot locations for the series  Life at 50C  to show how climate change and rising temperatures are impacting peoples' lives around the world.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Extreme weather events - including powerful heat waves and devastating floods - are now the new normal, says the World Meteorological Organisation. The State of the Climate report for 2021 highlights a world that is \"changing before our eyes.\" The 20-year temperature average from 2002 is on course to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. And global sea levels rose to a new high in 2021, according to the study. These latest figures for 2021 are being released early by the WMO to coincide with the start of the UN climate conference in Glasgow known as COP26. The State of the Climate report provides a snapshot of climate indicators including temperatures, extreme weather events, sea level rises and ocean conditions. The study finds that the past seven years including this one are likely to be the warmest on record as greenhouse gases reached record concentrations in the atmosphere. The accompanying rise in temperatures is propelling the planet into \"uncharted territory\" says the report, with increasing impacts across the planet.  \"Extreme events are the new norm,\" said WMO's Prof Petteri Taalas. \"There is mounting scientific evidence that some of these bear the footprint of human-induced climate change.\" Prof Taalas detailed some of the extreme events that have been experienced around the world this year.  Another worrying development, according to the WMO study, has been the rise in global sea levels. Since they were first measured by precise satellite-based systems in the early 1990s, sea levels went up by 2.1mm per year between 1993 and 2002. But from 2013 to 2021 the rise has more than doubled to 4.4mm, mostly as a result of accelerated ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets.  \"Sea levels are rising faster now than at any other time in the last two millennia,\" said Prof Jonathan Bomber, Director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. \"If we continue on our current trajectory, that rise could exceed 2m by 2100 displacing some 630 million people worldwide. The consequences of that are unimaginable.\" In temperature terms, 2021 will likely be the sixth or seventh warmest on record.  That's because the early months of this year were impacted by a La Ni\u00f1a event, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon that tends to cool global temperatures.  But the report also shows that the global temperature record is on course to breach 1C for the first time over a 20 year period. \"The fact that the 20-year average has reached more than 1.0C above pre-industrial levels will focus the minds of delegates at COP26 aspiring to keep global temperature rise to within the limits agreed in Paris six years ago,\" said Prof Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the UK Met Office, which contributed to the report. Commenting on the analysis, the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the planet was changing before our eyes.  \"From the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated,\" he said.  \"COP26 must be a turning point for people and planet,\" said Mr Guterres.

{"id":null,"body":"By Paul Rincon Science editor, BBC News website Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists. The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down. But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year. It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C. This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say. Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation.  Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels. Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: \"What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021. \"That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come.\" This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming. The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry.  This video can not be played It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN report  that suggested we would get there by the early 2030s. Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, said: \"To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.\" The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown. So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable. Read more about the COP26 summit here. \"Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,\" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter. Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 concurred: \"This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain.\" Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level. Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle. The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries. Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown.  \"China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,\" Dr Peters explained. \"But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal.  \"If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have.\" At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing. Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News Researchers studying the ocean at depths of up to 6km have found that climate change has a \"worrying\" effect on its ability to lock away carbon.  The latest discovery comes from the International  \"i-Atlantic\" project .  It has revealed that - if global temperatures increase to levels predicted - the ocean will not be able to provide what is currently Earth's largest long-term carbon store.     One third of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere dissolves in the ocean.\u00a0 It therefore acts as an important buffer against rising temperatures. Carbon is one of the chemical elements in the key planet-warming gas carbon dioxide (CO2). When that gas dissolves in the ocean, it is taken up by marine plants and animals becomes part of an ocean cycle that results in some of it being locked into the deep ocean mud for centuries. Billions of tonnes of carbon is buried in the deep ocean's muddy floor. But this latest research shows that this cycle is disrupted by rising ocean temperatures.  The study revealed a \"cycle of warming\"; ocean temperature rise causes more of this buried carbon to be released as CO2, where it can contribute to yet more global warming. In experiments carried out from the Spanish research vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa, scientists used tethered, robotic sample collectors to bring tubes of seafloor mud into their ocean laboratories.  They then incubated those samples at deep ocean temperatures that are currently predicted for the end of this century.  \"This deep 'abyssal' ocean covers 60% of our planet and we're finding that, under higher temperatures, we can store less carbon in these places,\" said Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh.  \"The ecosystems are turning the carbon over faster. They're running at a higher temperature more quickly, and they're going to release more carbon in the future.\" Prof Roberts said these experiments, which were led by Prof Andrew Sweetman's team at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, showed that human activity had changed the \"very nature\" of the vast ocean.  \"As well as our carbon emissions, the ocean has absorbed over 90% of global heating,\" he explained. \"And if we don't understand [the impact of this] well enough, we can't make the most accurate models in the future.\" The need to understand more about the ocean's response to climate change, he added, was being brought into sharp focus by the negotiations at the COP26 climate summit - about how global leaders tackle the crisis.  The same research project, funded by the European Commission, recently discovered   a dozen new ocean species in the Atlantic .   Professor Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol, who was not involved in this research, and who studies the causes and effects of climate change in the ocean, told BBC News: \"It's often said that we know more about the surface of the Moon than we do about the deep ocean, and it's true.  \"It's the largest habitat on Planet Earth.\" Because it's so vast, and so poorly understood, Prof Schmidt added, \"the worry is that we'll start destroying those ecosystems - and perturb all these vital processes - that we really don't understand\".

{"id":null,"body":"By Beth Timmins Business reporter, BBC News Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out? Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products.  And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look out for to spot greenwashing?  The Advertising Standards Authority says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have already had adverts banned. In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a  Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions without sufficient evidence  to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert,  claiming a car \"cleaned the air\", was also judged by the ASA to be misleading . Ingredients in a product being described as \"natural\", \"organic\" or \"eco-friendly\", when only some of the ingredients can be described as this, can also fall into this category.  Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims.  \"Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle be taken seriously?\" Phrases such as \"eco\", \"sustainable\" and \"green\" are commonly used by companies to make the business appear environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards.  A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016,  featured the claim \"100% eco-friendly\" . A complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation. And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk was \"good for the planet\", branding it: \"Your recipe to a healthier planet.\" Alpro said customers would understand the ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact.  But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer.  In another example, Edward Bulmer Limited claimed in 2018 that its paint was \"the most eco-friendly paint on the market\". However,  the Advertising Standards Authority held in 2019  that Edward Bulmer Limited (the company that then produced and sold Edward Bulmer Paint) \"had not supplied evidence of certification for their paints, nor had they supplied evidence which showed their paints scored more favourably in terms of their impact on the environment than other paints on the market.\" Fashion brands may promote clothes made of \"sustainable\" fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging to the environment.  For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product.  Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction of its emissions.  This video can not be played A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting. But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of actually cutting emissions.  David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of greenwashing. \"It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump emissions into the air.\" He adds: \"The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.\" Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact. Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where \"everyone pays attention to them, they are certified independently and they influence consumer decisions\".  Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: \"Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels.\" She said: \"Without this action is useless.\"  Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other products. Food company Quorn had an  ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products.  ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was.  Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly positive environmental impact. \"If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or service, take that as a warning sign.\" \"Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check out their eco credentials,\" she adds.  The \"recyclable\" label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle. In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws weren't actually recyclable.  In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or incineration.

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows. It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to. COP26 \"has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap\", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change. But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation. COP26 is expected to finish this week. The projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels. The report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26.  It concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree. Scientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening. The COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included \"pursuing efforts\" to keep warming under 1.5C. But when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. This video can not be played \"This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,\" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C. Climate Action Tracker blames \"stalled momentum\" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low. Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere. More than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions. But Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated \"acceptable\", covering a fraction of the world's emissions. \"If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,\" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker. The main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes. With one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference.  For days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C. That seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference.  So how has the confusion come about? The problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  More than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070. According to the CAT, these goals are giving \"false hope\".  Based on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C. If every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible. But the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised. That's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years.  Any deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure.  The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Iran will ratify the landmark Paris agreement on climate change only if sanctions against it are lifted, a senior leader has told the BBC. Ali Salajegheh said sanctions were impeding Iran in areas like renewable energy. Iran is the world's eighth largest CO2 emitter, yet is one of the few countries not to ratify the Paris pact.  Emissions have soared in recent years as overseas investments in renewable energy have collapsed.  The government has also violently suppressed protests about water shortages.  While the country's president Ebrahim Raisi has chosen not to come to the UN climate change summit in Glasgow, the Iranian team is here to plead for relief from the economic blockade. \"Iran has been impacted by climate change like every other place in the world,\" said Mr Salajegheh. \"This has reduced our rainfall per annum and also the inflow of water into our rivers has reduced by 40% this has affected our agriculture and affected our industrial and drinking water.\" However, Iran has been criticised for damaging its own water supply by drilling over a million wells and building around 700 dams.  On the issue of the Paris climate agreement, Mr Salajegheh said the pact had to be a \"two-way street.\" \"When you have oppressive sanctions in force it does not allow for any kind of imports even medicine which is a human fundamental right,\" he said. \"If the sanctions are removed, then we have a commitment towards the international community, it is at that time that they can transfer modern technology and finance to us especially in the area of renewable energy so we can modernise our deteriorating infrastructure,\" he told BBC News.   But can Iran be trusted on climate change?  The country had originally said that even if sanctions weren't removed they promised that CO2 would be reduced.  The reality is somewhat different, carbon pollution has in fact gone up, and the country is rated as \"critically insufficient\" on climate change by the Climate Action Tracker. The country hasn't submitted a carbon cutting plan since 2015. Experts say their emissions are likely to increase by 50% by 2030.  \"What happened was we said that we would reduce by 12% if sanctions are removed. The sanctions were not removed,\" said Mr Salajegheh.  As a country that is massively dependant on oil and gas exports, how will Iran cope in a world that will likely see a shrinking demand for fossil fuels? \"Oil and gas will end one day but if we use it in a way that brings the emissions to the minimum then we can use it as well as renewables,\" Mr Salajegheh said.  While the rest of the world is engaged in the discussions here on cutting carbon and raising finance for the developing world, there is little room for debates with Iran.  The country's representatives are here to make a point about sanctions.  Right now, they say they can't to join the global fight against climate change. But they want this to change.  \"We have come here to say that Iran is a nation engaged with the whole world. We're all part of this global village and can help each other,\" the head of their delegation said.   \"When you have an economic terrorism that has blockaded us, we are now saying remove this and we can engage with the world and then rest assured that we will be here.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Paul Rincon Science editor, BBC News website The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has been billed as a last chance to limit global warming to 1.5C.  But  beyond the deals and photo opportunities,  what are the key things countries need to do in order to tackle climate change? Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and especially coal, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures.  It's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change.  However, many major coal-dependent countries - such as Australia, the US, China and India -  have declined to sign a deal at the summit aimed at phasing out the energy source  in the coming decades.  A recent UN report has suggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency.  A substantial amount of methane is released from \"flaring\" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source. At COP26,  nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions,  in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. Electricity and heat generation make a greater contribution to global emissions than any economic sector.  Transforming the global energy system from one reliant on fossil fuels to one dominated by clean technology - known as decarbonisation - is critical for meeting current climate goals.  Wind and solar power will need to dominate the energy mix by 2050 if countries are to deliver on their  net zero targets. There are challenges, however. Less wind means less electricity generated, but better battery technology could help us store surplus energy from renewables, ready to be released when needed. We'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air.  Ditching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical.  Lorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy.  And scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take.  A UN report in 2018 said that, to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we'll have to remove CO2 from the air.  Forests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation.  Programmes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions.  Trees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be \"cancelled out\" by carbon sinks such as forests.  Emerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role.  A number of direct-air capture facilities are being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2.  Another method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at \"point sources\" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground.  However, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels.  At the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (\u00a374.6bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change.  That target date has not been met, although the UK government, as holders of the COP presidency, recently outlined a plan for putting the funding in place by 2023.  Many coal-dependent countries are facing severe energy shortages that jeopardise their recovery from Covid and disproportionately affect the poor. These factors stop them moving away from polluting industries.   Some experts believe poorer nations will need continuing financial support to help them move towards greener energy. For instance, the US, EU and UK recently provided $8.5bn to help South Africa phase out coal use.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jonathan Josephs Business reporter, BBC News The boss of the world's second biggest airline has said that tackling climate change will make flying more expensive. \"Over time, it's going to cost us all more, but it's the right approach that we must take,\" Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian told the BBC. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of the carbon emissions that are warming the planet, according to the International Energy Agency. Critics argue the best way to reduce them is by flying less. Atlanta-based Delta says that after spending $30m (\u00a322.4m) a year on carbon-offsetting it has been carbon neutral since March 2020. It has also pledged to spend $1bn over the next decade to cancel out all the emissions it creates. More fuel-efficient planes, sustainable aviation fuels and removing carbon from the atmosphere are some of the ways it hopes to achieve this. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as agreed in Paris in 2015, and has been the focus of the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Andreas Schafer, professor of energy and transport at University College London, says it will \"cost trillions rather than billions of dollars\" to move the global aviation sector to net zero carbon emissions. Preliminary results from his team's research suggest airfares would need to increase by 10%-20% to cover the costs.  \"In the short-term, government support will be needed with those costs as decarbonising aviation will be extremely challenging, and current efforts will need to be scaled up dramatically\", says Prof Schafer. Mr Bastian concedes it is an ambitious goal that his airline won't be able to achieve alone. \"It's the biggest long-term challenge this industry faces,\" he said. \"We're in an industry that's classified as hard to decarbonise because we don't have the bio-fuels or the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) en masse yet that we're going to need.\"  Delta aims to be using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030.  Many airlines and fuel companies are investing in SAFs. Other technologies being developed involve turning food waste into jet fuel and using carbon dioxide pulled out of the air. However, these still cost more than traditional jet fuels and the quantities needed are also seen as problematic.  According to the US government, global demand for jet fuel is set to  more than double  by 2050 .  The number of passenger flights is set to jump from a pre-pandemic 4.5 billion to 10 billion by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  IATA director general Willie Walsh told the BBC that while creating the levels of SAF production needed was a big challenge, \"it is perfectly possible if industry and governments work together\".  \"Production increases will bring the cost down to competitive levels. We've seen similar increases in the development of solar and wind power in recent decades.\" At the UN climate change summit in Glasgow,  23 countries have pledged  to work together to get the aviation industry to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  More efficient energy use, sustainable aviation fuels and electric aeroplanes are all part of their ambitions.  However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace says the agreement is \"brazen greenwashing\".  \"This announcement is full of scams like offsetting, and excessive optimism on so-called 'sustainable aviation fuels' and future aircraft designs,\" says Greenpeace's Klara Maria Schenk. \"But it lacks the one thing that's needed to deliver the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C which is tangible action to prioritise green travel and reduce flights.\" This video can not be played Whilst many businesses and individuals have used the pandemic as a chance to re-evaluate their carbon footprints, Mr Bastian thinks the number of flights will return to pre-pandemic levels. \"All forms of travel are on the way back. Families are the part of the travelling public that we're most happy to see, because there's been some really difficult stories over time of families not being able to connect for long [periods]\".  Business travel is also returning because video meetings can't replace everything, says Mr Bastian. \"There's a real unity and sense of purpose that we have when people get back together in person\". That desire to travel helped Delta to report a $194m profit in the three months to the end of September, its first profit since the pandemic began. Before the pandemic Delta was the world's second biggest airline, flying 200 million passengers in 2019. As of September it was operating at 71% of its pre-pandemic capacity. The recovery in its domestic US market has been fastest, with long-haul routes to Asia the slowest. That echoes the pattern seen in a  recent forecast from planemaker Boeing , which forecast a full recovery of global aviation would take until 2024. Like other airlines,  Delta has received billions in government support  to get through the pandemic, but is hopeful of a brighter future now the  US has reopened its borders  to international travellers.  This video can not be played Mr Bastian says this may take some adjusting to and there may be long queues at airports as Covid vaccines and paperwork are checked. However, he is confident in the airline's outlook and says the pandemic was \"an opportunity to invest in our future\". Now the airline is making money again he says: \"We hope to be able to maintain that and go into the new year as a profitable carrier.\" You can watch Ed Bastian's full interview on \" Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst \" this weekend on BBC World News at Saturday 23:30 GMT, Sunday 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 08:30 GMT Coronavirus: Boeing says air travel to recover by 2024 Transport route change or reverse gear?

{"id":null,"body":"By Paul Rincon Science editor, BBC News website This video can not be played A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they \"have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication\".  In the end, countries agreed to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was \"deeply sorry\" for how events had unfolded. He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would \"look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change\". \"There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,\" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it was  always unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that \"was somehow going to end the crisis\" , but that the \"starting pistol\" had been fired. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was \"hanging by a thread\". \"We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.\" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such as  millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. Main achievements of the deal: \"We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,\" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. \"This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it.\" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. \"They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,\" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. \"This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,\" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was \"nothing less than a scandal\".  \"Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,\" she said.  Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (\u00a375bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: \"We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped.\" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: \"We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.\" Climate stripes visualisation courtesy of Prof Ed Hawkins and University of Reading. Follow Paul  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Rachel Schraer & Kayleen Devlin BBC Reality Check As world leaders met at the COP26 summit to debate how to tackle climate change, misleading claims and falsehoods about the climate spiralled on social media.  Scientists say climate change denial is now more likely to focus on the causes and effects of warming, or how to tackle it, than to outright deny it exists.  The 'd-words' v the planet We've looked at some of the most viral claims of the past year, and what the evidence really says.  People have long claimed, incorrectly, that the past century's temperature changes are just part of the Earth's natural cycle, rather than the result of human behaviour.  In recent months, we've seen a new version of this argument.  Thousands of posts on social media, reaching hundreds of thousands of people over the past year, claim a \"Grand Solar Minimum\" will lead to a natural fall in temperatures, without human intervention. But this is not what the evidence shows.  A grand solar minimum is a real phenomenon when the Sun gives off less energy as part of its natural cycle.  Studies suggest the Sun may well go through a weaker phase sometime this century, but that this would lead, at most, to a  temporary 0.1 - 0.2C cooling  of the planet.  That's not nearly enough to offset human activity, which has already warmed the planet by about 1.2C over the past 200 years and will continue to rise, possibly topping 2.4C by the end of the century.  We know recent temperature rises weren't caused by the changes in the Sun's natural cycle because  the layer of atmosphere nearest the earth is warming , while the layer of atmosphere closest to the Sun - the stratosphere - is cooling.  Heat which would normally be released into the stratosphere is being trapped by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from people burning fuel. If temperature changes on Earth were being caused by the Sun, we would expect the whole atmosphere to warm (or cool) at the same time. Various posts circulating online claim global warming will make parts of the earth more habitable, and that cold kills more people than heat does. These arguments often cherry-pick favourable facts while ignoring any that contradict them.  For example, it's true that some inhospitably cold parts of the world could become easier to live in for a time.  But in these same places warming could also lead to extreme rainfall, affecting living conditions and the ability to grow crops,  At the same time, other parts of the world would become uninhabitable as a result of temperature increases and rising sea levels, like the world's lowest-lying country, the Maldives.  We face climate extinction, at-risk nations say There may be fewer cold-related deaths. According to a study published in the Lancet,  between 2000 and 2019, more people died as a result of cold weather than hot .  However, a rise in heat-related deaths is expected to cancel out any lives saved.  The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says overall, \"climate-related risks to health [and] livelihoods...are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5 degrees\". Any small local benefits from fewer cold days are expected to be outweighed by the risks of more frequent spells of extreme heat. A common claim made by those against efforts to tackle climate change is that fossil fuels have been essential to driving economic growth. So limiting their use, the argument goes, will inevitably stunt this growth and increase the cost of living, hurting the poorest. But this isn't the whole picture.  Fossil fuels have powered vehicles, factories and technology, allowing humans over the past century to make things at a scale and speed which would previously have been impossible. This enabled people to make, sell and buy more things, and become richer. But stopping using coal doesn't mean returning to the days of ox-drawn carts and hand-cranked machines - we now have other technologies that can do a similar job.  In many places, renewable electricity - powered by wind or solar energy for example - is now cheaper than electricity powered by coal, oil or gas.  On the other hand, studies predict that if we don't act on climate change by 2050, the global economy could shrink by 18% because of the damage caused by natural disasters and extreme temperatures to buildings, lives, businesses and food supplies.  Such damage would hit the world's poorest the hardest. Misleading posts claiming renewable energy failures led to blackouts went viral earlier in the year, when a massive electricity grid failure left millions of Texans in the dark and cold.  These posts, which were taken up by a number of conservative media outlets in the US, wrongly blamed the blackout on wind turbines.  \"Blackouts are an artefact of poor electricity generation and distribution management,\" says John Gluyas, executive director of the Durham Energy Institute.  He says the claim that renewable energy causes blackouts is \"nonsensical.... Venezuela has oodles of oil and frequent blackouts\".  According to Jennie King from the think tank ISD Global, this discrediting of renewable energies is a \"key line of attack for those keen to preserve reliance on, and subsidies for, oil and gas\".  Critics of renewable energy schemes also claim the technology kills birds and bats, ignoring  the studies  that estimate that  fossil fuel-powered plants kill many times more animals .  There's no doubt some wildlife, including birds, are killed by wind turbines. But according to the LSE's Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment: \"The benefits for wildlife of mitigating climate change are considered by conservation charities... to outweigh the risks, provided that the right planning safeguards are put in place, including careful site selection.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Scientists and leading climate experts have voiced concerns about the outcomes of the COP26 climate conference, in Glasgow. Those who spoke to the BBC praised the conference for getting countries to agree to meet again next year to pledge deeper emissions cuts. And they welcomed agreements on forests, innovation and especially methane - from fossil fuel extraction and livestock.  But the scientists fear politicians won\u2019t deliver. And they say the hope of holding temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is far too unambitious anyway. The experts say that with a temperature rise so far of just 1.1C, the world is already in a state of dangerous heating, with record temperatures, wildfires, floods and droughts. Prof Sir David King, former UK chief scientist,told me: \u201cOf course heating is already at a dangerous level. Greenland is sitting in blue sea for three months losing ice. Temperatures in the polar summer were 32C \u2026 the forests were on fire. \u201cEven if we cut emissions completely we\u2019d still be in a difficult place because of the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere already.\u201d There's a similar message from Prof Piers Forster, coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cPeople are already dying and species are becoming extinct with current temperatures,\" he said. \"We have locked in centuries of sea level rise.  \u201c1.5C has become the talisman for the safest we can hope for this century. But the more we learn the more we realise there is no safe limit [for emissions].\u201d  The scientists we contacted appreciated that COP offered practical solutions.  There\u2019s relief that after 22 previous COPs, there is at last reference to the need to phase down fossil fuels - although there\u2019s dismay that India and China watered down the wording at the last minute. And there are widespread fears that politicians won\u2019t keep their promises. Prof Gail Whiteman, founder of Arctic Basecamp, said the summit had produced \"mixed results\". She said: \"There's a lot of pretty good pledges on the table - but is there going to be enough action? I don't know. I'm worried.\" And Prof Tim Lenton, from Exeter's Global Systems Institute, added: \u201cOn the plus side, the coalition of civil society, business, finance, NGOs and others around COP26 is starting to drive real progress. \u201cBut we are still heading for more than 2\u00b0C of global warming, which risks triggering multiple climate tipping points [when natural systems collapse because of increased temperatures]. We are still in a climate crisis.\" \"We all need to persuade our political leaders to join us in the great transformation,\" he added. \"The international policy process is moving slower than the climate system.\u201d It\u2019s that gap - between policy, action and science - that so alarms climate experts. The UK, for instance, is acknowledged to be a  global leader in policy , setting out domestic targets to achieve near zero emissions by 2050.  But the government has consistently failed to reach its previous climate change targets. While it\u2019s lauded for policies such as phasing out conventional cars, it\u2019s failing on home insulation. It wants to increase flying against the advice of its advisors and it is permitting  an oil field near Shetland . It is  building more roads  and the carbon-heavy HS2.  To the astonishment of the scientists, Chancellor Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t mention climate change in his budget on the eve of COP26. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, continues to insist that carbon cuts can be made by technology alone, with little or no change in behaviour - even though the advisory Climate Change Committee insists that targets for 2030 can\u2019t be hit without a combination of both. There are similar policy tangles in the US. President Joe Biden is struggling to get his green measures through Congress, and his $1tr infrastructure programme for roads, bridges, airports and ports will produce many millions of tonnes of emissions from the concrete and steel used to make them - as well as the traffic that will be generated by them. President Biden may have led the pact to cut methane emissions - but he won\u2019t match Mr Johnson\u2019s pledge on cars. And Americans are still buying huge SUVs. The US climate envoy John Kerry estimates that if nations really apply themselves, temperature rises could be held to 1.8C. The scientists say that's too little, too late.  Prof Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, told me: \u201cWe could still avoid further increases in the impacts of climate change with greater ambition.  \u201cBut until we completely stop building up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we will still continue the heating of the climate and causing evermore severe risks and impacts.\u201d Ed Hawkins,professor of climate science at the University of Reading,warned: \u201cThere is a slope, which we are already sliding down. The sooner we stop sliding - through deep, sustained and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions - the less severe the consequences will be.\u201d An even more profound challenge comes from Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge. He told me the solutions being discussed in Glasgow depend on unrealistic amounts of clean electricity, carbon capture and biomass.  \u201cIf you compare the amount with what\u2019s available today and any plausible growth rate, there\u2019s no possibility we will have enough of those,\u201d he said. \u201cWe therefore need a different sets of policies such as using half the amount of electricity. We must cut levels of flying, shipping, cement and ruminants because there\u2019s no way of dealing with them\u201d. This is an unpalatable message for politicians who want to achieve a stable climate by tweaking Business As Usual.  Follow Roger on Twitter:  @harrabin .

{"id":null,"body":"By Marco Silva Climate change disinformation specialist Several foreign-language Wikipedia pages seen by BBC News are promoting conspiracy theories and making misleading claims about climate change. A number, including some in Swahili, Kazakh and Belarusian, suggest scientists are divided over its causes. The overwhelming scientific consensus is global warming is caused by humans. A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, said they were \"worried\" by the findings and more volunteer editors were needed. The \"climate change\" entry on Chinese Wikipedia lists solar activity as  one of the possible explanations for rising temperatures around the world today . Other widely disproven theories listed include unfounded claims about the  emergence of a totalitarian world government  and tie calls for climate action to secretive financial interests. On Croatian Wikipedia, more than a third of the page on global warming is devoted to questioning the science of climate change, while also pushing conspiratorial views. \"This worries me a lot,\" Wikimedia Foundation senior programme strategist Alex Stinson said. \"And this is why we need more people involved in this project.\" Wikipedia is published in more than 300 different languages, each with its own original content and volunteer editors.  Open for anyone with an internet connection to edit, the quality of its content is entirely dependent on those volunteers. More volunteers in different languages would decrease the chances of conspiracy theories and bad information lingering on the site, Mr Stinson said.  Yumiko Sato, a Japanese writer based in the US who has  investigated misinformation on the platform , said: \"Wikipedia only works if the editing community is large and diverse.\"  Launched in 2001 , the online encyclopaedia is one of the world's most visited websites. The English-language version, the largest, has  more than 40,000 users  actively editing it each month.  Its climate-change pages have  a group of dedicated volunteer editors  who actively patrol for any sign of bad information or pseudoscience. But the same does not apply to many of the pages in languages other than English. In more than 150 languages, fewer than 10 people a month regularly edit any pages. \"[These versions] are much smaller and lack editorial diversity, so that makes them vulnerable to manipulation,\" Ms Sato said. One of Wikipedia's core principles is self-governance. So, unless the community of editors steps in, the Wikimedia Foundation can do little. \"The foundation has never intervened on editorial policies directly and that is not what we do,\" Mr Stinson said.  \"We need to push back on this disinformation in science - but that only works if the science-literate show up in that language, in that context, and that Wikipedia [version].\" Listen to  The Denial Files: 'We fight climate denial on Wikipedia'   on the BBC World Service.

{"id":null,"body":"By Manish Pandey Newsbeat reporter When relationships end it might be because the spark has disappeared, or maybe you just can't make time for one another. But can climate change cause break-ups?  It might do, according to a new study which suggests albatrosses - some of the world's most loyal creatures - are \"divorcing\" more. Research published in the  Royal Society journal  looked at 15,500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years. Albatross divorce is basically just cheating, in human terms. It's when one part of a couple mates with a different individual. Like humans, albatrosses also have an awkward growing-up phase, trying (and sometimes failing) to figure out the best way to get into a relationship. But ultimately, when they find a good match, they normally stick together for life. Just 1% of albatrosses separate after choosing their life partner - much lower than  the human divorce rate  in the UK. \"Monogamy and long-term bonds is very common for them,\" says Francesco Ventura, researcher at the University of Lisbon and co-author of the study. But in the years covered by the study with warmer water temperatures, up to 8% of albatross couples split up. The study says \"environmentally-driven divorce may be an overlooked consequence\" of climate change. Normally, albatross divorce is triggered when a pair fail to breed, so they find new partners in the next breeding season. But the findings showed pairs were divorcing even if they'd had a successful breeding season. Francesco says there are two possible theories for the rise - the first one being linked to the struggles of a long-distance relationship.  Warming waters force the birds to hunt for longer and fly further.  If birds then fail to return in time for a breeding season, their partners may move on with a new partner.  Another theory is albatross stress hormones go up in harsher environments, such as when waters are warmer.  With tougher breeding conditions, and food scarcity, it can cause more stress and a partner can be blamed for their \"poor performance\" - which can ultimately trigger divorce, Francesco says. The research comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble. Some  data from 2017 suggests  the number of breeding pairs of the species are a little more than half of what they were in the 1980s. Francesco says in the Falkland Islands, it's not an immediate concern for the population - but in other areas where the population of albatross is limited, it is a worry. \"Temperatures are going up and will go up, so this might introduce more disruptions,\" he says.

{"id":null,"body":"By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes BBC News, Tokyo It's a glorious autumn afternoon and I'm standing on a hillside looking out over Tokyo Bay. Beside me is Takao Saiki, a usually mild-mannered gentleman in his 70s. But today Saiki-San is angry. \"It's a total joke,\" he says, in perfect English. \"Just ridiculous!\" The cause of his distress is a giant construction site blocking our view across the bay - a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power station in the making. \"I don't understand why we still have to burn coal to generate electricity,\" says Saiki-San's friend, Rikuro Suzuki. \"This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!\" Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate?  So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them. In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive. So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal. Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia.  \"The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,\" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden. \"And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.\" The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution.  But Japan's government has much bigger ambitions than that. It wants to be the world's first \"hydrogen economy\". This is where the carmaker Toyota comes in.    It's another lovely sunny day and I'm in downtown Tokyo, at a shiny new hydrogen filling station. Standing on the forecourt is a sleek new Toyota Mirai. This is a big luxury car, about the size of a large Lexus. I slip into the leather-clad cabin, press the \"start\" button and glide out on to the street. The car is extremely smooth, completely silent, and the only thing dribbling on to the road behind me is a bit of water.  The Mirai (which means future in Japanese) is Toyota's first zero-emissions electric car. Unlike other electric cars, the Mirai doesn't have a huge battery under the floor. Instead, it has a fuel cell under the bonnet, and hydrogen tanks under the back seat. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a fuel cell to form water, with the reaction releasing energy as electricity, which runs the electric motors. It's the same technology that was used to power the Apollo spacecraft on the Moon missions. To many people this technology is an odd choice. It's more expensive and complicated than batteries. Elon Musk has called hydrogen cars \"stupid\". Not true, says Hisashi Nakai, the head of Toyota's public affairs division. He says the company's vision for fuel cells goes much further than just cars. \"I know people have different opinions,\" he tells me, \"but the important thing is realising carbon neutrality. We need to think about how we can make the most out of fuel cell technology. We strongly believe in hydrogen as a powerful and important energy.\" What Nakai-san says shows Toyota is thinking of a future where hydrogen fuel cells are everywhere, in homes and offices and factories, as well as cars. And it wants to be at the forefront of this new hydrogen society. This brings us to the final, and most important question. Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from? The answer is \"blue hydrogen\". Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get \"green hydrogen\". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive. Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it \"blue hydrogen\". This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do. Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan.  What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere.  But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast. Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come. According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic. \"Technically it's possible, but it will always be expensive,\" he says. \"Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.\" Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense. \"Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,\" he says. \"That means they need renewable electricity. Delaying this development will harm the Japanese economy.\" In the meantime, on the edge of Tokyo Bay, construction continues apace. The giant new coal-fired power station will go online in 2023. It is expected to run for at least 40 years. \"I am ashamed of Japan,\" says Hikari Matsumoto, a 21-year-old activist who has joined us to look out from the hillside.  \"I'm so frustrated,\" she says. \"In other countries young people are out on the street protesting, but Japanese people are so quiet. Our generation needs to voice its opinion.\" Countries vow to move away from fossil fuels Why Australia refuses to give up coal Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Jake Horton and Esme Stallard BBC Reality Check Several US states have been hit by a devastating series of tornadoes, with an expected death toll of more than 100. These are extremely rare outside the spring and summer, in the US, but this December there has been a record number of tornado warnings.  So is climate change causing more frequent and stronger tornadoes? When warm moist air is trapped by cooler air, it causes thunder clouds to form. The warm air rises, creating an updraft.  And if there are also strong winds moving in different directions, the air column starts to rotate. Increasing amounts of warm air are drawn in, speeding up the wind spiral, which then extends out of the bottom of the thunder clouds.  And once this touches the ground, it is a tornado.  There is more warm moist air in the hotter months. And a cluster of tornadoes of this size and power in December is extremely unusual in the US. Far more tornadoes have been recorded in the past 20 years than the previous 20 - but some of this is due to improved tracking. As data-collecting methods have improved, less severe tornadoes have been recorded more consistently. \"To an untrained eye, it may look like we are having more of these events happening - but in reality what is happening is we have much better tools for identifying relatively weaker tornadoes,\" Dr Jana Houser, professor of meteorology, at the University of Ohio, says. But clusters of tornadoes - when six or more start within six hours of each other - are becoming more likely. And though there are now fewer days with tornadoes - on average about 100 compared with 150 in the 1970s -  there are more tornadoes on those days. No single weather event can be put down to climate change alone. The increasing amount of tornado clusters \"clearly implies that the patterns of the atmosphere have changed\", meteorologist Harold Brooks, at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), says.  \"That may be related to climate change - but we cannot make a full conclusion,\" he adds. Warmer temperatures make extreme weather events more likely and potentially more destructive. But \"there is no scientific consensus\" on tornadoes, Mr Brooks says. \"It is not like the consensus on the increase in heatwaves or heavy rain at all.\" Wind speed and energy in the atmosphere are two of the main drivers of tornadoes - but there is a lack of definitive evidence on how they may change with a warming climate.   At a briefing following the tornadoes, US President Joe Biden said he would \"be asking the Environmental Protection Agency and others to take a look at [the role of climate change]. \"The fact is that we know everything is more intense when the climate is warming,\" he added. In 2018,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found  some \"conditions conducive to tornadoes such as atmospheric instability [will] increase due to increasing temperature and humidity\".  But other conditions, which may lessen the likelihood of tornadoes, also exist. There is no evidence tornadoes are becoming stronger,  according to National Geographic Society research. In fact, the US had had a \"tornado drought\",  with no highest-category tornado since 2013 .  The most devastating of this weekend's tornadoes has become known as the Quad-State - cutting a swathe through Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky.  It is not the wind speeds, though, that were record-breaking but its size. It was reportedly three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) wide and travelled for more than 220 miles - considerably further than the distance from London to Paris. On average, tornadoes are 50 yards wide and travel only a few miles,  according to the National US Weather Service . The most frequent tornadoes have traditionally been in a strip through the central US known as Tornado Alley. This includes areas of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. But  some evidence points towards a shift  to having more tornadoes in the southern US. Mr Brooks says: \"Tornado Alley is not well defined, so that is hard to say - if there is a definite shift. \"We have seen an increase in tornadoes of about 10% over 40 years in the mid-South region and a decrease in the Texas, Kansas sort of region.  \"It has shifted - but it is not a huge shift.\"  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

{"id":null,"body":"By Marco Silva Climate change disinformation specialist Wikipedia has for so long been plagued by climate change denial. But a group of dedicated volunteers around the world is working tirelessly to keep the deniers at bay. David Tetta lives in northern California, in the kind of close-knit community where neighbours just wander into each other's homes - during our interview, he breaks off for a second to shoo one of them out of the room. It was while chatting to his neighbours that David first thought of volunteering to edit Wikipedia. In 2019, around the time  wildfires were raging across the state , climate change was coming up more and more often as a topic.  \"Many conversations seemed to evolve into people expressing their feelings of angst and fear about the environment,\" he says.  \"I was wondering, what kind of information are people getting?\" David was well-placed to study the subject, having worked for the US Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years.  He looked at the most obvious starting point for climate change information, Wikipedia - and, as he diplomatically puts it, he found \"certain areas of it that could be improved\". He started small by proposing edits and discussing them with other volunteers. But he soon found himself pouring hundreds of hours into Wikipedia editing.  \"You have to read through about 100 pages of scientific information to edit a sentence,\" he says.  English Wikipedia alone gets more than  nine billion page views a month , and the magnitude of that figure is not lost on David. \"It gives you a certain sense of responsibility for making sure you're getting it right.\" The point of Wikipedia is that anyone with an internet connection can edit it. But that also makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and those who deny the climate crisis know it. They've been waging an editing war to get their views across, and subtlety is not always their forte. On one occasion, someone added a sentence wrongly suggesting climate scientists worldwide are in the pocket of a secretive Communist organisation. Another user peppered paragraphs with the word \"alleged\", wrongly suggesting that basic climate science is far less settled than you might think. And, in a rather mischievous twist, one time the entire text of an article on climate change was turned into a hyperlink. Users clicking on any of it would immediately be taken to an article about hoaxes. Those kinds of stunts don't last long, though. \"That might stay up for a few minutes or an hour or so,\" David says. \"But usually, one of the editors will spot it.\" David is part of a small but dedicated  group of volunteers  who have made it their mission to curate and protect articles about climate change on English Wikipedia. And they're not afraid to pick a fight. \"I'll send [the deniers] a note on their personal page on Wikipedia saying, 'This is vandalism, this could have consequences,'\" says David. \"Sometimes these people get kicked off Wikipedia.\" Wikipedia, which was  launched in 2001 , has grown into one of the world's most popular websites, and is published in more than  300 different languages . English Wikipedia is  the largest version  - and, according to the editors interviewed for this piece, the one where you can find the most reliable coverage of climate change. \"We are lucky with a large editor base,\" says Dutch volunteer Femke Nijsse.  She's come to be regarded as one of the most influential voices within the small community of Wikipedia editors specialising in climate change. If you have ever visited the main Wikipedia article on climate change, chances are that you read some of Femke's words - she's the user who's  contributed the most  to that article by far. \"I'm quite proud of my work on Wikipedia,\" she says. Femke is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter, studying the transition to green energy - so global warming is something she's been thinking about for a while. She's been editing Wikipedia articles for seven years and in that time she's got to know what junk science looks like. \"Editors recognise all of the  common climate denial myths , and most editors have a good feeling for misinformation red flags, including use of unreliable sources, of emotive words,\" she says. \"The most satisfying editing for me is the removal of misinformation.\"  Femke is clinical in her debunking of bad science, and a stickler for Wikipedia's rules. In October, a user tried to add a sentence to the climate change article, wrongly suggesting that stopping the world from using fossil fuels would make no difference to global warming. Femke dismissed the edit, but not before explaining that such a statement would have to be backed by reliable sources. Wikipedia doesn't have a policy vetoing climate change denial, but there are policies that insist you have to  cite quality sources , which tends to weed unscientific content out.  \"Wikipedia is just an uncomfortable place to be if you want to promote a point of view that goes against science,\" says volunteer editor Su-Laine Brodsky, a technology writer by profession. \"It's much easier to be on social media, where you can say whatever you want, and not really be held to task for it.\" From her home in Canada, Su-Laine has been editing Wikipedia pages for 15 years.  She started out by sharing medical information and moved on to writing about sea otters and killer whales. She only recently decided to focus on climate pages. \"I've always been interested in the environment and wildlife, and was kind of intimidated by the idea of working on climate change,\" she says. \"I thought of climate change as a very technical and very controversial topic.\" But one day she stumbled across an article on sustainable energy that was riddled with problems. \"It had a lot of self-promotion - companies promoting themselves, people who are doing some kind of research promoting their pet project.\" Su-Laine got stuck in and started getting rid of it.  \"Wikipedians are people who fix things,\" she says. \"You notice something that's wrong, and you just need to have enough confidence to say, 'I can make this suck a bit less.'\" Sometimes the errors are obvious. But it didn't take long for Su-Laine to realise some users were twisting the facts in subtler ways, especially in less-trafficked articles.  \"When you've got an article about a climate science denier, people will try to soften that by saying so-and-so is a 'climate policy analyst'. That's a way of making the person sound more credible,\" she says.  According to Alex Stinson from the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, climate misinformation ranges from neglect - science that's out of date - to a lack of balance, to active disinformation.  He's confident the organisation has what it takes to deal with the problem.  \"All of the studies on vandalism and misinformation suggest that our natural immune system on the big language Wikipedias catches something like 97% of it rapidly,\" he says.  As well as human editors, the organisation also uses computer bots to fight vandalism. High-profile articles, including some about climate, also benefit from additional layers of protection - some of them can only be edited by users with a certain amount of editing experience.  But there will always be areas of the website that are harder to patrol.  \"There are over 6,300,000 articles on English Wikipedia,\" Alex says. \"Not all of those are under the same kind of universal scrutiny of the community.\" And bad information, even outright conspiracies theories, are more common on climate pages in languages other than English,  according to a recent BBC investigation .  For now, it is entirely down to volunteers to hold the fort. \"Wikipedia is uneven,\" says Su-Laine. \"You have to still take it with a grain of salt.\"  Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Is the progress that was made at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit already in jeopardy because of challenges in the year ahead? 2021 was a momentous year for climate change.  As well as a host of extreme, destructive events  influenced by rising temperatures , the past 12 months have seen unprecedented political engagement on the issue, culminating in the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November. Progress was undoubtedly made  and the overall thrust of the meeting was towards more rapid action on a whole host of measures to curb emissions. But there are now growing concerns that this momentum may dissipate over the coming months.  The most grievous blow comes from the US. The  potential failure  of President Biden to get his Build Back Better act through Congress would significantly impact the ability of the US to meet the tough climate targets that the White House has committed to.   It would also hugely affect the relatively unified approach to climate change on display among world leaders at COP26. \"Everything that Biden pledged, led to this relatively good atmosphere and a sense of momentum in Glasgow,\" said Dr Joanna Depledge, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance.  \"But these were just promises, he needs to get the bill through Congress. And it's now looking increasingly dicey. He can do some things with executive orders, but that certainly isn't the kind of sustained institutional climate legislation change that we're really looking for.\"  \"I think the situation to us, is critical.\" The despair among many in the US over the possible failure of President Biden's bill will also have knock-on effects throughout the world. This will certainly be the case in China, a country smarting from the perception that it  flexed its political muscle in Glasgow  to get its way. Biden's political difficulties with the bill are seen as more evidence that the \"West is declining\". \"I am worried 2022 will see a fuller display of geopolitical tension dominating the climate agenda,\" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace East Asia.  He is also concerned that the  mooted introduction of carbon taxes on imported goods into Europe  could elevate a sense of unfairness and frustration in Beijing. \"The Chinese side will see how they are treated vis-a-vis others and make its judgment on whether the game is fair, and most importantly, if it is about the environment at all, or just geopolitics and trade,\" he told BBC News. Overall, I am looking at a more turbulent year ahead. The years before the Paris agreement were an example of geopolitics helping the climate agenda forward. What lies ahead may be the opposite.\" This pessimistic outlook is echoed by the fact that next year's COP is being held in Egypt, and the one after that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  \"Neither of these countries could be described as climate leaders,\" said Prof J Timmons Roberts from Brown University in Rhode Island, US. The good side is that COP27 will be in a developing country, and some issues like loss and damage [who pays for the impact of climate change in the worst affected countries, and how it is paid] may get more traction, but on the issue of emissions reductions, it's not clear that they're going to be leaders.\" Another key concern heading into 2022 is that some countries may simply ignore aspects of the Glasgow climate pact that they don't like.  One key measure in the deal was the request for all countries to \"revisit and strengthen\" their national climate pledges by the time delegates gather in Egypt late in 2022.  Despite agreeing to this, a number of countries now say they simply won't update their plans, among them Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's climate minister James Shaw  told national media  that this provision really only applied to large emitters like India, China, Russia and Brazil which hadn't significantly strengthened their plans in time for Glasgow. However, there are also some positive developments in the offing that could make a significant difference to the general mood around climate change. During COP26, the UK, EU, US, Germany and France  agreed to pay $8.5bn  to help South Africa abandon coal. Now, those close to the negotiations say that two new deals to help India and Indonesia move away from the most carbon-intensive energy source are in the pipeline. These will be expensive, running into the tens of billions, but if they happen, they would represent a massive step away from fossil fuels. These types of arrangements, and the commitment to doubling adaptation finance made by richer countries will be key to progress in 2022, say officials.  Another positive is that the UK's presidency continues right up to next November when Egypt takes over.  COP26 President Alok Sharma has made it clear that he intends to push forward over the coming months in efforts to ensure that the agreements secured in Glasgow on deforestation, coal, finance and cars will start to be implemented.  Mr Sharma's background as an auditor will come in handy in making sure there's no slippage over the integrity of the commitments made.  \"The UK, as hosts of COP26, spent the last two years working tirelessly with countries to build trust, which ultimately allowed us to deliver the Glasgow climate pact,\" he told BBC News. \"We will continue in the same vein through 2022 to make sure countries keep their promises, re-visit their emissions reductions targets, get finance flowing, and deliver on the many commitments made during the two weeks of the summit.\" Another positive is the fact that Germany will chair the G7 group of countries. The co-leader of the German Green party is now the country's foreign minister, so climate will remain high on the international diplomatic agenda.  Infrastructure investment in the wake of the Covid pandemic, especially in middle income countries, also offers a great chance to lock in significant action to limit emissions.  The final agreement on the rules for carbon markets, agreed in Glasgow, has coincided with a record rise in the price of carbon permits in Europe and the UK.  While this has downsides, a sustained high carbon price could significantly speed up a transition to cleaner sources of energy. But, as ever, global events could see all these potential positives quickly pale.  Disputes between Russia and Ukraine, China's disengagement and a drubbing for the Democrats in mid-term elections in the US could all derail or at least delay any further progress on climate change.  And stalling or taking small steps right now would be a disaster for efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. \"Right now, incremental steps are a death sentence,\" said Prof Roberts.  However, the climate negotiations process is highly unpredictable - and even when things appear to be at their darkest, countries are often able to make sufficient compromises to keep things moving forward.  Certainly the COP26 president says he's determined to push ahead and that the UK can be a role model for others. \"Leaving COP26 with the Glasgow climate pact was a historic moment demonstrating the world's shared commitment to taking real climate action,\" said Alok Sharma. \"As we look ahead, the most pressing issue is the timescale on when this action takes place and the reality is that the world needs to act at a much faster pace.\" \"I believe we will reach a net zero world, and the UK is leading the way through our own actions such as rapidly expanding our renewables sector and working to eliminate the use of coal from our electricity generation in 2024, the question is whether that will be fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\"  Follow Matt  on Twitter. .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Climate change will expand the range of tropical cyclones, making millions more people vulnerable to these devastating storms, a new study says. At present, these cyclones - or hurricanes as they are also known - are mainly confined to the tropical regions north and south of the equator. But researchers say that rising temperatures will allow these weather events to form in the mid-latitudes.  This area includes cities such as New York, Beijing, Boston and Tokyo. The  study has been published  in the journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists involved say their work shows by the end of this century, cyclones will likely occur over a wider range than they have for three million years. When subtropical storm Alpha made landfall in Portugal in September 2020, the relatively small scale of damage caused by the cyclone made few headlines. But for scientists this was quite a momentous event. \"We hadn't observed this before,\" said Dr Joshua Studholme, a physicist from Yale University. \"You had a traditional kind of mid-latitude storm, that sort of decayed, and in its decay, the right conditions for a tropical cyclone to form occurred, and that hadn't happened to Portugal before.\" Dr Studholme is the lead author of this new study, which projects that a warming climate will see the formation of more of these types of storms in the mid-latitudes, where most of the world's population lives, and where most economic activity takes place. He explained that as the world gets hotter, the difference in temperature between the equator and polar regions will decline, and this will impact the flow of the jet streams. Normally, these high-altitude rivers of air act as a kind of border guard for hurricanes, keeping them closer to the equator. \"As the climate warms, that sort of jet stream activity that happens in the middle latitude, will weaken and in extreme cases split, allowing this sort of cyclone formation to occur.\" The question of the impact of human induced climate change on hurricanes has been contentious in the past, but recent research suggests that the connections are becoming clearer. Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  published the first part of its sixth assessment report, dealing with the science of a warming climate. In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had \"high confidence\" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened. \"The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,\" the IPCC said. The new research published on Wednesday makes use of multiple strands of evidence to show that tropical cyclones in future are likely to occur over a wider range than previously thought. \"What we've done is make explicit the links between the physics going on within storms themselves and the dynamics of the atmosphere at the planetary scale,\" said Dr Studholme. \"This is a hard problem because this physics isn't well simulated in numerical models run on modern computers.\"  The likely expansion of these storms poses a significant danger to the world, especially when the other impacts of warming come into play. \"Tropical cyclones in the mid-latitude band could experience other changes such as slower motion and heavier rainfall,\" said Dr Gan Zhang, previously an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University and NOAA who wasn't involved in the new paper. \"These tropical cyclone changes, plus pronounced coastal sea level rise might compound potential societal impacts.\" Dr Zhang cautioned that the sensitivity of tropical cyclones to warming has a high level of uncertainty but he said the risk from these storms could still increase even with moderate levels of warming. Certainly, the authors argue that this course is not set in stone and that dramatic reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade particularly, could alter the outcome. \"The control over this is the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles, and that's very tightly linked to overall climate change,\" said Dr Studholme. \"By end of this century, the difference in that gradient between a high emission scenario and a low emission scenario is dramatic. That can be very significant in terms of how these hurricanes play out.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This video can not be played Weather events, linked to a changing climate, brought misery to millions around the world in 2021 according to a new report.  The study, from the charity Christian Aid, identified 10 extreme events that each caused more than $1.5bn of damage.  The biggest financial impacts were from Hurricane Ida which hit the US in August and flooding in Europe in July.  In many poorer regions, floods and storms caused mass displacements of people and severe suffering. Not every extreme weather event is caused by or linked to climate change, although scientists have become bolder in exploring the connections.  One leading researcher, Dr Friederike Otto, tweeted earlier this year that every heatwave happening in the world now is \"made more likely and more intense\" by human induced climate change. In relation to storms and hurricanes, there is growing evidence that climate change is also affecting these events.  In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  published the first part of its sixth assessment report . In relation to hurricanes and tropical cyclones, the authors said they had \"high confidence\" that the evidence of human influence has strengthened.  \"The proportion of intense tropical cyclones, average peak tropical cyclone wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming,\" the study said.  Just a few weeks after that report came out,  Hurricane Ida hit the US .  According to Christian Aid it was the most financially destructive weather event of the year. The slow-moving hurricane saw thousands of residents in Louisiana evacuated out of its path.  That storm brought massive rainfall across a number of states and cities, with New York issuing a flash-flood emergency alert for the first time. Around 95 people died, with the economic losses estimated at $65bn.  The second most financial costly event was the  widespread flooding across Germany, France and other European countries in July . The speed and intensity of the water overwhelmed defences and 240 people lost their lives. Reported damages were around $43bn. In the study, the majority of the weather events in the list occurred in developed countries.  That's because it is more feasible to estimate financial losses from insurance claims and these are usually available in richer countries, where people can afford to insure their homes and businesses.  According to insurance company Aon, 2021 is likely to be the fourth time in five years that global natural catastrophes have cost more than $100bn.  The report also documents many other events where the financial impact is harder to ascertain, but where the impact on people is significant.  Flooding in South Sudan displaced over 800,000 people while 200,000 had to move to escape Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in May.  \"That's a huge human impact,\" said report author Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid. \"Obviously, losing your home, your livelihoods, and everything, and not having the resources to rebuild that is incredibly tough. Whereas at least if you have insurance, you have some mechanism for building that back.\" The report highlights the need for increased efforts on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide to reduce future weather related impacts. It is also calling on global climate diplomats to put their money where their mouth is and help poorer countries that suffer huge economic losses. In the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, this issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate-related events saw major disagreement between countries. Developing nations wanted cash - the richer ones said we need more talks on the question.  \"Although it was good to see the issue of loss and damage become a major issue at COP26, it was bitterly disappointing to leave without a fund set up to actually help people who are suffering permanent losses from climate change,' said Nushrat Chowdhury, Christian Aid's climate justice adviser in Bangladesh. \"Bringing that fund to life needs to be a global priority in 2022.\" The report can be found  here .

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Cracked homes, buckled roads and ruptured pipelines are likely to become common in and near the Arctic as warming temperatures cause frozen ground to thaw, new findings say. Five million people live on Arctic permafrost including in Russia, North America and Scandinavia. Climate change is causing the Arctic to warm two-to-four times faster than the rest of the planet. \"The land changes right before us,\" one Alaska resident told BBC News. Scientists studying the Arctic say that 70% of infrastructure and 30-50% of critical infrastructure is at high risk of damage by 2050, with projected cost of tens of billions of dollars. The study published on Tuesday highlights again how climate change is expected to threaten life as we know it as well as the natural world. \"Arctic communities are all different but everyone living on permafrost is really struggling,\" Kaare Sikuaq Erickson told BBC News. He works in Alaska as a cultural mediator between residents and institutions. Permafrost or tundra is defined as land that has been frozen continuously for more than two years. It covers around one quarter of the northern hemisphere's land surface, including half of Canada's land and 80% of Alaska's.  But warming temperatures are causing parts of it to thaw with often unpredictable effects, including sinkhole formation, land slips and flooding. \"Both the construction itself and the warming of the climate cause permafrost to thaw, which threatens existing infrastructure and future construction projects,\" says lead author Prof Jan Hjort at the University of Oulu in Finland. Imagine living on a block of ice and constantly trying to keep it frozen, Mr Erickson says when explaining the challenges facing Alaskan communities. It affects everything from trying to dig foundations for a house, or building a level road, to installing sewer and water systems.  \"Historically the ice did stay cooler, but now it's warming fast,\" he explains. \"You see the foundations of buildings and highways are up and down - you're driving over big bumps in the roads.\"  Because of the unequal way that the US government divided up land after colonisation in the 19th and 20th centuries, indigenous villages now have limited land and few options to move as it becomes unstable, Mr Erickson explains.  Meanwhile in Russia, up to 80% of buildings are damaged in some cities built on permafrost, the research suggests. Most of the cities in the Arctic are located in Russia and the degrading landscape is affecting food security, traditional lifestyles and accessibility. And as the heating of the planet is projected to accelerate in coming years, more permafrost is expected to thaw, threatening infrastructure and communities. At least 120,000 buildings, 40,000 km of roads and 9,500 km of pipelines, as well as airstrips, are located in permafrost areas of the northern hemisphere, according to the study. \"If you think about the Arctic, the whole landscape stability is dependent on the threshold of zero degrees Celsius. And as ground temperature approaches zero, we are seeing huge waves of problems,\" Arctic geologist Louise Farquharson from the University of Fairbanks, Alaska, told BBC News. In some communities she studies, water mains are rupturing and houses are becoming unstable when the ground subsides. It's become dangerous to play outside in areas due to ponds forming from meltwater. \"It's important to emphasise that people have lived in these landscapes for thousands of years - it's not as simple as saying communities can pick up and move,\" she says. This video can not be played In 2020, evidence of the catastrophic impact of warming permafrost was clear when a huge oil spill caused one of Russia's worst environmental disasters. Around  21,000 tonnes of diesel poured from Norilsk Nickel's storage tanks  into rivers and lakes in Russia's Arctic north. Investigators believe the tanks sank into the ground after it became unstable as permafrost thawed.  It is possible to tackle the problem using different building design or trying to keep the permafrost cool, the research explains. But it is expensive and risky. Some highways in Alaska are already built with what are known as air convection embankments. This method places porous stones inside the surface of roads to encourage heat to rise away from the frozen ground. \"Most scientists would probably agree that the sensible solution is to reduce our dependency on greenhouse gases and thereby lower the degrees to which our planet will warm,\" suggests Dr Poul Christoffersen, glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, UK. \"It's always been hard to live in the Arctic - we always found ways to thrive and we will carry on but it's getting tougher for our people,\" Mr Erickson explains.  Scientists are also closely analysing permafrost to assess how much carbon dioxide locked inside the frozen land is being released as it warms.  The research is published on Tuesday in  Nature Reviews Earth & Environment.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The government has admitted that its efforts to insulate the UK from climate change impacts have been inadequate. The costs of climate change to Britain are \"high and increasing\", it says, and could reach many billions of pounds a year. Ministers say they'll have to go much further and faster to curb the worst impacts. It means climate change must be built into all long-term decisions, such as new housing or infrastructure.  The aim should be to avoid costly remedial actions in the future.   The government has also accepted that it must consider low-probability but high-impact events arising from a heating climate.  The report is a response to an analysis of the UK\u2019s vulnerability to climate change by the official advisers, the Climate Change Committee. \"Climate change is happening now. It is one of the biggest challenges of our generation and has already begun to cause irreversible damage to our planet and way of life,\"  the report begins. It earmarks 61 climate risks cutting across multiple sectors of society.  Health and productivity could be affected, it says, with impacts on many households, businesses and public services. The report warns of worsening soil health and farm productivity, reduced water availability, and impacts on alternative energy supply.  For example, it notes, unless the UK takes further action, the cost of flood-related damages for non-residential properties is expected to increase by 27% by 2050 and 40% by 2080.  That's with a temperature rise of just 2C - and even that relatively low figure is looking very hard to achieve. If temperature rises to 4C \u2013 which the government\u2019s science advisers say is possible - this increases to 44% and 75% respectively.  The government says it\u2019s already investing to adapt to climate change.  It mentions:  But critics say efforts so far have been diluted by inadequate finance from the Treasury for long-term schemes. Indeed the chancellor didn\u2019t mention climate change once in his Budget. Green MP Caroline Lucas MP said: \"It's crystal clear that we are moving nothing like fast enough to net zero emissions and the longer we delay, the more it will cost. The government acknowledges the risks. We have yet to see the action plan that will deal with them.\"  Ministers admit they must do much more.  Climate Adaptation Minister Jo Churchill said: \u201cThe scale and severity of the challenge posed by climate change means we can\u2019t tackle it overnight, and although we\u2019ve made good progress in recent year, there is clearly much more that we need to do.\" Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: \"After more than a decade in power, the Conservatives have failed to build the efficient homes, strengthened flood defences, and resilient natural habitats necessary to tackle the climate crisis. \"Their lack of action and empty promises are putting people, nature, and our economy at risk.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent COP26 President Alok Sharma has warned that progress made during the summit is at risk of \"withering on the vine\". Mr Sharma said that the agreements reached at the Glasgow climate meeting had been a \"fragile win\" for the world. But unless the commitments made are turned into action this year, the chances of keeping global temperatures in check will be lost.  Quoting from the popular film, Don't Look Up, he said this was no time to \"sit tight and assess\". The UN's COP26 climate summit in November ended with a deal being struck in a bid to stave off severe climate change. This pact was the first ever UN climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal - the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. But the pledges didn't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C, seen by scientists as the threshold for dangerous impacts from global warming. Twelve weeks to the day after the start of COP26 (so named because it was the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties), Alok Sharma delivered his first major speech since the gathering, at a Chatham House event in Central London.  Mr Sharma is essentially in charge of the negotiations process until the next major conference, COP27, in Egypt in November.  He highlighted the fact that, despite the pandemic, and frayed international relations, countries had worked together at COP26 to deliver the Glasgow Climate Pact. That agreement, he said, was a significant achievement.  In Glasgow, countries had agreed to return with new and improved carbon-cutting plans for 2030 by the time of the next major summit in Egypt in November. The hope is that every nation will increase their national efforts in line with limiting global warming below 1.5C. Mr Sharma also underlined the progress made in Glasgow on getting rid of the most polluting fossil fuel.  \"When my team and I were deliberating on whether we should aim to consign coal power to history, I was warned we would never get the word 'coal' in a COP text,\" Mr Sharma said.   \"Yet every country at COP has agreed to phase-down coal power.\" But the achievements in Glasgow will not survive if global leaders don't take concrete action this year, he explained. \"Unless we honour the promises made, to turn the commitments in the Glasgow Climate Pact into action, they will wither on the vine,\"Mr Sharma told the audience.  \"We will have mitigated no risks. We will have seized no opportunities. Instead, we will have fractured the trust built between nations. And 1.5C will slip from our grasp. So my absolute focus for the UK presidency year is delivery.\" Mr Sharma outlined four key priorities for this year, the first of which involves getting countries to increase their actions on cutting carbon. He would be concentrating on getting the richer G20 group of nations to do more.  There must also be a renewed focus on helping countries to adapt to climate change, and to make advances on the issue of loss and damage.  Money was critical to progress, he reiterated. Come November, leaders of the richer countries must be able to show that the $100bn (\u00a374bn) promised every year from 2020 would finally be delivered.  At a number of points in his speech, Mr Sharma referred to the  South African deal  put together at COP26.  Countries, including the UK, are stumping up the cash for South Africa to transition away from coal. Mr Sharma indicated that this approach may well be used again. \"Where we can support them, as we're doing with South Africa, in going from coal to a clean energy transition, that's something that developed countries are going to have to do, increasingly.\" Follow Matt  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor Climate change is threatening to destroy treasures buried in the UK as the soils that protect them dry out.  A Roman toilet seat, the world's oldest boxing glove, and the oldest handwritten letter by a woman are some of the extraordinary objects discovered in at-risk British peatlands. It means climate change could undermine our understanding of our past, say archaeologists. About 22,500 archaeological sites in UK may be in danger. The problem is that changing weather patterns are drying out some peatlands - the waterlogged soils that cover about 10% of the UK. Because peat contains very little oxygen, organic materials like wood, leather and textiles do not rot. They can survive for thousands of years, preserved by the stable anoxic chemistry of the soil.  But if the soils dry, oxygen can enter the system, kick-starting the process of decomposition. If that happens artefacts can, quite quickly, rot away. Excavating these potentially huge sites could cost hundreds of millions of pounds and take decades, by which time they may have been badly damaged. The trustees of Magna, a Roman fort alongside Hadrian's Wall, fear the process is already under way at the site. The warnings come as  celebrations for the 1,900th anniversary of the start of construction of the wall  begin this week.   The land at Magna has subsided by up to a metre in places in the past decade. It is evidence of \"desiccation\" - the drying of the peat layer - fears Dr Andrew Birley, the chief archaeologist at the site. It means \"an historical time capsule\" is at risk, he says, because only a tiny part of the site has so far been excavated.  \"This place has the potential to be quite frankly, amazing,\" Dr Birley believes. \"Pretty much everything the Romans used here for 300 or 400 years could have been preserved in more or less the same state it was thrown away, which is an incredible opportunity.\" Another fort a few miles along Hadrian's Wall gives an idea of the astonishing objects that could lie hidden at Magna.  Digs at Vindolanda have uncovered the world's oldest boxing gloves - so well-preserved that you can still see the imprint of the boxer's knuckles on one.  More Roman footwear has been discovered here than at any other site in the world. It is also the source of the oldest handwritten message by a woman found anywhere. In the note, Claudia Severa, the wife of the commanding officer of a nearby fort, invites her friend Lepidina to her birthday party on 11 September about 1,900 years ago. \"Oh how much I want you at my birthday party,\" writes Claudia. \"You'll make the day so much more fun. I do so hope you can make it. Goodbye, sister, my dearest soul.\"   Day-to-day objects like this provide a unique connection to the lives of ordinary people in ancient times. \"This sort of stuff doesn't normally survive, \" says Dr Birley, who works at both sites. \"It can give us amazing insights into what life was really like here on the Northern frontier almost 2,000 years ago.\" He says the priority at Magna now is to try to work out what is happening underground. Boreholes have been dug, and electronic equipment measures the water flow and temperature every hour.  At Teesside University, Dr Gillian Taylor is analysing the chemicals in soil cores from the site to try to understand the processes at work. It would be a \"catastrophe\" for any organic artefacts if the peat dries, she says. \"The risk is they will disappear. We will lose our heritage if we don't look at what's occurring now.\" Fearing the worst, Dr Birley is planning to dig the first test trenches at the site next year. As a small charity, it's the earliest they can start given the cost and labour needed. He says if it looks like the condition of the peat is changing rapidly and the treasures could be lost, a full excavation may be necessary. And changing weather patterns are not just threatening the survival of Roman remains.  Experts estimate that there are about 22,500 archaeological sites  in or beneath peat in the UK. Dr Rosie Everett, of Northumbria University, is part of a team that has been assessing the effect of climate change on peatland archaeology across the UK. She says a host of historic sites in peatlands are under threat, covering the entire sweep of the country's history. There are Palaeolithic pathways up to 12,000 years old, and Bronze Age burial sites as well as the remains of more modern settlements and industrial activities. \"Peatlands represent such a small part of the ecology of Britain, but they have massive potential to tell us about our past,\" says Dr Everett. While an archaeologist working at a \"dry\" site might find 10% of what was once there, at a peatland site they may find as much as 90% of the material culture of ancient communities, say archaeologists. \"The loss of peatlands would have big implications for the understanding of the country's history but also for our climatic history and our environmental history,\" says Dr Everett. That's why she believes there should be greater efforts to protect them. Dr Birley agrees. \"If we lose places like this, we lose that direct connection to the people who lived in this island 2000 years ago,\" he says.  \"We lose the chance to learn as much as we can about them. And we lose part of our own heritage and part of our own history.\" Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The parts of the world suitable for growing coffee, cashews and avocados will change dramatically as the world heats up, according to a new study. Key coffee regions in Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Colombia will all \"drastically decrease\" by around 50% by 2050. Suitable areas for cashews and avocados will increase but most will be far from current sites of production.  The authors say that greater efforts must be made to help farmers adapt. Coffee is one of the world's most important crops, not just as key beverage but as a livelihood for millions of small farmers.  And thanks to growing consumer preferences in richer countries,  demand for avocados  and cashews has increased substantially in recent decades.  While the  threat to coffee from climate change  has been well documented in recent years, there is little information about how rising temperatures will impact avocados and cashews.  In this study, the authors looked at how rising temperatures and changing rates of precipitation will impact the three crops over the next 30 years. The researchers have also, for the first time, incorporated information about land and soil characteristics. Coffee is the most susceptible crop to high temperatures. In those countries accounting for the majority of the world's production of Arabica - the dominant coffee variety - suitability for growing the crop will decrease by around half by 2050 - a \"drastic\" reduction, according to the report. Some key areas will see a heavier impact. In the lowest temperature scenario, there would be a reduction of 76% in Brazil's most suitable areas for coffee. In Colombia it would shrink by 63%. Some regions at the northern and southern ends of today's growing areas will become more suitable, including Argentina, South Africa, China and New Zealand among others.  But according to the authors, this doesn't mean that these new regions can easily replace the current sites.  \"The key message for those that are in the main producing regions today is that farming systems have to adapt to the changing conditions,\" said lead author Roman Gr\u00fcter, from Zurich University of Applied Sciences.  \"If there is already coffee grown in a new area where it is just about possible with some management options, it might get easier or might be possible to expand but it doesn't mean that we will get perfect coffee growing regions within 10 years or so.\" For cashews, the picture is different. Overall, the areas of the world that are highly suitable for growing the crop will increase by 17%.  However, in some of the countries that currently are reliant on cashews as a key cash crop the news is not good. India loses significant areas of suitability, while Benin loses half its suitable areas under the lowest modelled increase in temperature. For avocados, the picture is also complicated - especially in the biggest producing countries.  Mexico, the world's largest producer, sees a major increase in suitable lands, up over 80%. However, Peru - another major grower - loses around half its suitable areas under the same climate model.  While the rise in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns might make some areas more suitable, the authors are concerned that a major shift to develop these crops in new regions might see more forests converted to farmland or a rise of invasive species.  \"In regions that might get more suitable for growing those crops, it is important to make sure that there are no negative environmental impacts such as deforestation,\" said Roman Gr\u00fcter. \"In all of these changes, the local stakeholders, the local communities have to get involved in these changing processes. It should be really participatory.\" A temperature rise of around 1C over the past 30 years has seen farmers in Sicily turn to a range of new crops more suited to warmer conditions.  One of them is Andrea Passanisi, who grows avocados close to Mount Etna. Along with other producers, this change has been very successful for Andrea.  However, as temperatures continue to rise, growing conditions are getting more difficult.  \"The real climate change here is in the seasons,\" he told BBC News.  \"Once it was cold in November and December, now it is January or February - that is not good for avocados.\" Increased levels of drought and intense downpours are also challenging for farmers.  \"If you grow on land that's not suitable for avocado, it's the end,\" Andrea said.  \"We will continue to grow, as we have good land, but we will not have as much fruit.\" While the changing temperatures might seem to be bad news for current growers of these crops, there are some active steps that producers can take that could mitigate climate change.  \"It is possible that some regions where avocados are currently grown the use of the genetic variability of avocado might help,\" said Dr Joaquin Guillermo Ramirez Gil, from the National University of Colombia, who wasn't involved in the new study. \"This species has three 'races' with different geographical origins, which makes it quite 'plastic' to adapt to different climatic conditions. \"There are also local adaptations and new management alternatives such as the use of bio-stimulants and nanotechnology-based products as a basis for reducing stress due to extreme weather conditions.\" The  research has been published  in the journal Plos One.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor A slide show that Prime Minister Boris Johnson says helped convince him on climate change has been revealed for the first time.   The slides used to \"teach\" him about climate science have been released after a Freedom of Information request by UK climate website Carbon Brief. While Mr Johnson has urged action on climate change, he previously, as a journalist, expressed scepticism. He called the presentation, given just after he took office, \"very important\".  The \"teach in\", as it was described in email correspondence, took place in the Cabinet Room of Number 10 Downing Street on 28 January 2020. It was organised by the office of Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser. The briefing consisted of 11 slides showing key aspects of climate science and its impacts and the presentation was led by Prof Stephen Belcher, the chief scientist at the Met Office. The first slide shows the global temperature rise since 1850 alongside graphs showing how carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased and how sea level has risen. Other slides show the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and a comparison of global temperatures against estimates of what they would have been without human influence. There are tables showing the impacts of global warming, including how sea level rise will affect the UK, as well as slides showing how greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut to keep warming in check.  You can see them here .  Prof Belcher described the evidence as \"reasonably vanilla\" in an email, but it seems to have made a big impression on the prime minister.  Mr Johnson spoke to journalists about the briefing as he flew to Rome in late October 2021 for a meeting of world leaders a week before the COP26 UN climate conference. \"I got them to run through it all and, if you look at the almost vertical kink upward in the temperature graph, the anthropogenic climate change, it's very hard to dispute. That was a very important moment for me,\"  Mr Johnson told reporters on the prime ministerial plane . He has also described it as his \"road to Damascus\" on climate - a phrase from the bible meaning a turning point in someone's life. Some climate experts have told the BBC they are surprised the prime minister was not already familiar with much of the material in the briefing.   A version of the temperature graph that made such an impression on Mr Johnson plays a key role in Al Gore's 2006 film and book, An Inconvenient Truth, for example.  \"It is shocking he only had his Damascene moment in 2020 given how much effort scientists have made to communicate the risks of climate change over the years,\" said Emily Shuckburgh, head of Cambridge Net Zero, the university's climate change initiative.  Leo Hickman, the editor of Carbon Brief, was also surprised how long it took for Mr Johnson to have his \"personal epiphany on climate change.\" In his previous career as a journalist and columnist Mr Johnson called into question the evidence that human emissions were the main force driving global warming.  In  a 2013 article  he suggested that year's cold winter should prompt the government \"to start taking seriously the possibility - however remote - that [Piers] Corbyn is right.\" Piers Corbyn is the brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and an outspoken climate sceptic who says the behaviour of the sun, not CO2 concentrations, is the key driver of global temperature. However, there is agreement among scientists that it is a good thing that Mr Johnson has recognised the urgency of tackling the problem and has made it a priority for his administration.

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs Environment correspondent Climate change is causing UK plants to flower almost a month earlier on average, according to a study. Just as autumn leaf fall is being delayed by warmer weather, flowers are appearing earlier on trees and shrubs. But while some might welcome these untimely blooms, scientists are warning of the risks. They say if the trend continues, there are knock-on effects for birds, insects and whole ecosystems. Ecological mismatch may kick in, which would have a dramatic effect \"on the functioning and productivity\" of nature and farming, said lead researcher, Prof Ulf Buntgen of the University of Cambridge. \"Our climate system is changing in a way that affects us and our environment,\" he told BBC News. Global warming is causing spring to arrive early and autumn to come late in many places, and not all plants and animals are adapting at the same rate.  Scientists warn that if species get out of sync with each other, this could have disastrous consequences - a concept known as ecological mismatch. Pollen, nectar, seeds and fruits of plants are important food resources for insects, birds and other wildlife. And if flowers appear too early they can be hit by frost, damaging the harvest of fruit trees. The study looked at hundreds of thousands of observations of the first flowering dates of native trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers recorded in a citizen science database, known as Nature's Calendar, that goes back to the 18th Century. This encompassed the whole of the UK, from Shetland in the north, and Northern Ireland in the west to Suffolk in the east. The Cambridge researchers compared the first flowering dates of 406 plant species with climate records, finding that early flowering is strongly correlated with rising global temperatures. To balance the number of observations, they divided the full dataset into records until 1986, and from 1987 onwards, finding that the average first flowering date from 1987 to 2019 was almost a month earlier than the average first flowering date from 1753 to 1986. Herbs saw the largest shift, flowering 32 days earlier.  Commenting on the research, published in the journal,  Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Dr John David, RHS head of horticultural taxonomy, said plants are flowering earlier as a result of global warming, just as leaf fall in the autumn is being delayed by warmer weather.  He added: \"The main focus of this study is on native plants and so we don't yet have a clear picture of the full impact of these changes on garden plants, but would expect a similar pattern and have seen indications of this in our own RHS gardens such as the apple flowering times in our orchard at RHS Garden Wisley.\" Follow Helen  on Twitter .

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Huge plumes of the warming gas methane have been mapped globally for the first time from oil and gas fields using satellites. Plugging these leaks would be an important step in buying extra time to curb climate change. The new research found plumes covering vast areas, sometimes stretching to 200 miles - the leaks are thought to be mostly unintended. Last year, about 100 countries promised to cut methane emissions by 2030. \"We knew about individual gas blow-outs before, but this work shows the true methane footprint of oil and gas operations around the planet,\" explains Riley Duren, an author of the paper and CEO of  Carbon Mapper  which tracks methane emissions. Methane usually leaks from oil and gas facilities during maintenance operations, while fixing a valve or pipeline, for example, or from compressor stations - facilities that maintain the flow and pressure of natural gas. It is also produced by landfill, agriculture and in coal production. This research focused on detecting oil and gas leaks that can be plugged if companies invest in prevention. Scientists believe that cutting methane emissions is an \"easy win\" in tackling climate change, because it's a very potent gas usually released by humans in leaks that can be stopped relatively easily. An  IPCC study last year  suggested that 30-50% of the current rise in temperatures is down to methane. The lead scientist in the research, Thomas Lauvaux at LSCE CEA-Saclay in France, told BBC News that calculating greenhouse gas emissions usually relies on countries or companies self-reporting. But collecting data from the atmosphere \"offers a more rigorous approach to emissions accounting, more independent and more transparent\", he explains. The three countries with the largest plumes identified in the latest research were Turkmenistan, Russia and the US.  But the satellites did not measure leaks in areas with thick cloud cover or at high altitude, including most of Canada and China. They also only measured plumes from land facilities. The data was collected in 2019-20 by the Tropomi instrument on the EU's Sentinel-5P satellite. It identified the largest of leaks among what are known as ultra-emitters, accounting for about 12% of all methane leaks by oil and gas companies. \"I was shocked but not surprised by the widespread nature of these ultra-emitters. They are the tip of the iceberg,\" professor of geosciences Paul Palmer, at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC News. As more satellites are deployed in the next five years, some will detect methane at much higher resolution, meaning that individual oil and gas facilities can be identified. \"Soon enough, with upcoming sensors, it will be more difficult for the oil and gas industry to claim ignorance about leaks, unintended or otherwise,\" Prof Palmer explains. By plugging these leaks, countries could save billions - including $6bn for Turkmenistan, $4bn for Russia and $1.6bn for the US, the research suggests. In terms of benefits for the environment, the scientists estimate that stopping the leaks would prevent between 0.005C and 0.002C of warming.  That is equivalent to removing all emissions from Australia since 2005 from the atmosphere, or the emissions from 20 million cars for a year, they suggest. \"Capping these very large leaks might seem like it would play only a negligible role, but the societal implications are significant,\" explains Prof Palmer. \"Every molecule counts as we try to minimise future warming.\"  In November, more than 100 governments at the climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow signed up to the Global Methane Pledge. It aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. The ultra-emitter research is published in the research journal  Science .

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Many of the world's biggest companies are failing to meet their own targets on tackling climate change, according to a study of 25 corporations. They also routinely exaggerate or misreport their progress, the New Climate Institute report says. Google, Amazon, Ikea, Apple and Nestle are among those failing to change quickly enough, the study alleges.  Corporations are under pressure to cut their environmental impact as more consumers want green products. Some of the companies told BBC News they disagreed with some of the methods used in the report and said they were committed to taking action to curb climate change. The firms analysed account for 5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the report says - which means although they have a huge carbon footprint, they have enormous potential to lead in the effort to limit climate change. \"The rapid acceleration of corporate climate pledges, combined with the fragmentation of approaches, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated,\" the study says. Study author Thomas Day told BBC News his team originally wanted to discover good practices in the corporate world, but they were \"frankly surprised and disappointed at the overall integrity of the companies' claims\". Amazon said in its statement: \"We set these ambitious targets because we know that climate change is a serious problem, and action is needed now more than ever. As part of our goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.\" And Nestle commented: \"We welcome scrutiny of our actions and commitments on climate change. However, the New Climate Institute's Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report lacks understanding of our approach and contains significant inaccuracies.\" The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor was conducted by non-profit organisations New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch. It looked at firms' publicly stated strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in order to reach net zero. Net zero, a target scientists say the world must reach by 2050 to limit global temperature rises, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount. Companies set their own targets. For example, Google promises to be carbon-free by 2030, while Ikea pledges to be \"climate-positive\" by 2030.  Emissions are created by anything from transporting goods, to energy used in factories or shops. The carbon footprint of growing crops or cutting down trees also counts.  The study gave each firm an \"integrity\" rating. It found that some were doing relatively well in reducing emissions but that all corporations could improve. None was given a rating of \"high integrity\". It assessed factors like annually disclosing emissions; giving a breakdown of emission sources; and disclosing information in an understandable way. It concluded that overall, the strategies in place - if implemented - would reduce emissions by 40% at most, not the 100% implied in the term \"net zero\". Just three of the 25 companies are clearly committed to removing 90% of carbon emissions from their production and supply chains, it says. Those are Maersk, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom. The way that businesses talk about their climate pledges is also a big problem, the study says. There is a large gap between what companies say and the reality, Mr Day says - and consumers are likely to find it difficult to determine the truth. \"Companies' ambitious-sounding headline claims all too often lack real substance,\" he explains. \"Even companies that are doing relatively well exaggerate their actions.\" Mr Day, whose team spent weeks poring over documents, said the average person trying, for example, to choose a piece of furniture, technology or buy food in the supermarket would struggle to make an informed decision. He said one of the most controversial areas was what are known as downstream or upstream emissions - ones that are created by activity indirectly linked to a company.  For example, the report says 70% of Apple's climate footprint is created by upstream emissions, including the consumption of electricity by consumers using Apple phones, laptops and other products. Many companies did not include these emissions in their climate plans.  Ikea told BBC News it welcomed \"dialogue and scrutiny\" of companies' climate commitments and goals, to ensure that they were \"aligned with the science of 1.5\u00b0C\".  \"The new report by New Climate Institute is a constructive addition to this.\"  And Unilever commented: \"While we share different perspectives on some elements of this report, we welcome external analysis of our progress and have begun a productive dialogue with the New Climate Institute to see how we can meaningfully evolve our approach.  Google told BBC News: \"We clearly define the scope of our climate commitments and regularly report on our progress in our annual Environmental Report, where our energy and greenhouse gas emissions data is assured by Ernst & Young.\"  Apple did not respond directly to the report but told BBC News it has a plan to reduce its carbon footprint.  The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor will continue to assess companies' pledges, releasing findings annually. The full list of companies analysed is: Maersk, Apple, Sony, Vodafone, Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, Enel, GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Hitachi, Ikea, Vale, Volkswagen, Walmart, Accenture, BMW Group, Carrefour, CVS Health, Deutsche Post DHL, E.On SE, JBS, Nestle, Novartis, Saint-Gobain, Unilever.

{"id":null,"body":"By Christine Ro Business of Technology reporter Australia's floods of 2010-11 spread devastation and damage across Queensland, with 33 people losing their lives and causing billions in losses across the state. The floods also damaged 19,000km of roads, including those needed for emergency and delivery vehicles. It was a stark lesson in the importance of weather-proofing Queensland's most vulnerable roads, to ensure that future flooding would lead to fewer people being cut off. Since then, Queensland has been using a process called  foamed bitumen stabilisation . This injects small amounts of air and cold water into hot bitumen, the sticky dark substance typically used for road surfaces.  The bitumen then expands and forms a water-resistant layer. The result is a stronger yet flexible road surface or pavement that is better able to withstand flooding.  \"This was actually tried and tested on Queensland's roads during Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017,\" says Caroline Evans, chair of the climate change and road network resilience committee for the World Road Association (PIARC).  \"When the waters receded the pavements were still intact, so they didn't need to be fully rehabilitated afterwards.\"  Foam bitumen stabilisation has also been applied to other roads as part of Queensland's move to makes its roads more flood-resistant, and is proving more cost-effective than traditional asphalt. Queensland faces considerable challenges as it has the longest state-controlled road network of any Australian state or territory with over 33,300km of roads. So far it has built 1,000km of foamed bitumen road surfaces and is \"continuing to develop foamed bitumen techniques\", according to its transport department. This is one of many technologies that authorities are testing on streets around the world. From landslide-blocked roads in Nepal, washed-out coastal highways in the US, collapsed bridges in Kenya to melting ice roads in Canada - an increasingly volatile global climate is threatening to disrupt essential transport networks.  Yet it is also inspiring a great deal of innovation. One of the biggest problems with roads is their vulnerability to high temperatures. Extreme heat can soften pavements, leading to more cracks, buckling and rutting or surface depressions.  The exact effects depend on local conditions, says Refiloe Mokoena, a research engineer at South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). \"There are so many variables that determine a road failure and the road can actually fail in many different ways.\" One solution is heat shields. These are special coatings and tiny hollow ceramic particles that lighten the colour of streets and reflect solar radiation.  \"Some of these heat-shield pavements could reduce the surface temperature by up to 10\u00b0C,\" says Ms Evans. This can also help reduce \"heat island\" effects, she adds, where cities are much warmer than surrounding regions because airflow can be blocked by buildings and there is often a lack of greenery.  Ahead of the 2020 Olympics, Tokyo trialled  solar-blocking paint coating  developed by construction firm Nippon Corporation, a member of the Cool Pavement Society. It says that by the end of 2020, solar heat blocking paint had been applied to nearly three million square metres of the country's road surfaces.  While such coatings might protect the road surface, they could make life more uncomfortable for pedestrians.  Research carried out in the US showed  that reflective road coatings radiated significant amounts of heat upwards. The cost of doing nothing will be steep. If steps to combat rising temperatures and increased rainfall are not taken, then the  bill for repairing and maintaining  roads across Africa could reach $183bn by 2100, according to University of Colorado research. Ms Evans believes that while there is widespread international interest in alternative technologies for roads, the difference between countries is in the level of funding available to invest in the technologies.  One way to keep costs in check would be \"looking at targeted sections of vulnerable roads\" rather than immediately seeking to upgrade an entire road network, she says. This might include increased preventative maintenance in certain areas - which would be cheaper than after-the-fact repairs. Expensive, high-tech materials and processes are not always warranted. Roads with little traffic can be constructed out of low-emission materials like soil, and laid by human workers rather than heavily polluting machinery, Ms Mokoena says.  Low-volume roads also present \"an opportunity to use recycled and waste materials for construction, which would otherwise be destined for landfills; these are typically associated with lower emissions.\"  Alternative materials are particularly important  given the shortage of sand , which is commonly used in road construction.  \"The use of waste and recycled material will likely present a cheaper locally available alternative material to modify bitumen to resist the distresses associated with\u2026 higher temperatures,\" says Georges Mturi,  a senior research scientist at South Africa's CSIR. More technology of business: Recycled tyres have been tested  on a road section in Gauteng, South Africa , where the material showed no cracks from heat. According to Mr Mturi, who was involved in the trial, \"we are continuing with further construction and testing to also demonstrate the various ways of using waste and recycled materials in road construction.\" Other materials could include recycled plastic and glass. It may not seem obvious that such substances might be able to withstand high temperatures and heavy traffic, but \"depending on the form the material comes in, it is something that can be used,\" says Refiloe Mokoena.  Further research may be needed to find alternatives to bitumen and plastic which, after all, are both oil by-products.  In addition there are some \"low-lying fruits\" that can be taken advantage of, says Ms Mokoena. These include regularly maintaining storm water infrastructure and so improving drainage, and planting trees alongside roads to shade pavements. While many potential innovations for improving road resilience are still in the testing and design stage, Ms Mokoena points out that many other technologies exist and have been trialled. What is needed now is the push from industry and governments to make them more widespread.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Scientists say that a rapid drop in emissions because of Covid played a key role in record rainfall in China in 2020.   The decline in greenhouse gases and small particles called aerosols caused atmospheric changes that intensified the downpours.  Hundreds of people died and millions more were evacuated during a summer of record rainfall.  But long-term cuts in emissions are unlikely to trigger similar events.  Many parts of eastern China  experienced severe flooding in June and July  in 2020. The researchers say the reductions in emissions contributed about one third of the extreme summer rain. The Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A number of scientific studies have looked at what caused the flooding events, some  pointing to the extreme conditions  in the Indian Ocean.  Now an international team has put forward a new theory. They argue that the abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. In their study the authors show that over the past four decades summer rainfall over eastern and central China has decreased significantly due to the increase in the number of aerosols in the atmosphere.  These particles, often associated with the burning of coal, can reduce the occurrence of large-scale storms which resulted in lower rainfall.  This new study says that the absence of these particles, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect - a major increase in rain. However, the chain of events that connects the pandemic shutdown to the floods is quite complex. \"There was heating over land due to aerosol reductions but also cooling over the ocean due to a decrease in greenhouse gases, which intensified the land\/sea temperature difference in the summer,\"  explained lead author Prof Yang Yang from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, in China. \"This in turn, increased sea level pressure over the South China\/Philippines sea and intensified the winds bringing moist air to eastern China which then saw intense precipitation.\" Most governments around the world are looking to reduce emissions of warming gases and aerosols through shifting their energy systems away from fossil fuels. Is there a danger that in making this shift they could provoke extreme events like the ones experienced in China in 2020? \"It's a good question,\" said Prof Yang.  \"Because emissions were reduced dramatically in early 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic emerged, it caused an immediate and abrupt change in various components of the climate system.\" \"Such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.\" The new study has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new report on the impacts of climate change will likely be the most worrying assessment yet of how rising temperatures affect every living thing. This will be the  second  of three major reports from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) and its first since November's COP26 summit. Scientists and officials will publish their  conclusions  on 28 February.  The study will focus heavily on regional impacts as well as on cities and coastal communities.  The IPCC carries out these large-scale reviews of the latest research on warming every six or seven years on behalf of governments. This set of three is their sixth assessment report. Researchers are formed into three working groups that look at the basic science, the scale of the impacts and the options for tackling the problem. For many major cities and developing countries, the report will highlight that tackling climate change is not about cutting emissions and hitting net zero sometime in the future, but about dealing with far more short-term threats. \"It is always the immediate, that takes precedence. So if you've got to deal with a big influx of migrants, or a massive flood event, that's where the focus is going to be,\" said Mark Watts, the executive director of the C40 group, a network of around 100 major cities that are collaborating to tackle climate change. \"In the global south, there really aren't any city climate programme funds at the moment. Of those that exist, almost none of them are about adaptation. They're all trying to get poor countries that have relatively low emissions, to reduce their emissions further, not about adapting to the impacts that they're already feeling.\" Under the umbrella of the IPCC, scientists working on the report, who all volunteer for this work, review and write up thousands of papers to summarise the latest findings.  They then meet with government officials to go through their findings line by line and, upon reaching consensus, a short summary of their findings is published.  The study will also outline key \"tipping points\" that are likely to be passed as the world warms - some of which are irreversible like the disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet.  The report will also look at some of the technological solutions to climate change, but is likely to be quite dismissive of efforts to manage solar radiation or even to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Overall it will have a much broader focus than just the science of what we can do about climate change.  Home to more than 24 million, Lagos in Nigeria is Africa's most populated city - but one that's hugely vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise.  Making the situation worse is the problem of rubbish and waste that collects in canals and rivers. Dealing with this issue could be key to helping the city cope with the changes brought about by a changing climate. \"One of the one of the things that needs to change in Lagos to reduce that flooding impact is actually to get a grip of the waste management system,\" said Mark Watts from C40.  \"Supportive investing in the city for them to get really strong municipal waste collection, proper household collection, and getting it properly treated is going to solve two things at once.\" \"The report will talk about social justice more, and it will talk about sustainable development more. It does talk about indigenous and traditional knowledge, not just published Western science,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF.  \"This is about the impacts on people and nature, the risks they face and the limits to adaptation as well.\" But as scientists and officials meet virtually to thrash out the final details, a tussle has emerged over the use of a key phrase in the text.  For years, developing countries have been trying to get the richer world to respond within UN climate negotiation to the issue of \"loss and damage\". They define the phrase to mean the impacts of climate change that countries cannot adapt to, including severe weather such as major storms but also slow-onset events like sea level rise or desertification. Richer countries have long opposed the concept, fearing they could be held legally and financially responsible for centuries for the disruption caused by historic emissions of carbon dioxide. As a result this issue has become a  hugely divisive political issue within global climate talks . In this new report, the IPCC scientists are seeking to use a slightly amended version of the term, talking about \"losses and damages,\" which they say has a different, less political meaning. But officials from several richer governments attending the approval session have objected, fearing that if the idea appears in a key report, it will give backing to those countries who want \"loss and damage\" to be the top priority for international negotiations. Ultimately this report will stress urgency - that if rapid action is taken on cutting greenhouse gases and spending on helping people adapt to climate change is ramped up, then the worst risks can be avoided.  But this hope has to be measured against the reality of politics, according to co-chair Prof Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner. \"One key message has come out of previous reports - political will, in terms of climate action, is the bottleneck for a sustainable future.\" Record high deforestation of Amazon in January Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Many of the impacts of global warming are now simply \"irreversible\" according to the UN's latest assessment. But the authors of a new report say that there is still a brief window of time to avoid the very worst. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that humans and nature are being pushed beyond their abilities to adapt.  Over 40% of the world's population are \"highly vulnerable\" to climate, the sombre study finds.  But there's hope that if the rise in temperatures is kept below 1.5C, it would reduce projected losses. Just four months on from COP26, where world leaders committed themselves to rapid action on climate change, this new UN study shows the scale of their task. \"Our report clearly indicates that places where people live and work may cease to exist, that ecosystems and species that we've all grown up with and that are central to our cultures and inform our languages may disappear,\" said Prof Debra Roberts, co-chair of the IPCC. \"So this is really a key moment. Our report points out very clearly, this is the decade of action, if we are going to turn things around.\" This report from the IPCC is the second of three reviews from the world's foremost body of climate researchers.  Last August,  the first instalment  highlighted the scale of the effect that humans were having on the climate system.  This new report looks at the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. It gives the clearest indication to date of how a warmer world is affecting all the living things on Earth. The report is a stark account of the fierce consequences that the world is already experiencing, like growing numbers of people dying from heat. But the authors say that there is still a brief window of time to avoid the very worst. \"One of the things that I think is really, really clear in the report is that yes, things are bad, but actually, the future depends on us, not the climate,\" said Dr Helen Adams, a lead author on the report from King's College, London. The report shows that extreme weather events linked to climate change like floods and heatwaves are hitting humans and other species much harder than previous assessments indicated. The new study says that these impacts are already going beyond the ability of many people to cope. While everyone is affected, some are being hit much harder. This outcome very much depends on where you live. Between 2010 and 2020, 15 times more people died from floods, droughts and storms in very vulnerable regions including parts of Africa, South Asia and Central and South America, than in other parts of the world. Nature is already seeing dramatic impacts at the current level of warming.  Coral reefs are being bleached and dying from rising temperatures, while many trees are succumbing to drought.  The report highlights the increasing impacts that are expected as the rise in global temperatures, currently around 1.1C, heads to 1.5C. Continued and accelerating sea level rise will increasingly hit coastal settlements pushing them towards \"submergence and loss\". Under all emissions scenarios, the IPCC expects a billion more people to be at risk from coastal specific climate hazards in the next few decades.  If temperatures rise to between 1.7 and 1.8C above the 1850s level, then the report states that half the human population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from heat and humidity. This video can not be played Commenting on the summary, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described it as an \"atlas of human suffering\". He has no doubt as to where the blame lies.  \"The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal. The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.\"  Diseases will likely spread more quickly in the coming decades, say the study's authors.  There is a particular risk that changing climactic conditions will ease the spread of mosquito-borne dengue fever to billions more by the end of this century.  As well as the physical health impacts, this report, for the first time, states that climate change may be exacerbating mental health issues, including stress and trauma related to extreme weather events and the loss of livelihoods and culture. Some researchers have speculated that going over 1.5C for a short period would be acceptable if temperatures came back down below the level soon afterwards.  This report says there are dangers with this approach. \"In any overshoot there's an increasing risk of hitting tipping points and triggering feedback, in the climate system, like permafrost thawing,\" said Linda Schneider from the Heinrich Boll Institute, who was an observer at the IPCC discussions.  \"That would make it a lot more difficult, it could make it impossible to get back below 1.5C.\"  The report is disdainful of technological fixes like deflecting the Sun's rays or removing carbon dioxide from the air, saying they could make things worse.  The summary for policymakers puts much focus on \"climate resilient development,\" which it says helps build the strength to cope with climate change in every society. \"If our development pathways are ones in which health systems don't improve much, education doesn't improve much, our economies aren't growing very fast and inequality remains a big problem, that's a world where a particular amount of climate change is going to have a really big impact,\" said Prof Brian O'Neill, an IPCC coordinating lead author from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the US. \"In contrast, if it's a world where we are really making rapid progress on education and health and poverty, if climate change is imposed on that society, the risk will be much lower.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

From the melting of the Greenland ice sheet to the destruction of coral reefs, climate related impacts are hitting the world at the high end of what modellers once expected. And much more quickly than previously assessed by the IPCC.  Right now, as the new report makes clear, around 40% of the world's population is \"highly vulnerable\" to the impacts of climate change.  But the burden is falling mainly on those who did the least to cause the problem. \"For Africa around 30% of all the maize growing areas will go out of production, for beans it's around 50% on the current emissions trajectory,\" said Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the  Global Center on Adaptation , which assists governments and the private sector in pushing for large scale adaptation solutions.  \"So there are certain parts of the world, particularly in Africa, which will become uninhabitable.\" \"And time is running out, as the IPCC report clearly says, to stop the forces driving this new climate apartheid,\" he told BBC News.  For several years, developing countries have been trying to get richer nations to take the idea of loss and damage seriously.  It's defined as those impacts of climate change that can't be adapted to, or slow onset events like sea level rise.  It has been very controversial because it is bound up with the long-term historical responsibility for carbon emissions - and richer nations fear being dragged through the courts and forced to pay indefinitely for current and future losses and damages that they have contributed to. At COP26 in Glasgow,  political progress on the issue stalled  when the US and EU blocked a dedicated funding facility for loss and damage.  Now the IPCC clearly states that the observed impacts of climate change include \"widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.\"  The endorsement by the IPCC is likely to give loss and damage a major boost in climate talks, a fact recognised by the UK's COP President, Alok Sharma, who is in charge of UN negotiations until COP27 begins in Egypt later this year.  \"Today's report underscores the urgency with which we must prepare for climate change and address a new reality of loss and damage, especially in the world's most climate-vulnerable communities,\" he said. \"The next decade is crucial.\" According to the IPCC, the use of some technologies designed to limit warming or reduce CO2 could make matters worse rather than better.  There are also worries that  machines that suck CO2 from the air  could simply trigger the release of more warming gas. \"If you remove CO2 from the atmosphere, you'll get a rebound effect from the others in the carbon cycle,\" said Linda Schneider from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, who was an observer at the IPCC discussions.  \"The oceans, the land reservoirs, will have an outgassing effect. And so some of the CO2 that that you removed from the atmosphere will be returned to the atmosphere.\" While large cities are hotspots for climate impacts, they also offer a real opportunity to avoid the worst impacts of warming.  As cities continue to grow they can push for renewable energy, greener transport, and buildings. This could limit destructive climate impacts for millions.  \"We point very clearly to the cities of the world as a key place for mobilisation,\" said IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts. \"This is where some of our most vulnerable people are located in coastal cities so that's already an entry point, you can change your options by beginning to mobilise around coastal urban development.\" While this is a bleak assessment of the impacts now and in the future, the authors remain convinced that the worst impacts can be averted - if we act in time.  The IPCC says this opportunity for action will only last for the rest of this decade, as the final sentence in the new report underlines.  \"Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.\" If the world can cut emissions drastically and significantly boost spending on adaptation, that could avoid locking in certain disaster.  And it's not just about spending on green energy and electric cars. The authors say that investing in education, health systems and social justice could help people to cope with the impacts of rising temperatures. Investing in nature will also be a bulwark against the worst, says the IPCC, which calls for 30-50% of the world to be conserved.  \"Nature can be our saviour,\" said Inger Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Programme.  \"But only if we save it first.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathBBC .

{"id":null,"body":"By Victoria Gill Science correspondent, BBC News A leading Ukrainian scientist says war is \"closing the window of opportunity\" for the world to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.  Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who is a member of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ), spoke to me on Zoom from her apartment in Kyiv. \"It's amazing how the people of Ukraine united against one enemy,\" she said.  \"If we all unite against climate change, we can survive as a civilisation.\" Dr Krakovska was taking part in the final stages of approving  the IPPC's latest major assessment on the impacts of climate change  when the invasion made it impossible for her to continue her work.  \"Everything stopped,\" she said. \"I can't think about climate change, because I can't think about anything other than to try to survive.\" But, describing herself as part of the country's \"sofa army\" she said she was doing what she could from her home, where she and her family are sheltering, to speak out about the situation in Ukraine.  She stressed that fossil fuels, and Europe's reliance on exported oil and gas from Russia, were \"funding the war\".  \"The money that's invested in fossil fuels, they're using against us,\" she said. \"Against freedom. Against humanity.\" Europe's reliance on Russia for energy was cited by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in  a speech on Tuesday , in which she urged a faster transition to renewable energy, saying: \"We simply cannot rely so much on a supplier that explicitly threatens us.\" Dr Krakovska pointed out that scientists had been laying out the evidence for a need to make that transition for decades. \"To me it's obvious,\" she said. \"If we want to survive, we have to do this.\" But she pointed out that the window of opportunity to slash emissions - by, in part, switching to those low carbon and renewable energy sources - is closing very rapidly.  \"This war,\" she added, \"it makes this window of opportunity even more narrow, because now we have to solve this problem first.\" The veteran climate scientist has travelled the world in her research to understand the impacts of rising global temperatures. In 2021, she received an award from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for her participation in an Antarctic expedition.  In recent weeks, as Russian troops gathered on the Ukrainian border and as war finally, and suddenly, came to Ukraine, she told me that she had received many calls from colleagues around the world, offering her research posts in their institutions.  \"I just can't do it,\" she said, choking back tears. \"This is my motherland.\" Follow Victoria  on Twitter Five things new IPCC climate change study tells us Radiation spike at Chernobyl site seized by Russia Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent As countries scramble to reduce their reliance on Russia's oil and gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, few places are as exposed as the European Union. The EU gets roughly 40% of its gas from Russia: According to  figures  from research group Transport & Environment, this dependence costs around $118m a day. But moving with a speed few thought possible, the EU has now laid out a strategy that could cut reliance on this fuel source by two thirds within a year. The  REPowerEU  plan aims to make Europe independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030, but the initial efforts focus solely on gas. The roadmap essentially proposes finding alternative supplies of gas in the next few months and boosting energy efficiency while doubling down on greener sources of power in the medium to longer term.  \"It's hard, bloody hard,\" said EU Commission vice president Frans Timmermans. \"But it's possible if we're willing to go further and faster than we've done before.\" The Commission's new proposals will make it a legal requirement for EU countries to ensure they have a minimum level of gas storage.  The aim is to have gas stocks at 90% of capacity by the Autumn, up from around 30% now.  Discussions are ongoing with existing gas suppliers including Norway, Algeria and Azerbaijan to boost flows.  The plan envisages ending reliance on all Russian fossil fuels \"well before\" 2030. In the short term, gas should be sourced from the US and Africa while some countries may need to use more coal in the months ahead. The EU also proposes a massive ramping up of renewables, biogas and hydrogen. While carbon emissions may rise in the short term, the longer-term aim is a speedier transition to sustainable sources. Another key focus in the coming months will be increased imports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from suppliers including the US, Qatar and Australia. But with Germany announcing plans for two new LNG terminals to increase supplies, some experts are worried that this could increase longer term dependency on fossil fuels. \"I think we're living in a tricky time, that there's so much political pressure to make these energy policy decisions,\" said Prof Paula Kivimaa from the Finnish Environment Institute and the University of Sussex. \"But we also must look beyond the next couple of years. If Germany builds new LNG infrastructure, there is a risk that it kind of locks it in for the foreseeable future.\" As well as diversifying gas supplies, the Commission also believes the reliance on Russia will be eased as there are new renewable energy projects due to come online.  The EU says that countries should look to use the revenues raised from the  Emissions Trading Scheme , which have almost doubled since 2020, to pay for these green energy sources. But in the next few months, dirtier energy sources like coal may also be needed.  \"There is some capacity from the power sector to generate more electricity with coal, and biofuels and there's also some new wind and solar products coming online,\" said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of gas and power markets research at analysts, Rystad Energy. \"So this could be a way of reducing some of the gas consumption as the power sector is the largest consumer of gas. This could be done within this year.\" Frans Timmermans recognised that for some countries, it might make sense to switch to coal in the short term, but this could bring its own difficulties. Europe gets around 30% of its coal from Russia. Alternative supplies from countries like South Africa and Columbia are not easily obtained.  Any switch to coal would also rapidly boost carbon emissions, a trend that's already well underway.  \"We've already seen the emissions from coal increase last year, because of an increase of 18% in coal power generation,\" said Carlos Torres Diaz. \"So if this continues, during 2022, emissions will continue to rise, because coal power generation has more or less twice as much emissions as gas generation.\"   The Commission document also says that renewable energy projects must be fast tracked and says there is huge potential in domestic rooftop solar power.  Up to a quarter of the bloc's electricity consumption could be generated from panels on homes, farms and commercial building, the Commission says.  To reduce reliance on natural gas from whatever source, the Commission is also calling for a huge ramp up in biogas, which is made from agricultural and food waste. With the extra investment in renewables, this could also lead to a significant increase in green hydrogen which can be made from wind and solar power.  The Commission is now calling for a quadrupling of hydrogen use by 2030. \"They would have gravitated towards green hydrogen over the next couple of decades, up to 2050, that sort of timescale,\" said Mike Foster, Chief Executive of the UK trade body Energy and Utilities Alliance. \"Actually, this crisis has brought it to a head, and you're probably going to get decisions made in the 2020s to bring it all forward at least 10 years.\" There may well be some dissenting voices when EU leaders meet in Versailles later this week. They will all recognise that all these proposed changes will not come cheap.  Campaigners say that Europe's governments must ensure the very poorest are protected. \"In parallel with introducing sanctions a huge package of support must be deployed to ensure that they do not deepen Europe's ongoing energy poverty crisis and that no one has to choose between heating and eating,\" said Mike Davis from Global Witness, who are calling for a full oil and gas embargo on Russia. \"The need for everyone to be able to afford to heat their home must come before worries about economic growth.\" The Commission will be encouraging countries to use a toolbox of measures to protect consumers, including windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies. But while the poorest may receive some protection, in the short term there will be added pain on the price front.  \"I don't see a simple way for to shield the consumers from the costs that all of this transition will imply,\" said Carlos Torres Diaz from Rystad.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Can the government wean Britain off Russian gas while also keeping energy affordable and hitting its climate change targets? Boris Johnson has pledged to produce an energy strategy shortly that does all three things.  Can he pull it off and what are the political hurdles he faces? Some journalists have been briefed that the PM may encourage further research into  fracking  - where rocks are cracked underground to release gas. But otherwise the launch will offer no radically new policy - rather, an acceleration of existing plans.  One thing is clear - there will be no new coal-fired power stations. But Mr Johnson is being tugged in two directions as he deliberates.  The business department (BEIS), and most experts, tell him existing plans to cut fossil fuels to protect the climate will help shield the UK from rocketing global prices for oil and gas.   They want government support for home insulation to reduce demand for gas heating. They say alternatives, such as electric heat pumps, should be rapidly deployed. And they want much faster deployment of renewables and nuclear.  Conservative commentators share the desire for new nuclear, but insist that the UK should also resume fracking to shield the UK from fuel price rises. The PM is looking to announce plans from the short term to the long term.  Instant cheap - or even free - results, for instance, can be gained by cutting our use of gas and oil.   The  International Energy Agency  urges everyone to turn down the thermostat by a degree - that could save up to 10% of heating energy (and costs), it says. Insulation is another no-brainer quick hit - and it makes your home more comfortable. Even a draught excluder \"sausage\" for a door makes a small difference, as does basic draught-proofing. Heating only the rooms you're using is an easy hit. A speed limit of 55mph - the most efficient running speed for many cars - could be set during the energy crisis to cut carbon emissions. That might be resisted by a libertarian PM and in any case the RAC Foundation said it would be more effective to make fewer trips, and to brake and accelerate more smoothly. Trains could reduce their top speed and services could be reduced to prevent empty running.  The public might accept the restrictions if they were persuaded of an urgent need.  Some analysts want the government to phase out the sale of new gas boilers and hobs rapidly. Boilers running on imported gas would be replaced by electric heat pumps powered by electricity generated by British wind farms. That would immediately cut demand but it would require a challenging increase in heat pump installations when there are too few installers and a poor supply chain.  Others want a government energy savings campaign like the one employed to tackle the oil crisis in 1970s with cheeky slogans like \"Save energy - bath with a friend\".  What about the medium term?   This is where the fracking debate comes into play. When fracking began in the UK there were high hopes Britain could emulate the cheap energy boom in the United States.  But there were problems. The operators couldn't predict the effects of the fracking process, and neighbours complained about minor earth tremors and house prices.  What's more, geologists started to raise doubts - not about the quantity of shale gas in the UK, but about our potential ability to get it out of the ground. Then economists warned that any fracked gas would be sold on to the global market so it wouldn't lower UK prices much anyway.  Former head of the gas giant Centrica, Iain Conn - previously a shale fan - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think it is possible to drill enough wells to be able to make a material difference to the UK supplies.\" In 2019 the government put a moratorium on fracking, which a No10 statement said would last until firms could ensure shale gas can be obtained without significant tremors. That's the official line - but a Downing Street spokesman said nothing had been ruled out. The PM could, hypothetically, announce an inquiry which might or might not find in favour of fracking - but would at least relieve political pressure from some of his backbenchers. Wind energy also lies in the medium term. Onshore wind power is cheap and consistently polls show it's liked by the general public. That hasn't stopped some newspapers labelling them \"hated\" wind farms. The government previously responded to pressure from local objectors and imposed rules which effectively allow just one protester to kill a project.  Operators say they need these rules changed. Offshore wind farms take up to 20 years to develop at the moment. But the operators say new turbines could be spinning within just two years if the government gives more resources to the cash-strapped authorities that grant consent. Then offshore oil and gas operations are a medium to long-term bet. They take an average of 28 years to start production, but these too, could be fast-tracked.  There's no fossil fuel bonanza left in the North Sea. Many stocks are exhausted, and all produce will be sold at world prices anyway. But ministers decided before Vladimir Putin's war that it was better to get UK gas with UK jobs and taxes than foreign gas liquified, with more impact on the environment. This was controversial: the International Energy Agency wants to halt all new fossil fuel operations because enough has been found already to wreck the climate.   The same MPs who are demanding fracking also support new nuclear power stations - but these would be expected to take decades to build, and the current incident at the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine won't make the consenting process any easier.   Some environmentalists also support nuclear power to cover for renewables when the wind isn't blowing. But the government hasn't embraced it until recently because of public fears, the absence of waste storage and - importantly - the cost. Nuclear comes in at around \u00a390 per megawatt hour, while new offshore wind is around half that.  But after decades of dither from Tories and Labour, the wind is clearly blowing nuclear's way. And Mr Johnson will offer a  renewed push for Sizewell C and a boost for mini-reactors . Nuclear enthusiasts say the UK needs a whole raft of new nukes to play a significant part in the energy mix.  It is potentially a critical moment in the UK's energy history.  The government has been criticised for failing to live up to its promises on climate change, but Mr Putin's missiles may have turbo-charged plans to improve achieving energy security while cutting emissions. Labour has seized the moment by demanding what it calls an energy sprint - ramping up renewables and nuclear. It says insulating 19 million homes over a decade would cut UK gas imports by 15% and save up to \u00a3400 off the average energy bill.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak has so far declined to commit to a major long-term home renovation and energy efficiency strategy that could keep down bills. Labour believes progress has been delayed because the government feels the breath of climate sceptics over its shoulder.   The Lib Dems and Greens have long demanded tougher action towards energy-saving and low-carbon domestic electricity.  So fracking may grab the headlines in the PM's forthcoming speech.  But the real test will be whether at last the government is willing to invest the cash and the policies to deliver its climate targets, hold down bills and protect us from Mr Putin's war.

{"id":null,"body":"The Australian government has won an appeal against a ruling that it has a duty of care to protect children from harm caused by climate change. Last year, eight teenagers and an 87-year-old nun convinced a court that the government had a legal duty to children when assessing fossil fuel projects. The decision was hailed as a world first, but it has been successfully challenged by the environment minister. The teenagers could still take the case to Australia's highest court. \"Today's ruling leaves us devastated, but it will not deter us in our flight for climate justice,\" said 17-year-old Anjali Sharma, in a statement released by their lawyers. Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. Three judges in the Federal Court of Australia unanimously sided with Environment Minister Sussan Ley on Tuesday,  but their list of reasons  differed. Chief Justice James Allsop said he thought elected officials should decide policy matters, but noted there was \"no dispute\" in the case that climate change itself caused harm. Justice Michael Wheelahan said there was an \"incoherence\" between the law and the minister's obligations to rule that she had a duty of care. Justice Jonathan Beach said there was not \"sufficient closeness or directness\" between the minister's decision and \"any reasonably foreseeable\" harm from the mine. Ms Ley did not immediately comment on the decision. Another student involved in the case, 15-year-old Izzy Raj-Seppings, said: \"Our lawyers will be reviewing the judgement and we may have more to say in the coming weeks.\" \"While today's judgement did not go our way, there is still much to celebrate. The court accepted that young people will bear the brunt of the impacts of the climate crisis.\" Catholic nun Brigid Arthur acted as the teenager's legal guardian in the case. Last year,  she told the BBC that they had \"every right to be calling people to account\" . A report published at the COP26 global climate summit last year ranked Australia last among 60 countries for policy responses to the climate crisis. The country is the world's second-largest coal exporter and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said the industry will operate there for \"decades to come\". Australia has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but it has faced criticism over its 2030 targets.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The dense plumes of wildfire smoke seen in recent years are contributing to the warming of the Arctic, say scientists.  Their study says that particles of \"brown carbon\"  in the smoke are drifting north and attracting heat to the polar region.  The authors believe the growing number of wildfires helps explain why the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet.  They're concerned that this effect will likely increase. Over the past decade, smoke from raging wildfires in Australia, Portugal, Siberia and the US have changed the colour of the skies. The smoke has impacted human health, and the amount of carbon released by the burning has helped push emissions to record levels. But now scientists say that all this burning has contributed to another serious issue - the loss of sea ice in the Arctic. Researchers have long been familiar with \" black carbon \", the sooty particles that are emitted from diesel engines, coal burning, cooking stoves and other sources.  These aerosols, which absorb sunlight and turn it into heat, are known to be the  second largest contributor to global warming .  The impact of these particles on the Arctic and on clouds has been well documented.  However, the same can't be said for brown carbon - which principally comes from the burning of trees and vegetation but is also created, to a lesser degree, from fossil fuels. The warming effect of this less dense substance has been either ignored or estimated with huge uncertainty in climate models.  To develop a better understanding of the impacts, researchers travelled around the Arctic ocean on the Chinese icebreaker, Xue Long, in 2017. While some previous estimates had shown brown carbon was responsible for just 3% of the warming effect compared to black carbon, the scientists found that it is doing far more damage in the region.  \"To our surprise, observational analyses and numerical simulations show that the warming effect of brown carbon aerosols over the Arctic is up to about 30% of that of black carbon,\" says senior author Pingqing Fu, an atmospheric chemist at Tianjin University in China. The study found that wildfires were the main source of this brown material - contributing twice as much to the warming effect of brown carbon in the Arctic than was coming from fossil fuels. The authors believe that while black soot has played the major role, brown carbon had a hand in the exceptional warming being felt in the Arctic region in recent decades.  Over the last 50 years, the icy north has been warming at three times the rate of the rest of the planet.  The main factor driving this difference is what's termed Arctic amplification.  What happens is that the ice and snow on the surface of the Arctic waters normally reflects most sunlight back to space, but as the ice melts the darker waters absorb much more heat, which in turn melts the ice even quicker.  But as wildfires in mid and northern latitudes have increased as the world warms, this new study finds that brown carbon from this source is having an increasing impact in the Arctic. This is what scientists describe as a feedback loop, where the warmer world causes more fires, which in turn leads to less ice and more heat.  \"The increase in brown carbon aerosols will lead to global or regional warming, which increases the probability and frequency of wildfires,\" says Dr Fu, explaining the way the feedback loop works. \"Increased wildfire events will emit more brown carbon aerosols, further heating the earth, thus making wildfires more frequent.\" As a recent UN study has shown,  wildfires are likely to increase by up to 50% by the middle of this century , so the authors believe this brown carbon trend will likely increase. The scientists involved in the study say that their work shows that the importance of managing vegetation fires is not just about saving lives and limiting the damage done by burning - it also has a role in limiting the warming of the planet.  The study has been  published  in the journal, One Earth. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Steffan Messenger BBC Wales Environment Correspondent This video can not be played Appropriately enough, it's drizzling on the day we visit the town billed as Wales' wettest. A grey sky blends in with the towering slate mounds which surround Blaenau Ffestiniog, whose quarries once \"roofed the world\" and helped it earn  Unesco World Heritage status . Situated among mountains in the heart of Snowdonia, the area's reputation as one of the wettest places in the UK is also considered a badge of honour. Residents even hosted a  Festival of Rain  for a few years. They are now being asked to work together to decide on ways of adapting to the challenges posed by climate change. In the largest project of its kind so far in Wales, five climate assemblies are being set up across Gwynedd in north-west Wales to involve local communities in the push towards a greener future. One of the first to sign up during a door-knocking recruitment drive was Amy Karamian, holding her young daughter Anri. She runs a vegetable box delivery scheme and said climate change was a pressing concern for someone working with farmers. \"It's just constant seasonal updates from growers who are being affected by storms, drought, rain - a kind of constant cascade affecting the crops,\" Amy said on her doorstep. She feels it is important for the community to look at providing more growing space and teach people the skills to cultivate their own fruit and vegetables in case access to food becomes \"more and more limited\" long term. As Amy talked, builders were at work on a house nearby which had its roof blown off by  Storm Eunice , one of three to hit the UK in quick succession in February. The impact of wetter, wilder weather on the town's ageing, stone-built housing stock is something that worries community councillor Rory Francis. \"We have (among) the highest rainfall levels of any town in Wales and England so it's difficult to keep houses both warm and dry,\" he said, with damp and poor insulation particular problems. But Rory said it is worth remembering how fortunate residents are to have such a beautiful local environment - \"during lockdowns I could be out walking in the countryside, through tree-clad gorges every day - while my son was stuck in a tiny flat (in the city)\". He said the town council had recently declared a climate and nature emergency, and had \"high hopes\" the new climate assembly would help them develop environmental policies. Luke Mason joined a number of young people to sign up as organisers recruited people along the high street as the 19 year old said it is \"worrying how much change is happening to our planet - it's on a massive scale\". He would like to see better public transport to encourage people out of their cars because his hometown \"is a bit isolated if you don't drive\". Sophie Lewis was another 19 year old to sign up as she would like to see more parks created and activities for teenagers. The apprentice chef also hoped there would be a focus on helping people with the cost of living - \"electricity and gas are going really high, it's getting hard to pay my rent\". It was a point we heard repeatedly outside the offices of Cwmni Cymunedol Bro Ffestiniog, which brings together a number of social enterprises. \"We call it a parasol, rather than an umbrella, organisation, because it's always so sunny here,\" joked development officer Ceri Cunnington. One of the projects offers a drop in service for people needing advice with issues such as saving energy and finding work. Ceri said he's just been talking to somebody in tears as their monthly gas bill is set to rise from around \u00a360 to over \u00a3200 in April. \"How are people meant to live like that?\" he asked. He sees the climate assembly idea as a way of trying to bring about social justice in a place which suffers from some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in Wales and yet has huge potential for generating green energy. \"Water comes flowing down the mountains and hydro power plants in this area create 133% of our electricity needs,\" he claimed. \"All of that resource is being sucked away. It's a scandal. But coming together with a collective voice we can get to grips with some of these issues.\" Traditionally, climate assemblies have tended to result in a report or recommendations for politicians or the government but organisers want to focus on actions the community could take themselves. That could involve coming up with ideas and then applying for grant funding to carry them out.  \"The assemblies are for everybody, you don't need to know anything about climate change, you can have any sorts of opinions and ideas,\" explained Nina Bentley of Gwyrddni, the lottery-funded organisation set up to run the project across Gwynedd. There has already been a UK assembly, as well as for Scotland and at local levels elsewhere in Wales. One leading academic who has been involved in evaluating the work of other climate assemblies said they were \"still an ongoing experiment in how to involve people in decision making\" around climate change. But Dr Stuart Capstick, deputy director of the centre for climate change and social transformations at Cardiff University, said that participants tended to feel \"positive about them and quite galvanised afterwards\". \"They go from being a bit curious through to becoming informed and quite active and outspoken as a result,\" he said. \"We know from our own research that the public is broadly speaking very concerned about climate change but often at a bit of a loss about where they fit in. \"Often it is presented as either this huge, vast complex international issue or it gets reduced to individual actions. \"So the value of these types of processes is they help to bridge that gap and give some context at a local level as to the type of policy measures or local actions that can be taken.\" Back in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Ceri Cunnington is aware of the dangers this could descend into a talking shop. \"It's when you get higher up it's a talking shop,\" he said with a wry smile. \"Wales is brilliant at writing strategies, probably the best in the world. But acting on them is something completely different, and that's where community comes in. \"Community does respond, does work together and can come up with solutions, and we found that out during Covid.\" This video can not be played As well as the Blaenau Ffestiniog area assembly, others are being set up for Pen Ll\u0177n, Dyffryn Ogwen, Dyffryn Nantlle and Dyffryn Peris over the next two years.  Residents have until 4 April to sign up either in person or online before a representative panel of 50 people will be selected to take part in each area.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent UN scientists are likely to weigh up technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as they gather to finalise a key report. This idea will be one of many solutions considered over the next two weeks by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Also in attendance will be government officials from all over the world, who will need to approve every line in the summary report. It is due to be published on 4 April. This new study will be the third of three important reports from the IPCC issued over the past eight months. The previous two have looked at the causes and impacts of climate change, but this one will focus on mitigation - or what we can do to stop it. This essentially means that researchers will look at how we can reduce the amount of warming gases that are emitted from human activities. However, the IPCC co-chair says this mitigation report will look more closely at ways of removing CO2 that's already in the atmosphere.  \"We have a lot more material, this time on carbon dioxide removal. That is, not putting carbon into the atmosphere, but getting it out again,\" said Prof Jim Skea, from Imperial College, London. \"The report was scoped out to cover the full spectrum of carbon dioxide removal approaches, which vary absolutely hugely, and the carbon dioxide that is removed can end up in very different stores and in very different places. So it was within the scope of the report to cover the whole lot, basically.\" The kind of carbon removal approaches the report will consider will likely include tree planting and agriculture, as well as the more advanced technological approaches that use  large machines to remove the carbon from the air .   They will also look at combined approaches, where land is used to grow crops which can be burned for energy while the carbon is captured and buried.  The use of these types of technology is controversial. Campaigners express doubts that they can be made to work economically and there are also concerns that technology could be seen as an excuse not to make the major changes in energy production that are needed.  Scientists though say that the situation is now so serious that carbon dioxide removal will be needed in addition to massive cuts in emissions and not as a substitute for them. What ultimately emerges in the short summary for policymakers that will be published in two weeks, will depend on delicate negotiations with government representatives from 195 countries.  Researchers and officials will work through the summary line by line to agree the final text. There are some concerns that the war in Ukraine might have an impact on the meeting, with representatives from both Russia and Ukraine due to take part.   \"We have been running some informal meetings with governments to brief them ahead of the actual approval session,\" said Prof Skea. \"I would be optimistic that we would get full participation.\" The new report, part of a regular review of the science dating back to 1990, will also have a new focus on the social aspects of cutting carbon. \"This chapter looks at the social science perspective of demand, and what motivates individual consumers, communities, businesses, to make responsible consumption, reduction, design and investment choices,\" said Dr Joyashree Roy, from Jadavpur University and the lead author of this part of the report.  \"Responsible production and consumption are also within the scope of this chapter, and we have also been asked to look into what are the drivers of behaviour change.\" There will be much focus on short term actions that governments can take in the remaining years of this decade to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.   This was  assessed in 2018  as needing emissions to be cut in half by 2030 - but after the pandemic and with the likely ramping up of fossil fuel use in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, the scale of emissions cuts may need revising upwards. Despite this, the report will likely emphasise that there is hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided, if urgent action is taken. Prof Skea says the summary will not be \"unremitting doom and gloom.\" \"What I think we have to convey in our report is that the activities of humans have caused climate change, but human beings also have the agency to do something about it.\" \"And that I think is a really big part of the messaging for the report.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The UN Secretary General says the rush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is \"madness\" and threatens global climate targets.  The invasion of Ukraine has seen rapid rises in the prices of coal, oil and gas as countries scramble to replace Russian sources.  But Antonio Guterres warns that these short-term measures might \"close the window\" on the Paris climate goals.  He also calls on countries, including China, to fully phase out coal by 2040. In his first major speech on climate and energy since COP26, Mr Guterres makes no bones about the fact that the limited progress achieved in Glasgow is insufficient to ward off dangerous climate change. Scientists believe that keeping the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century is crucial to limiting the scale of damage from global warming. To keep that threshold alive, carbon output needs to be cut in half by the end of this decade.  Instead, as Mr Guterres points out, emissions are set to rise by 14%. \"The problem was not solved in Glasgow,\" Mr Guterres says, in a speech delivered at the Economist Sustainability Summit. \"In fact, the problem is getting worse.\" The war in Ukraine threatens to make that situation even more problematic, he says.  Europe and the UK and other countries are looking to cut their reliance on Russian oil and gas this year. Many are  turning to coal  or imports of  liquefied natural gas  as alternative sources.  But Mr Guterres warns this short-term approach heralds great danger for the climate. \"Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,\" Mr Guterres said. \"This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.\" Countries must \"accelerate the phase out of coal and all fossil fuels,\" and implement a rapid and sustainable energy transition.  It is \"the only true pathway to energy security.\" Mr Guterres says the solutions to the climate crisis mostly lie in the hands of the G20 group of richest nations, which produce around 80% of global emissions.  While many of these countries have taken great steps to slash emissions by 2030, there are a \"handful of holdouts, such as Australia.\" Coal must be banished, Mr Guterres says, with a full phase-out for richer nations by 2030, and 2040 for all others, including China. Coal \"is a stupid investment,\" according to the Secretary General, \"leading to billions in stranded assets.\" He says the way forward is to build coalitions to help major emerging economies to move rapidly away from fossil fuels.  He highlights the case of South Africa. During COP26 several countries including the UK, US and others  agreed to an $8.5bn financing programme  to end South Africa's reliance on coal.  Mr Guterres says the pieces are coming together for similar coalitions in Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere.  Money is one of the key problems in addressing the climate issue and Mr Guterres has called for a major ramping up in finance to help countries adapt to rising temperatures.  He points out that right now, one person in three globally is not covered by early warning systems for disasters - in Africa six in ten people are not protected.  In 2022, he argues, richer countries must finally make good on their  well-worn promise to provide a $100bn a year  to the developing world. Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Early warning systems to protect the entire world from extreme weather and climate disasters should be rolled out within five years, according to the UN. Right now, around one-third of the global population has no cover while in Africa 60% of the population is unprotected.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will put together a plan on how this can be achieved by November. Around $1.5bn will be needed to finance the development.  Over the past 50 years, a weather, climate, or water-related disaster has occurred on average every day.  As the world warms, these weather related extreme events are on the increase, going up five-fold over the past half-century.  But better warning systems have ensured that the number of people killed in these floods and storms has fallen significantly in the same period.  However, the scale of improvement depends very much on where you live.  Last year, when Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, it was the fifth strongest such storm to hit the continental US.  Thanks to effective forecasting and early warning, tens of thousands of people  were mandated to evacuate  and overall deaths were less than 100. Contrast that with  Cyclone Idai  which hit Southern Africa in 2019, leaving around a thousand people dead across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe and millions more in need of humanitarian assistance.  While warnings were issued, the dissemination of the information, particularly in rural areas was not effective.  \"This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse,\" said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a video statement to launch the new plan. \"Early warnings and action save lives. We must boost the power of prediction for everyone and build their capacity to act.\" The UN has now asked the WMO to develop a scheme so that early notifications of these type of extreme events can cover everyone on the planet within five years.  The greatest need is in parts of Central and West Africa, in the Caribbean and in small island developing states in the Pacific. The WMO will look to put in place the technology that will involve real-time monitoring of the atmosphere so that people in these areas are made aware that a flood, a heatwave, or storm is on its way.  Crucially, the systems should also help inform governments, communities, and individuals on how to act to minimise damage.  The WMO estimates that it will cost around $1.5bn to improve the meteorological warning systems and build the knowledge in the least developed countries.  The money will be raised from funding institutions like the World Bank and the Green Climate Fund.  \"It will not be easy, it will be challenging, but when one looks at the potential costs of mobilising the resources to make this a reality, it's a mere fraction, a mere rounding error of the $14tn mobilised by G20 countries over the last two years to recover their economies from Covid-19,\" said a senior UN official.  Experts say that this type of spending repays itself in a very short time.  According to the  Global Commission on Adaptation , an investment of $800m can result in avoided losses of as much as $16bn, which is 20 times the initial outlay. Campaigners have welcomed the idea of better warning systems but believe it's the least that the richer world can do for countries that are living with the impacts of a warmer climate.  \"The early warning systems are vital in saving lives but we must not stop at just preventing deaths,\" said Mohammed Adow from the campaign group Power Shift Africa. \"If people survive a climate disaster but then are left to fend for themselves with their homes and livelihoods destroyed, it's a meagre blessing. \"The global community needs to ensure the victims of climate catastrophes are helped to thrive, not just survive.\" The WMO proposals will be unveiled at COP27 in Egypt in November.

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter UN scientists have worked through the weekend to complete a key report on how to restrict the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet.  Members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are likely to advise a rapid shift from fossil fuels over the next 8 years. They will also suggest the widespread use of carbon removal technology to limit dangerous warming. But disputes over the exact wording of the document have delayed agreement.  The IPCC is set to publish their findings on what we can do to stem climate change on Monday.  Most of the world's leading researchers on climate change are involved in the production of IPCC reports  - their summaries of the latest science, produced every six or seven years, are used by governments in their negotiations on climate change, such as those that took place at COP26 last November.  These IPCC reports are seen as the best, if slightly conservative studies on the state of climate science.  For the past two weeks, IPCC scientists and government officials from all over the world have been locked in a virtual approval session, going through this latest report on how to stop climate change line by line.  This new study will be the third of three important documents from the IPCC issued over the past eight months.  The previous two have looked at the  causes  and  impacts  of climate change, but this one will focus on mitigation - or what we can do to stop it. This essentially means that researchers will look at how we can reduce the amount of warming gases that are emitted from human activities. One key part of the summary report will detail what the world can do between now and 2030 to limit heating.  IPCC scientists have previously warned that to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century, emissions from warming gases would have to halve by the end of this decade.  In this new study, the researchers will likely be encouraging a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, especially over the next eight years. But this is sensitive territory - many large developing countries say that they should have the right to continue to use coal, oil and gas for longer, to help grow their economies.  Some major fossil fuel producers are also reluctant to embrace the urgency of cutting these fuels that scientists say is absolutely necessary. Other countries have also taken issue with questions around the use of nuclear energy.  These divisions have seen the approval session continue way past its official closing time on Friday.  According to one person with knowledge of the proceedings, it is not a surprise that the talks are running late as everyone recognises the implications this report will have on decisions that will have to be taken in next few years.  Another key part of the report will be the focus on approaches to remove CO2 from the air.

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter The dangers of climate change have been well reported for years. But what's had less attention is how the world could effectively tackle the issue. Yesterday, UN  scientists laid out a plan  that they believe could help people avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures. The report, by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), essentially calls for a revolution in how we produce energy and power our world.  To avoid very dangerous warming, carbon emissions need to peak within three years, and fall rapidly after that.  Even then, technology to pull CO2 from the air will still be needed to keep temperatures down. Here are five key ideas that the researchers say are critical to keeping the world safe.  The 63 dense pages of  this IPCC report  are littered with qualifications and dense footnotes.  But all the verbiage can't hide the scientists' central message. If the world wants to steer clear of dangerous warming, fossil fuels are toast.  Keeping the world under 1.5C requires emissions to peak by 2025, the researchers say, and shrink by 43% by the end of this decade.  The most effective way of making that switch is to generate energy from sustainable sources like wind and solar.  The authors point to the collapse in costs of these technologies, down around 85% across the decade from 2010.  And while the war in Ukraine is making governments in Europe flirt with carbon-rich coal once again, there's wide political acceptance that cheap, sustainable energy is the only road to Putin-free power.  So for the temperature of the planet (as well as the politics of the present), the IPCC believes that coal should finally be retired for good. \"I think that's a very strong message, no new coal power plants. Otherwise, you're really risking 1.5C,\" said Prof Jan Christoph Minx, from the University of Leeds, and an IPCC co-ordinating lead author. \"I think the big message coming from here is we need to end the age of fossil fuel. And we don't only need to end it, but we need to end it very quickly.\" A few short years ago, the idea of a technological fix to climate change was generally seen as the preserve of the eccentric.  From spraying things into the atmosphere to cool the Earth to blocking out the Sun with space-based shields, various ideas were mocked, knocked and quickly forgotten.  But as the climate crisis has escalated and cutting carbon emissions has proven difficult, researchers have been forced to look again at the role of technology in both limiting and reducing CO2 in the atmosphere.  The idea of  carbon dioxide removal  (CDR) has now gone fully mainstream with the endorsement of the IPCC in this latest report.  The scientists are blunt - keeping temperatures down won't really be possible without some form of removal, be it via trees or air filtering machines.  There's a lot of opposition from environmentalists, some of whom accuse the IPCC of giving in to fossil fuel producing countries and putting far too much emphasis on technologies that in essence remain unproven. \"The major shortcoming that I see is that the report is way too weak on the rapid phase out of fossil fuels,\" said Linda Schneider from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation in Berlin. \"I would have hoped that the report would have put forward the most reliable kind of safe pathways towards 1.5C without an overshoot and reliance on technologies that we just don't know if they will work.\" One of the big differences with this report from previous releases is that social science features heavily.  This is mainly focussed on the ideas of reducing people's demand for energy in the areas of shelter, mobility and nutrition.  This covers a multitude of areas - including low carbon diets, food waste, how we build our cities, and how we shift people to more carbon friendly transport options.  The IPCC believes changes in these areas could limit emissions from end-use sectors by 40-70% by 2050, while improving well-being. That's a huge goal but the report is quite specific and detailed - and yes it will take incentives and nudges from governments.  But it feels like a fairly painless way to really make an impact.  Tackling climate change has often been delayed due to the perceived high-cost implications.  But that sense has changed in recent years as the  financial toll of climate disasters  has steadily climbed. Now the IPCC are weighing in with some new guidance on the costs.  The bottom line is that transforming our world, won't (and please pardon the pun) cost the Earth.  Right now, the IPCC says there is far too much money still flowing towards fossil fuels and not to clean energy climate solutions. If fossil fuel subsidies from governments were removed, this would reduce emissions by up to 10% by 2030, according to Greenpeace.  In the longer term, the IPCC says that models that incorporate the economic damages caused by climate change show that the global cost of limiting warming to 2C over this century is lower than the global economic benefits of reducing warming.  Keeping temperatures well under 2C costs a bit more, but not much, given the avoided damages, and wide range of co-benefits such as cleaner air and water.  \"If you take the most aggressive scenarios in the entire report, it would cost, at most 0.1% of the rate of annual GDP growth assumed,\" said Prof Michael Grubb, from University College London, a co-ordinating lead author of the report.  There is renewed emphasis in this report on the outsized impact that richer people are having on the planet.  According to the IPCC, the 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute up to 45% of consumption-based household greenhouse gas emissions. In essence, the report says that the world's richest people are spending way too much of their money on mobility, including on private jets. So you would think that this would make them good targets for greater taxation or other means of curtailing their emissions?  That may well be the case, but some IPCC authors believe the rich have other roles to play in helping the world towards net-zero.  \"Wealthy individuals contribute disproportionately to higher emissions but they have a high potential for emissions reductions, whilst maintaining high levels of well-being and a decent living standard,\" said Prof Patrick Devine-Wright, an IPCC lead author from the University of Exeter.  \"I think there are individuals with high socioeconomic status who are capable of reducing their emissions by becoming role models of low carbon lifestyles, by choosing to invest in low carbon businesses and opportunities, and by lobbying for stringent climate policies.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"Matt McGrath Environment correspondent @mattmcgrathbbc on Twitter UN scientists have unveiled a plan that they believe can limit the root causes of dangerous climate change.  A key UN body says in a report that there must be \"rapid, deep and immediate\" cuts in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Global emissions of CO2 would need to peak within three years to stave off the worst impacts.  Even then, the world would also need technology to suck CO2 from the skies by mid-century. After a contentious approval session where scientists and government officials went through the report line by line, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now published its guidance on what the world can do to avoid an extremely dangerous future. First, the bad news - even if all the policies to cut carbon that governments had put in place by the end of 2020 were fully implemented, the world will still warm by 3.2C this century. This finding has drawn the ire of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. \"Some government and business leaders are saying one thing - but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.\" That sort of temperature rise would see our planet hit by \"unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages\".  To avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, say researchers.  The good news is that this latest IPCC summary shows that it can be done, in what Mr Guterres calls a \"viable and financially sound manner\".  But keeping temperatures down will require massive changes to energy production, industry, transport, our consumption patterns and the way we treat nature.  To stay under 1.5C, according to the IPCC, means that carbon emissions from everything that we do, buy, use or eat must peak by 2025, and tumble rapidly after that, reaching net-zero by the middle of this century. To put it in context, the amount of CO2 that the world has emitted in the last decade is the same amount that's left to us to stay under this key temperature threshold.  \"I think the report tells us that we've reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5C,\" said IPCC lead author Heleen De Coninck, who's Professor of Socio-Technical Innovation and Climate Change at Eindhoven University of Technology. Speaking to BBC News she said: \"We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that, reduce them very rapidly.  \"And we will have to do negative emissions or carbon dioxide removal in the second half of the century, shortly after 2050, in order to limit warming to 1.5C.\" The next few years are critical, say the researchers, because if emissions aren't curbed by 2030, it will make it nigh on impossible to limit warming later this century.  Key to that in the short term will be how we generate energy. Luckily, solar panel and wind turbines have never been cheaper, having fallen in cost by around 85% over the past decade.  \"It's game over for the fossil fuels that are fuelling both wars and climate chaos,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session. \"There's no room for any new fossil fuel developments, and the coal and gas plants we already have need to close early.\" But diets and lifestyles will also need changing, with huge scope for major carbon savings, according to the authors.  \"Having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This offers significant untapped potential,\" said IPCC Co-chair Priyadarshi Shukla.  \"The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and wellbeing.\" In practice, this means governments doing more to encourage walking and healthy eating, and putting in place the infrastructure for far more electric vehicles. One of the most contentious aspects of the report concerns the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  This can be done in a number of different ways, including through planting trees and making changes to farming practices.  But the report finds that to keep warming from going over the dangerous 1.5C threshold, we will need more than new forests.  Keeping temperatures down will require machines to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This is very contentious as the technology is new and currently very expensive.  Some participants in the IPCC process are highly sceptical that these approaches will work.  \"The idea of quick emissions reductions and large negative emissions technologies are a concern,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL, who was an observer in the approval session. \"There are a lot of pipe dreams in this report.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A key finding in the latest IPCC climate report has been widely misinterpreted, according to scientists involved in the study.  In the document, researchers wrote that greenhouse gases are projected to peak \"at the latest before 2025\". This implies that carbon could increase for another three years and the world could still avoid dangerous warming.  But scientists say that's incorrect and that emissions need to fall immediately. The IPCC's  most recent report  focused on how to limit or curtail emissions of the gases that are the root cause of warming. In their summary for policymakers, the scientists said it was still possible to avoid the most dangerous levels of warming by keeping the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. This will take a herculean effort, with carbon emissions needing to shrink by 43% by the end of this decade to stay under this threshold of danger.  But before they fall, emissions need to reach a peak - and it's in the text explaining this idea that the report becomes confusing. \"Global greenhouse gases are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest by 2025, in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5C,\" the summary states. Most media outlets including the BBC concluded that meant emissions could rise until 2025 and the world could still stay under 1.5C.  \"When you read the text as it's laid out, it does give the impression that you've got to 2025 which I think is a very unfortunate outcome,\" said Glen Peters, from the Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, and an IPCC lead author.   \"It's an unfortunate choice of wording. That is, unfortunately, going to potentially have some rather negative consequences.\" So what went wrong?  It's partly because the climate models that scientists use to project temperatures work in five-year blocs, so 2025 follows 2020 for example, without reference to the years in between. \"Because models work on 5-year increments, we can't derive statements with higher precision,\" said Dr Joeri Rogelj, from Imperial College London, and an IPCC lead author. \"But when you look at the scientific data supporting this headline, it becomes immediately clear that any scenario in line with 1.5C drops emissions from 2020 to 2025. Even for scenarios that limit warming to 2C this is also the case.\" Another issue was timing.  Covid delayed the mitigation report by about a year but the information used came from models that projected peaking, by and large, in 2020. \"The headline statement couldn't say emissions should have peaked already, as governments and scientists need to agree on messaging that is scientifically accurate without being policy prescriptive,\" said Dr Edward Byers, an IPCC contributing author from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. This led to a lengthy debate during the two-week long approval session between the scientists and government officials over the exact words to use.  \"There were many discussions about whether words such as \"now\" or \"immediately\" can be used,\" said Dr Byers.  \"Some parties or people had concerns that that this would soon be out of date. And if the report was read in the future then \"immediately\" doesn't mean anything.\" \"I don't personally agree with that so I think 'immediately' would have been the best word to use.\" A major challenge in communicating complex messages about climate change is that the more simplified media reports of these events often have more influence than the science itself.  This worries observers who argue that giving countries the impression that emissions can continue to grow until 2025 would be a disaster for the world.  \"We definitely don't have the luxury of letting emissions grow for yet another three years,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace.   \"We have eight years to nearly halve global emissions. That's an enormous task, but still doable, as the IPCC has just reminded us - but if people now start chasing emissions peak by 2025 as some kind of benchmark, we don't have a chance.\" Follow Matt on Twitter  @mattmcgrathbbc Mariupol defenders ignore Russia surrender deadline Trucks stuck for miles to meet deadline to leave EU North Korea's missile and nuclear programme No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha Could rethink of US police traffic stops save lives?

{"id":null,"body":"By Helen Briggs Environment correspondent Scientists have mapped coral reefs in the Caribbean to identify those most likely to survive climate change. Corals with the highest potential to escape destruction from marine heat waves are predominantly located along the northern shoreline of Cuba. And other promising sites are clustered around the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, eastern Jamaica, and the US state of Florida. Coral reefs are wonders of the ocean. Made up of hundreds of thousands of tiny creatures, they are one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet. According to a recent IPCC report (top-level UN reports written by scientists), at up to 1.5C of warming, only 10 to 30% of coral reefs are expected to survive. If warming is above that, survival prospects plummet drastically. The research team compared different climate models and examined factors such as hurricane damage and heat stress. They used this to define a list of coral that are priorities for protection due to their better resilience to climate change. Locating and managing the places that hold \"greatest promise to sustain key species will be critical for helping these precious habitats persist as the planet continues to warm,\" said lead researcher, Iliana Chollett. The insights are already shaping reef conservation efforts \"to deliver durable, climate-smart protection for those ecosystems most likely to survive this century,\" added Ximena Escovar-Fadul, of global environmental non-profit, The Nature Conservancy. But the scientists say their research - in line with other studies - shows coral reefs will not survive 2C of warming, meaning urgent greenhouse gas emission reductions are needed to save them for future generations. The research is published in the journal, Global Change Biology.  Follow Helen  on Twitter.

{"id":null,"body":"By Marco Silva and Merlyn Thomas BBC climate disinformation reporters A dozen scientists, politicians, and campaigners say they have been tricked into participating in online events promoting climate-change denial. The events were organised by the Creative Society, an international activist group that denies global warming is being caused by human activity.  The overwhelming majority of scientists agree greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are causing a rise in global temperatures. But the Creative Society alleges, without any credible evidence, a conspiracy and condemns what it calls the \"CO2 fraud\". The group told BBC News it \"provides a platform for all ideas to be expressed\" and rejected allegations it tricked anyone into participating in its events. The Creative Society says it has supporters in more than 100 countries but seems to be most popular in Eastern and Central Europe. The group runs a network of more than 200 accounts - with hundreds of thousands of followers - across all major social media platforms.  And through them, bad information about global warming is being spread. BBC News has seen dozens of posts denying elementary facts of climate change.  The group has uploaded videos on YouTube falsely describing greenhouse gases as \"the scam of the century\".  On TikTok, it links - without credible evidence - the melting of glaciers to \"cosmic pulses of galactic interactions\".  And on Facebook, it has paid to promote videos wrongly describing renewable energies as a \"scam\".  It also tweeted memes about \"corrupted scientists... lying about the causes of climate change\". Asked why it was using social media to promote climate denial, Alexey Prudkov, coordinator of the Creative Society project in Switzerland, told BBC News: \"Climate denialism is a very catchy and at the same time totally misleading term.\"  But asked whether global warming was being primarily caused by human activities - such as the burning of fossil fuels - he replied: \"No, it's not.  \"CO2 is only 0.04% of the total gases in our atmosphere.\"  This figure is accurate but fails to show how effective carbon dioxide is in trapping the Earth's heat. \"The problem with 99% of scientific literature is that it only studies one factor,\" Mr Prudkov said.  \"We call for true science that studies the problem from all angles.\"  TikTok, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube, said they had opened investigations into Creative Society accounts, after being contacted by BBC News. On social media, the organisation drums up support for its online conferences, featuring sharp-looking volunteers speaking from their carefully lit living rooms.  They also include short films depicting footage of natural disasters, played over loud, apocalyptic tracks.  The group's last two conferences went on for more than 11 hours.  Broadcast in dozens of languages, they have amassed thousands of views online.  In these videos, the Creative Society promises to reveal \"the truth\" about the climate crisis.  They offer testimonies from high-profile guests from around the world - all seemingly backing the group and its ideas. But several told BBC News they regretted participating.  Some said they had been unaware of the group's views on climate change, others their interviews had been manipulated. \"I have been tricked,\" Dr Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, in Bangladesh, said. Dr Huq has contributed to major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body considered to set the gold standard for climate science. When Creative Society volunteers invited him for an interview, he simply \"didn't think very much about it\". He had been told the footage would be shown at an international conference, he said, but had not asked who the other contributors would be. And only after it aired, last year, did he realise something was amiss. \"I got a message from a couple of people saying, 'Do you know who these people are and what they believe in?'\" Dr Huq said.  \"That's when I looked into it - and saw they were not what I had thought they were.\" The Creative Society denies it deceived any of its guests. \"It was a certain lack of due diligence [from the guests],\" Mr Prudkov told BBC News. Information about the group and links to its website had been included in each invitation. \"We have been actively communicating about climate change for several years,\" he said. \"We always openly stated our position.  \"Before any interview recording, we have a pre-call via Zoom where we explain what we are talking about and who the other participants are. \"We took the time to reach out to every contributor after the conferences aired, asking them to share their impressions.\" BBC News has seen several of the invitations.  They clearly identify climate change as one the topics of these conferences. But there is no mention of the group's views or denial of human-driven climate change. Dr Huq has asked the Creative Society to stop using his interview in online materials. In response, Mr Prudkov told BBC News, it would not include Dr Huq's footage \"in any future material\". And the interview has been removed from the group's website and most social-media accounts. Several others invited to contribute to Creative Society conferences last year told BBC News they had been unaware of the group's views on climate change when they had accepted an interview request. The office of Juraj Smatana, a State Secretary at Slovakia's Ministry of Environment, said his pre-recorded contribution had been \"manipulated\" to give the impression he agreed with the views presented at the conference. Mr Smatana is one of the ministry's highest ranking officials. It told BBC News legal action against the Creative Society was being considered. Other guests have also suggested their pre-recorded contributions were misrepresented. Portuguese Euro-MP Carlos Zorrinho said he had been \"urged several times\" during his interview to praise the work of the Creative Society. \"That did not please me,\" he told BBC News. Jeff Masters, a US meteorologist who studies extreme weather events, said: \"They were definitely selective about what I said. \"They did not include any of the parts where I talked about human-caused climate change.\" The Creative Society denies accusations of manipulation or coaching.  \"Media outlets edit the material to fit the time constraints and present the viewers with only the most essential information,\" Mr Prudkov said.  And the group was promoting \"truthful information about the true causes\" of climate change.  Anyone unhappy with their appearance on the videos should contact the society, which will \"accommodate their requests\", it says. But why would the group interview people it fundamentally disagrees with?  It did not target anyone in particular and believed in allowing a platform for a wide spectrum of opinions, Mr Prudkov said. But some of the guests told BBC News its real intent was to gain credibility. \"They're drawing on the legitimate voices but then debunking what we are saying, in the overall impression that they are giving information,\" Dr Huq said.  Mr Prudkov told BBC News \"thousands of people\" had been invited to Creative Society conferences. In online posts, volunteers can be seen handing invitations to Hollywood stars including Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Elijah Wood. None of them attended and there is no suggestion any back the group or its ideas - but it has allowed it to feature stars in its videos.  Another conference is scheduled in May. The Creative Society calls itself as a \"project of all humanity\" that, Mr Prudkov said, was \"aiming to take our civilization out of this deadlock of self-destruction\".  But its structure and finances are opaque.  And while it claims to have no leaders, one man features prominently in the group's social-media posts. Igor Mikhailovich Danilov, a soft-spoken chiropractor, is also a leading figure in the AllatRa Ukrainian spiritual movement, whose members are among the founders of the Creative Society.  Mr Prudkov told BBC News Mr Danilov described himself as a \"participant, a volunteer\" of the Creative Society. AllatRa is known for promoting pseudoscience and wild conspiracy theories involving aliens and secretive powerful elites that sacrifice children.  In 2017, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate warned against AllatRa's \"destructive activities\", describing it as an \"occult para-religious organisation\". Three years later, the Church's Chelyabinsk diocese, in west-central Russia, said it was concerned about what it considered a \"psychocult\". The AllatRa movement did not respond to BBC News requests for comment. It remains unclear how the Creative Society is funded but Mr Prudkov insists members are volunteers devoting their free time to the cause.  \"We don't have any external funding,\" he said.  \"This is all done by people themselves. \"There is no oil funding, or any other sources of income. \"We are not sponsored by any government or any institution.\" With additional reporting from Ilona Hromliuk (BBC Ukrainian) Do you have a story for us?

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Climate & Science A new project has been launched to address rising climate anxiety in students at the University of East Anglia. At the opening in Norwich, students told BBC News they felt hopelessness, anger and despair about climate change. They worry how they will live in a world with an unpredictable climate and the destruction of nature. On Thursday a new survey found that 45% of UK students worry about climate change once a week or more. Literature student Meg Watts, 22, said that she had experienced depression after being overwhelmed by the scale of problems facing the planet. And she sought therapy after developing disordered eating when trying to cut out food packaged with plastic. The new programme was developed with mental health charity Norfolk and Waveney Mind, who realised young people were coming for counselling about their fears about climate change. Common worries were about food security and whether or not to have children, explained Ruth Taylor from Mind. \"Young people are trying to get ready for what is coming,\" she suggests. The project aims to address taboos around climate anxiety and give students the skills to manage their feelings. The organisers say it's one of the first university projects in the UK to address the issue. It includes a series of so-called climate cafes - an informal group session where people discuss their feelings - and an eight-week course that teaches students how to turn feelings of despair and anger into \"hopeful action\". Student volunteers are being trained to lead discussion groups that they plan to extend to older generations in Norfolk. Azza Dirar, 30, said she has felt deeply depressed and despairing after witnessing environmental destruction in her home country Ethiopia. She encourages students to \"tell the truth about their feelings and appreciate the beauty of life still here\". Sitting on chairs in circles, groups of students at the launch on Tuesday described their feelings about climate change. \"I have phases - sometimes I feel like it's not my fault, it's down to people-in-power. Then I read something else that says if we are not taking action, we are like climate deniers,\" said one participant. \"I have ups and downs. My future job will be about helping people, but sometimes I think what's the point in my education if we can't stop climate change?\" another said. Political inaction and negative news stories contribute to feelings of despair, some said. Summing up their feelings in one word after the discussion, a handful of participants said \"motivated\", \"peaceful,\" \"empowered\" and \"encouraged\", adding that sharing made them less alone. Speaking to BBC News, development student Stephen Kirk, 21, said his anxieties around climate change began at school. He dug for information online about global warming and biodiversity, and became anxious and angry. \"Sometimes I feel quite alone with climate change and the emotions that I feel around it,\" he explained. But the climate cafe was a \"safe and open space to just talk\" without worrying about how others react, he said. \"I have come to terms that I'm allowed to feel angry at this situation - I didn't necessarily cause it and I was only born into it. \"I can now use that anger and that energy, and turn it into something good,\" he said. And medical student Amit Singh, 22, explained he felt \"validated\" by the discussion. \"People know it's an anxiety-inducing issue, but it's not talked about very often. Hearing the speakers' amazing talks made me feel in control when talking about my own experiences,\" he said. \"People are scared to feel vulnerable, but once we start speaking, we realise that we're all in the same boat,\" he explains, adding he thinks it's \"vital\" that climate anxiety is addressed more widely in the UK. Like others, he believes it's important people learn to manage their anxiety because it will \"enable them to play a part in addressing the crisis\". Research has found widespread psychological distress in young people about climate change that affects their daily lives. The 2022 Global Student Survey conducted by Yonder for Chegg.org found that 39% of UK undergraduates say they reduced their meat consumption in the last five years, and 26% say climate change will affect their decision on whether to have children.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The likelihood of crossing a key global warming threshold has risen significantly, according to a new analysis. UK Met Office researchers say that there's now around a fifty-fifty chance that the world will warm by more than 1.5C over the next five years. Such a rise would be temporary, but researchers are concerned about the overall direction of temperatures. It's almost certain that 2022-2026 will see a record warmest year, they say. The Met Office is the UK's national meteorological service. As levels of warming gases in the atmosphere have accrued rapidly over the past three decades, global temperatures have responded by rising in step. In 2015, the world's average temperature first went 1C above the pre-industrial levels, which are generally thought of as the temperatures recorded in the middle of the 19th century. That was also the year that political leaders signed the Paris climate agreement, which committed the world to keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C while pursuing efforts keep them under 1.5C. At COP26 in Glasgow last November, governments re-iterated their commitment to keeping \"1.5C alive.\" For the past seven years, global temperatures have stayed at or around that 1C mark, with 2016 and 2020 essentially tied as the warmest years on record . Scientists say that with around 1C of warming the world is already experiencing significant impacts such as the unprecedented wildfires seen in North America last year, or the drastic heatwaves currently hitting India and Pakistan . This update from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), carried out by the UK Met Office, says that the chances of temporarily going over 1.5C in one of the next five years have never been higher. The study suggests that temperatures between 2022 and 2026 will be between 1.1C and 1.7C higher than pre-industrial levels. The Met Office researchers predict that for any one year in the period, the likelihood of breaching the 1.5C level is around 48%, or close to 50:50. \"The basic thing that's changing is that the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, are slowly creeping up,\" said Dr Leon Hermanson from the Met Office, the lead author of the report. \"I think people are already quite concerned about climate change and it is worrying, it is showing that we continue to warm the planet and we're getting closer to this first threshold that was set in the Paris agreement - and we need to continue doing everything we can to cut the use of fossil fuels.\" The researchers say that going over 1.5C for one year isn't the same as a sustained rise where temperatures don't fall below this figure. The likelihood is that if it is exceeded in the next five years, it will fall below 1.5C again. However there is now little room for complacency. \"For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,\" said Prof Petteri Taalas from the WMO. \"And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme,\" he said. According to the study, the Arctic region will likely feel a greater impact of warming over the next five years compared to the rest of the world. The researchers say that the difference in temperatures from the long-term average will be three times as large in these areas. The researchers also believe that one of the coming years will likely break the 2016 and 2020 record for warmest year. That will happen, most likely in an El Ni\u00f1o year. That's a natural, meteorological phenomenon associated with an unusual warming of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific ocean that can impact weather all over the world. \"The year we do exceed 1.5 degrees temporarily will probably be an El Ni\u00f1o year,\" said Dr Hermanson from the Met Office. \"It's on top of climate change, kind of like the wiggles on top of the trend, if you like, and the next record year will probably be an El Ni\u00f1o year, like 2016 was.\" The Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update can be found here.

{"id":null,"body":"This video can not be played Australia's new leader has vowed to take the country in a new direction, with a big shift in climate policy. Anthony Albanese, who won Saturday's election with the opposition centre-left Labor Party, said Australia could become a renewable energy superpower. He is to be sworn in as PM on Monday, but it is not clear whether his party will have a majority in parliament. Climate change was a key concern for voters, after three years of record-breaking bushfire and flood events. Outgoing PM Scott Morrison, the leader of an ousted Liberal-National coalition, thanked the \"miracle of the Australian people\" after conceding. Vote counting is still going on and he is still a few seats short of the 76 that Labor needs to secure a majority in the 151-member lower house of parliament. Final results may not be known for several days, as electoral officials have just started counting nearly three million postal votes. If the election results in a hung parliament, Greens and independents - who have been campaigning for radical climate change action - could wield greater influence in framing the new government's policies on the issue. Speaking to the BBC's Shaimaa Khalil shortly after his election victory, Mr Albanese, 59, said: \"We have an opportunity now to end the climate wars in Australia. \"Australian businesses know that good action on climate change is good for jobs and good for our economy, and I want to join the global effort.\" Mr Albanese, who will be heading Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade, also promised to adopt more ambitious emissions targets. However, he has so far refused calls to phase out coal use or to block the opening of new coal mines. By Jay Savage, Australia editor Anthony Albanese has vowed to \"end the climate wars\" that have poisoned Australia's will for emissions cuts in the past decade. He now has a mandate. The rejection of Scott Morrison's government in the big cities was seismic. It's a clear repudiation of policies that have made Australia a climate laggard among rich nations. Yet Labor has not been the biggest vote beneficiary. Unlike when the party last left opposition in 2007 on a big swing to Kevin Rudd, dubbed the \"Ruddslide\", this result has been separately claimed as a \"tealslide\" and a \"Greenslide\". The surge in vote for those candidates has reshaped Australia's political landscape. Teal independents picked up key seats in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. Perhaps most incredibly, the Greens are on track to win three seats in Brisbane. While it is a different story regionally, the result has upended many perceptions of Queensland as Australia's most conservative state. The teals and Greens want even stronger climate action than Mr Albanese, whose election pledges included a commitment to coal. Some have already suggested they will lobby him for more ambitious goals. If Mr Albanese fails to secure a majority, their voices will be even louder. Mr Albanese will fly to Tokyo on Monday for a summit with the leaders of Japan, India and the US, known as the Quad. As he will be representing Australia as its prime minister, he will be sworn into office before his departure. \"Obviously the Quad leaders meeting is an absolute priority for us,\" he told journalists on Sunday. \"It's an opportunity for us to send a message that there is a change of government and that there will be a change of policies on things like climate change. \"I will return to Australia on Wednesday and then we'll get down to business.\" He said he wanted to \"change the country and change the way that politics operates in this country\". One of Australia's longest-serving politicians, Mr Albanese served briefly as deputy prime minister to Kevin Rudd in 2013 and has long been a favourite of his party's left wing. Since becoming opposition leader in 2019, he has positioned himself more towards the centre. After taking over from Malcolm Turnbull in 2018, Mr Morrison led Australia through a period dominated by natural disasters and the pandemic. He had been expected to narrowly lose the election, but the result showed a collapse in his vote. The Coalition shed crucial seats to so-called \"teal\" independents, mostly women, in traditional inner-city Liberal strongholds. They had campaigned on platforms of climate action and integrity in politics. Mr Morrison congratulated Mr Albanese and said he would step down as Liberal leader after the defeat. He said it had been \"a time of great upheaval\". \"What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,\" the outgoing prime minister said. Mr Morrison, 54, is the first prime minister to serve a full term in office since John Howard in 2007. Former Defence Minister Peter Dutton is seen as favourite to take over as Liberal leader, after former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg seemed set to lose his seat. US President Joe Biden called Mr Albanese on Sunday to congratulate him on his victory. The two countries are part of the Quad group, along with Japan and India, which is holding a summit in Tokyo on Tuesday. Mr Albanese has said he will be there, a decision welcomed by Mr Biden. \"President Biden reaffirmed the United States' steadfast commitment to the US-Australia alliance and his intent to work closely with the new government to make it stronger still,\" the White House said. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he looked forward to working with Mr Albanese \"in the weeks, months and years ahead as, together, we tackle shared challenges and demonstrate the importance of our shared values\". New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern said she had \"a warm conversation\" with Mr Albanese, describing Australia as \"our most important partner\". Indian PM Narendra Modi also congratulated Mr Albanese on his party's election victory.

{"id":null,"body":"By Marco Silva BBC climate disinformation specialist Climate \"doomers\" believe the world has already lost the battle against global warming. That's wrong - and while that view is spreading online, there are others who are fighting the viral tide. As he walked down the street wearing a Jurassic Park cap, Charles McBryde raised his smartphone, stared at the camera, and hit the record button. \"Ok, TikTok, I need your help.\" Charles is 27 and lives in California. His quirky TikTok videos about news, history, and politics have earned him more than 150,000 followers. In the video in question, recorded in October 2021, he decided it was time for a confession. \"I am a climate doomer,\" he said. \"Since about 2019, I have believed that there's little to nothing that we can do to actually reverse climate change on a global scale.\" Climate doomism is the idea that we are past the point of being able to do anything at all about global warming - and that mankind is highly likely to become extinct. That's wrong, scientists say, but the argument is picking up steam online. Charles admitted to feeling overwhelmed, anxious and depressed about global warming, but he followed up with a plea. \"I'm calling on the activists and the scientists of TikTok to give me hope,\" he said. \"Convince me that there's something out there that's worth fighting for, that in the end we can achieve victory over this, even if it's only temporary.\" And it wasn't long before someone answered. Alaina Wood is a sustainability scientist based in Tennessee. On TikTok she's known as thegarbagequeen . After watching Charles' video, she posted a reply, explaining in simple terms why he was wrong. Alaina makes a habit of challenging climate doomism - a mission she has embraced with a sense of urgency. \"People are giving up on activism because they're like, 'I can't handle it any more... This is too much...' and 'If it really is too late, why am I even trying?'\" she says. \"Doomism ultimately leads to climate inaction, which is the opposite of what we want.\" Climate scientist Dr Friederike Otto, who has been working with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says: \"I don't think it's helpful to pretend that climate change will lead to humanity's extinction.\" In its most recent report, the IPCC laid out a detailed plan that it believes could help the world avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures. It involves \"rapid, deep and immediate\" cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases - which trap the sun's heat and make the planet hotter. \"There is no denying that there are large changes across the globe, and that some of them are irreversible,\" says Dr Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. \"It doesn't mean the world is going to end - but we have to adapt, and we have to stop emitting.\" Last year, the Pew Research Center in the US ran a poll covering 17 countries , focusing on attitudes towards climate change. An overwhelming majority of the respondents said they were willing to change the way they lived to tackle the problem. But when asked how confident they were that climate action would significantly reduce the effects of global warming, more than half said they had little to no confidence. Doomism taps into, and exaggerates, that sense of hopelessness. In Charles's case, it all began with a community on Reddit devoted to the potential collapse of civilisation. \"The most apocalyptic language that I would find was actually coming from former climate scientists,\" Charles says. Listen to 'The online boom in climate doom' from BBC Trending It's impossible to know whether the people posting the messages Charles read were genuine scientists. But the posts had a profound effect on him. He admits: \"I do think I fell down the rabbit hole.\" Alaina Wood, the sustainability scientist, says Charles's story is not unusual. \"I rarely at this point encounter climate denial or any other form of misinformation [on social media],\" she says. \"It's not people saying, 'Fossil fuels don't cause climate change' ... It's people saying, 'It's too late'.\" TikTok's rules forbid misinformation that causes harm. We sent the company some videos that Alaina has debunked in the past. None was found to have violated the rules. TikTok says it works with accredited fact-checkers to \"limit the spread of false or misleading climate information\". Although it can take many forms (and is thus difficult to accurately measure), Alaina says doomism is particularly popular among young people. \"There's people who are climate activists and they're so scared. They want to make change, but they feel they need to spread fear-based content to do so,\" she says. \"Then there are people who know that fear in general goes viral, and they're just following trends, even if they don't necessarily understand the science.\" I've watched several of the videos that she debunked. Invariably, they feature young users voicing despair about the future. \"Let me tell you why I don't know what I want to do with my life and why I'm not planning,\" says one young woman. \"By the year 2050, most of us should be underwater from global warming.\" But that's a gross exaggeration of what climate scientists are actually telling us. \"A lot of that is often fatalistic humour, but people on TikTok are interpreting that as fact,\" Alaina says. But is Charles still among them, after watching Alaina's debunks? Is he still a climate doomer? \"I would say no,\" he tells me. \"I have convinced myself that we can get out of this.\" For more information about mental health support, visit the BBC Action Line .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent, Bonn Two weeks of climate talks in Germany have ended in acrimony between rich and poor countries over cash for climate damage. Developing countries say they are reeling from climate change caused by richer countries' emissions over hundreds of years. They hoped to get compensation onto the official agenda for discussions by world leaders in November. But here in Bonn they couldn't get the US and the European Union to agree. \"The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe,\" said Conrod Hunte, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). \"Yet within these walls the process feels out of step with reality, the pace feels too slow,\" he told delegates at the end of the meeting. Developing nations say they need money to deal with the impacts of climate change, because they suffer the effects more than richer nations and have less financial capacity to cope. They argue that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They say that Europe and the US have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. The US and Europe don't agree. They fear that if they pay for historic emissions it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The issue is termed \" loss and damage \" and has become a running sore in these negotiations. At last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, island states and developing countries agreed to prioritise cuts to carbon emissions on the back of promises that richer nations would finally set up a compensation process this year. It was a compromise they hoped would pay off. But despite two weeks of discussions here in Bonn, they have been unable to get the issue of a funding facility on the agenda for the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. \"The compromise was based on an understanding that countries would be willing to start talking and taking decisions on dealing with how to get that finance flowing for loss and damage,\" said Alex Scott from E3G, an environmental think tank. \"And we haven't seen that come to fruition here. Instead, we've seen a workshop set up to talk about how we can fix some of the problems.\" The EU in particular has come in for heavy criticism. \"The EU consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn,\" said Harjeet Singh, from the Climate Action Network International. \"The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas.\" Many participants from poorer regions of the world brought their own personal testimony of the impacts of climate change. \"We are already living with loss and damages for the last 25 years,\" said Adriana Vasquez Rodriquez from La Ruta del Clima, a Costa Rican environmental group. \"We have families who have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no-one is paying for that, we are running out of resources, and at the same time, we are depending on debt.\" Bridging the divide between rich and poor on this issue will not be easy. While the question of a financial facility will now not be on the official discussions at COP27 in Egypt, developing countries are certain to continue to insist that their voices be heard on this question.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent A new study says that the world is using more fossil fuels than ever as the transition to green energy stalls. The Renewables 2022 Global Status Report says the share of wind and solar in the global energy mix has risen minimally in the last decade. While renewables boomed in the electricity sector last year, they didn't meet the overall rise in demand. In transport, which accounts for a third of energy, renewables provided less than 4%. The current situation in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, according to the authors. REN21 is an international energy policy network made up of industry figures, scientists, and some governments. Their 17th annual status report draws on over 600 experts to produce a snapshot of what is really happening in terms of renewable energy. The study says that the transition to renewables, in essence, has stalled. The use of coal, oil and gas continues to dominate total energy consumption. \"The share of renewable energy has moved in the last decade from 10.6% to 11.7%, but fossil fuels, all coal and gas have moved from 80.1% to 79.6%. So, it's stagnating,\" said Rana Adib, the executive director of REN21. \"And since the energy demand is rising, this actually means that we are consuming more fossil fuels than ever.\" As the world rebounded from Covid-19 in 2021, there was a significant rise in overall energy use, most of which was met by fossil fuels. This resulted in a major rise in carbon emissions , which increased globally by around 2 billion tonnes. Since then, as supplies have struggled to keep up with demand, the prices of oil, gas and coal have risen sharply. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has added to the uncertainty and seen governments scampering to find alternative sources. As energy prices have risen for consumers, some countries, including the UK, have imposed new taxes on the profits made by oil and gas producers. However, many nations have also enacted new subsidies for fossil fuels. \"We're spending globally $11m per minute on subsidising fossil fuel. In 2020, this was 7% of the global GDP,\" said Rana Adib. \"This obviously creates a system which is unbalanced, because even though renewable energy is an economic alternative to fossil fuels, it's not playing in a fair market.\" While renewable energy had reached 10% of global electricity production in 2021, the problems lie in challenging areas such as transport. Cars, lorries, ships and airplanes account for 32% of total final energy consumption, but green energy only had a 3.7% share last year. According to Rana Adib, the slow progress underlines the critical importance of policies in moving markets and attitudes. \"The reality is with a ban of the internal combustion engine, there's a regulatory obligation to move away from this, so we see a trend in electric mobility, which is ramping up in quite an exponential way, and I think this is quite encouraging.\" There's also been a lack of progress on the political promises made at COP26, the big international climate conference last year. While 135 countries had net zero emissions targets for 2050 in the run up to the meeting in Glasgow, only 84 had economy-wide targets for renewables. But that was before the world changing events of the past six months. The surging prices of energy mean governments are now reaching for every tool to ease the burden on their citizens. And that could possibly see a big rise in spending on greener sources, as they are not just much cheaper than fossil fuels, they are more attractive for other reasons as well. \"The energy transition is our lifeline,\" said Teresa Ribera, a vice president in Spain's government. \"It will enable innovative business models and forms of organisation, transform value chains, redistribute economic power and shape governance in new, more people-centred ways. \"With the right investments in technology, renewables are the only energy sources offering every country in the world a chance for greater energy autonomy and security.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"Fiji has told an Asian security summit that climate change is a bigger threat to the Pacific than military tensions. \"Machine guns, fighter jets... are not our primary security concern. The single greatest threat to our very existence is climate change,\" Fiji Defence Minister Inia Seruiratu said. He was addressing a summit in Singapore which has focused on China-US tensions and the Ukraine war. Cyclones have repeatedly battered Fiji and other low-lying Pacific countries. \"It threatens our very hopes and dreams of prosperity. Human-induced, devastating climate change,\" Mr Seruiratu told the forum, called the Shangri-La Dialogue. Floods in Fiji caused by tropic cyclones have displaced thousands of people in recent years and wrought economic havoc. Pacific states have urged advanced industrialised nations to do more to combat climate change. \"Waves are crashing at our doorsteps, winds are battering our homes, we are being assaulted by this enemy from many angles,\" Mr Seruiratu told delegates. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - the result of humans burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). But much attention has focused on China's growing challenge to Western strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. In April China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands, causing concern in Australia, New Zealand and the US. The details of it were not disclosed. Besides the Solomons, Pacific island nations have not so far reached consensus on China's proposal for a new regional trade and security pact.

{"id":null,"body":"By Tiffanie Turnbull BBC News, Sydney Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced more ambitious climate targets for his country. He has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030, up from the previous conservative government's target of between 26% and 28%. Australia is one of the world's highest per capita carbon emitters. The target brings the country more in line with other developed economies' Paris climate accord commitments. Canada is aiming for a reduction of 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels, while the United States has a target of up to 52%. \"When I've spoken with international leaders in the last few weeks, they have all welcomed Australia's changed position,\" Mr Albanese, who assumed office last month, said after notifying the United Nations. In recent years, Australia has suffered severe drought, historic bushfires, successive years of record-breaking floods, and six mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. And it is racing towards a future full of similar disasters, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report warns. The former government had angered allies with its short-term emissions reductions target - which is half what the IPCC says is needed if the world has any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. The target comes as major fossil fuel companies in Australia seek to decarbonise their operations. Global miner BHP this week announced it had been unable to find a buyer for its coal mines in the Australian state of New South Wales and would instead close the project by 2030. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said that the commitment was a message to the international community. \"We send the message to the rest of the world, to our friends and allies, that we're partners in tackling the climate emergency. We send the message to Australians that we seek to end the climate wars, as the prime minister said,\" he added. \"For years, the Australian government told the world that was all too hard,\" he told a news conference in Canberra. Mark Howden, vice chair of the IPCC, said the commitment was a \"very big deal\". \"Simply numerically, we're talking around about a 15% difference. And that 15% would be equivalent to taking all of our cars off the road or taking agriculture out of our economy,\" he said. Australia is one of the highest emitters per capita in the world, but the commitment could take the number down from 24 tonnes per person down to around 14 tonnes per person, he said. While it will not result in Australia being considered a global leader on the climate, \"we're no longer a laggard\", Mr Howden said. Speaking last week, Mr Albanese said Australia had been moved off the \"naughty corner\" on climate change. \"We've been in the naughty corner for nine years,\" he said.

{"id":null,"body":"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK government must drive down energy bills and reduce climate-warming emissions by insulating more homes, a report says. Official advisors the Climate Change Committee says the government's current insulation programme is \"shocking\". It says consumers are paying \u00a340 extra a year on bills because of previous cuts to the home renovation programme. The committee also says ministers must harness the Ukraine fuel crisis to push ahead with renewables. And it says to be fair to poorer families, the portion of electricity bills that pays back historic renewables should be taken off bills and absorbed by the Treasury. The committee, also known as the CCC, is an independent body advising on climate policy. This report is an annual review of progress to MPs. It does praise ministers on two issues: it says the government\u2019s renewable energy programme will save people \u00a3125 a year on bills by 2030. And it congratulates ministers on promoting electric cars \u2013 even though it says more charge points and more electric vans are needed. In response to the report, the government noted that over the past three decades the UK had driven down emissions faster than any other G7 country, and that it had clear plans to go further. \"The UK is forging ahead of most other countries with around 40% of our power now coming from cleaner and cheaper renewables,\" it said. \"This is backed up by \u00a36bn of funding to make our homes and buildings more energy efficient, planting up to 30,000 hectares of new trees a year and more electric cars than ever before on our road - decarbonising our cars and vans faster than any other developed country.\" But the CCC warned that unless housing and farming were tackled, the UK won\u2019t achieve its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. ' Scant evidence' The committee agrees that carbon-cutting policies are now in place for most sectors of the economy \u2013 but it says there\u2019s \"scant evidence\" that these goals will be delivered. And it warns that ministers need a back-up plan, including measures they may prefer to avoid such as asking the public to change behaviour by eating less meat and flying less. The chairman, Lord Deben, told BBC News that recent climate extremes were \u201cvery, very worrying\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe public should be proud of the UK setting best targets but I\u2019m very worried that there\u2019s no convincing programme for delivering policies. \u201cI\u2019m seriously worried that we are not moving fast enough to avert real catastrophe.\u201d Lord Deben focused on what he called \u201ca lack of sensible policy\u201d on home insulation. He said it was \u201cscandalous\u201d that house-builders were still building new homes that will need retro-fitting.  Overall the committee says credible plans exist for over a third of the emissions reductions needed by the mid-2030s. With luck the UK will manage another quarter; but there\u2019s a high risk that over a third of plans won\u2019t deliver. It calls for a public engagement strategy on cutting emissions and wants analysis from the Treasury explaining how the costs and benefits of the low-carbon transition will be shared. It also urges changes in tax policy and planning legislation. This year\u2019s report runs to 600 pages \u2013 three times longer than usual. That\u2019s because instead of relying just on reported data, this time the committee has sought evidence on the ground of the low-carbon transition in action . In a briefing, the committee again rejected proposals for a new coal mine in Cumbria, but said there would only be a tiny increase in emissions if old coal stations were used to keep the lights on in the winter. It said the government\u2019s ambitions on nuclear power would be \u201cvery tough\u201d to accomplish. Greenpeace spokesperson Ami McCarthy said: \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the CCC has named this a Progress Report when the government\u2019s progress on climate policy is grinding to a standstill. \u201cThe longer this government drags its feet on greening our homes, delivering renewables and moving our food production system away from meat, the sharper and more costly the shift will be. Time is running out.\u201d Meanwhile, the engineering firm Atkins considers the CCC over-optimistic. Its separately-published analysis shows the UK needs to build 12-16GW of new generation capacity each year between now and 2035. It warns: \u201cThe pace of new-build and complexity of the challenge means a dash to decarbonise power by 2035 may no longer be a credible ambition for the UK.\u201d The CCC says that unless policies are radically improved, the government will need to try another tack by persuading people to fly less and eat less meat. The CCC also said the environment department Defra was guilty of \u201cmagical thinking\u201d over cutting planet-heating emissions from farms.

{"id":null,"body":"By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington This video can not be played President Joe Biden says climate crisis is clear and present danger US President Joe Biden has announced $2.3bn (\u00a31.9bn) to help build infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and natural disasters. But he stopped short of formally declaring a climate emergency, which would grant him further powers. Mr Biden spoke in Massachusetts as a heatwave brings extreme weather to Europe and North America. Tens of millions of people in the US, across more than two dozen states, are living under heat warnings this week. \"Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world,\" the president said in Wednesday's speech, which was delivered outside a former coal-fired power plant in the town of Somerset. \"The health of our citizens and our communities is... at stake. So we have to act.\" He said the funding would go to expanding flood control, shoring up utilities, retrofitting buildings, and helping families pay for heating and cooling costs. The money comes from an existing Federal Emergency Management Agency budget and will be prioritised for disadvantaged communities, said the White House. It includes $385m to help states fund air conditioning units in homes and community cooling centres. The administration also plans to provide additional support for offshore wind and energy development in the Gulf of Mexico, and enforce new workplace standards to help protect workers from extreme weather. This video can not be played Watch: This graphic shows how global temperatures are changing While Mr Biden said that he will treat extreme climate conditions as \"an emergency\", he stopped short of formally declaring a federal emergency. The president has been under mounting pressure from fellow Democrats and environmental groups to do so after West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin - a conservative Democrat - last week said that he would not support legislation aimed at addressing climate change, dealing a significant blow to Mr Biden's agenda. Mr Manchin raised concerns about inflation. The president said on Wednesday that since Congress \"is not acting as it should\", he plans to announce additional executive actions in the coming weeks. \"Our children and grandchildren are counting on us,\" he said. \"If we don't keep [climate change] below 1.5C, we lose it all. We don't get to turn it around.\" President Biden entered office promising to restore US credibility on climate action and overturn the \"rollbacks\" of President Trump's environmental policy. On his first day, he signed an executive order for the US to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords.\u00a0In April last year he pledged to slash US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. But the path to turn these promises into action has been anything but straightforward for Mr Biden. This latest round of executive orders demonstrates the troubles he has faced in getting climate policy through the normal routes. Ahead of the Glasgow climate conference, Mr Biden promised the US would provide $11.4bn a year in climate finance by 2024 - to help developing countries tackle and prepare for climate change. But in March he managed to secure just $1bn of that from Congress - only a third more than the Trump-era spending. Wednesday's executive orders do demonstrate Mr Biden is determined in his efforts. But he is perhaps also wary of pushing too far in using this type of presidential powers. Just last month the Environmental Protection Agency lost some of its power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court - following a case bought by 19 coal-producing states worried about job losses.\u00a0 It is clear the battle lines have been drawn in the US on climate action - and time will tell how far Biden will get in his presidency in delivering his ambitions.

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt Climate Editor Heat-related deaths will triple over coming decades without government action on overheating in our homes, warn its advisors on climate change. The alert comes amid the first UK red extreme heat warning, with potentially life-threatening record highs near 40C expected as far north as York. As many as 4.6 million homes overheat, according to a recent survey - and that's just in England. But until this summer no rules governed overheating in new buildings. \"We've been telling the government for over 10 years that we are nothing like well enough prepared in the UK for the really hot weather we are seeing now,\" Baroness Brown, deputy chair of the Climate Change Committee, told the BBC. \"We really do need to address the overheating risk in peoples' homes.\" The Climate Change Committee says that more than half a million new homes liable to overheating have been built in the UK since it first raised the issue almost a decade ago. While the Met Office classes heatwaves as \"extreme weather events\", scientific research shows that climate change is making them more likely. Heatwaves caused an additional 2,000 deaths in 2020, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Much of the risk to health is from heat inside our homes, yet the government only brought in regulation requiring new build homes to be tested for overheating in June this year. The lack of regulation is visible in the country's housing stock, says James Prestwich of the Chartered Institute of Housing, which represents housing professionals. \"We've seen buildings designed that don't cope well with the increased temperatures we now experience in summer,\" says Mr Prestwich. The problem is particularly acute in new build flats in city centres, he says. \"What we've seen is buildings that have been built with a lot of glass and not necessarily the best through flow of air through corridors.\" He could be describing Sydney Taylor's flat. She lives in a dramatic modern building beside a canal in the Ancoats area just outside Manchester's city centre. There is a lovely view from the floor to ceiling windows, but the flat becomes a greenhouse when the weather is warm. She says she recorded temperatures of 36C last summer and worries it could get even hotter this week. \"I'm just getting cooked all day,\" she tells me. \"The only breeze I have is from the fan, which is just regurgitating the hot air, it doesn't cool me down.\" \"The bedroom can be over thirty degrees,\" says Sydney. \"Sometimes I use ice packs to keep cool in bed.\" Sydney has underlying health conditions, which she says the temperatures in her home are making worse. Last summer she even slept in the communal hallway for two nights to escape the unbearable heat.  The true scale of the health risk that Britain's overheating homes present is hard to assess. Heat stress exacerbates underlying conditions like asthma, heart disease and mental illness. The symptoms of heatstroke - including confusion, cramps and fatigue - can be hard to differentiate from other medical conditions, including Covid-19. As a result, heat is not always mentioned as a factor on death certificates, which makes it hard for coroners and medical professionals to assess how big a health hazard it really is. Baroness Brown says it will take years for the rules on overheating in new homes to make an impact, and that the government must urgently act to reduce the risk in millions of existing homes. \"We don't have any policy for the existing building stock or indeed for permitted development where things like office blocks are turned into homes,\" she says. \"If we don't take more action we'll see probably at least a tripling of heat related deaths in this country.\" Retrofitting homes to reduce overheating can be very expensive, warns Professor Kevin Lomas of Loughborough University, who has spent more than two decades studying overheating in British homes. He says many homes will need new windows or air conditioning. But he also says simple measures can provide some immediate help, like electric fans and closing windows and curtains during the heat of the day and then opening them at night to let in cooler air. The problem is only going to get worse. \"When it comes to summer heat, climate change is a complete game changer and has already turned what would once have been called exceptional heat into very frequent summer conditions,\" warns Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London. Every heatwave we experience today has been made hotter because of the fossil fuels we have burned, she says. The hottest day of the year is, on average, already nearly 1C warmer than in the 1970s, says Dr Vikki Thompson, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment. Across Britain extended periods of hot weather have doubled in length since the period 1961-1990, she points out. South-east England has seen the greatest changes - with a tripling of warm spells.

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard & Esme Stallard BBC Climate & Science Children should be taught climate change in more depth and in all subjects, experts and students themselves have told BBC News. Current teaching is leaving children unprepared to live in a warming world, they warn. The extreme heat and wildfires in the UK this week could be normal in the coming decades, scientists say. Children currently study climate change in-depth in GCSE geography and science. But teenage campaigners say that because climate change is affecting all parts of our lives, it should be taught in all subjects. Campaigner Scarlett Westbrook,18, wants significant changes to the curriculum. She wrote the first student-written bill for Parliament to change the Education Act. Children deserve to be fully prepared for life and work on a heating planet, she told BBC News from Birmingham. \"Climate change isn't just about natural history. It's about people, it's about economics, politics, history and arts - and we need to learn that too,\" she says. Teenagers in a Liverpool school told BBC News they don't feel prepared. \"There's not enough information about it, we don't get told enough or taught enough. We're going in blind,\" explains Harry at St Hilda's school. Geography teacher Jordan Davies says his GCSE lessons teach climate change in a lot of depth, but his department goes even further to ensure children understand the topic. A survey by campaign group Teach the Future found that 51% of teachers think their subject does not teach climate change in a meaningful or relevant enough way. \"The education system should centre the climate crisis into every single subject,\" suggests Scarlett, who has campaigned for change since she was 13. That would include vocational subjects, such as engineering. By doing this \"the generation of tomorrow will be prepared to deal with the effects of climate change and won't be taken aback,\" Scarlett suggests. At St Hilda's school, pupils said that learning about climate change in subjects like business studies and design technology would prepare them for sustainable jobs in those sectors. Experts argue that improving climate education would also help the UK tackle global warming and adapt to it. Teenagers today are candidates for the 480,000 green job s that the government has committed to creating by 2030. That includes jobs like being a solar panel engineer or a sustainability manger at a company. Widening the climate change education provision would help train children in the required skills, experts say. The cause of climate change - additional greenhouse gases produced by human activity - are first taught in Year 7 - 9 science lessons. The potential impacts are taught at GCSE Geography. Only students that opt to take GCSE Geography can learn more about how we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, how climate change affects weather events and how we respond. In 2019, 43% of 16-year old students sat their GCSE Geography, according to the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation. Academies and free schools are not required to follow the national curriculum so would decide themselves whether to teach more, or less, about the topic. The government has promised to deliver \"world-leading climate change education\" by 2023. In April it introduced a Natural History GCSE that will teach environmental issues. But critics point out it is an optional subject, and will be in competition with other GCSEs when children decide which subjects to study.  The Department for Education told BBC News that topics related to climate change already feature across the curriculum at primary and secondary school. Labour MP Nadia Whittome worked with campaigner Scarlett on the private member's bill to change the Education Act to \"reflect the climate emergency\". It would require primary and secondary schools to teach climate change in all subjects, including vocational courses that prepare students for specific jobs such as business or social care. Aged 25, Ms Whittome is the youngest MP and says that gives her a unique perspective in Parliament. \"It wasn't that long ago that I was in school myself, and I remember not learning about this. I think that's pretty surprising for older MPs,\" she explained. Experts also argue that teaching climate change across more subjects will build young people's confidence in tackling the issue and reduce increasing levels of climate anxiety. A survey last year found that 60% of young students across ten countries felt extremely or very worried about climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"By Jane McMullen BBC News Thirty years ago, a bold plan was cooked up to spread doubt and persuade the public that climate change was not a problem. The little-known meeting - between some of America's biggest industrial players and a PR genius - forged a devastatingly successful strategy that endured for years, and the consequences of which are all around us. On an early autumn day in 1992, E Bruce Harrison, a man widely acknowledged as the father of environmental PR, stood up in a room full of business leaders and delivered a pitch like no other.  At stake was a contract worth half a million dollars a year - about \u00a3850,000 in today's money. The prospective client, the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) - which represented the oil, coal, auto, utilities, steel, and rail industries - was looking for a communications partner to change the narrative on climate change. Don Rheem and Terry Yosie, two of Harrison's team present that day, are sharing their stories for the first time.  \"Everybody wanted to get the Global Climate Coalition account,\" says Rheem, \"and there I was, smack in the middle of it.\" The GCC had been conceived only three years earlier, as a forum for members to exchange information and lobby policy makers against action to limit fossil fuel emissions. Though scientists were making rapid progress in understanding climate change, and it was growing in salience as a political issue, in its first years the Coalition saw little cause for alarm. President George HW Bush was a former oilman, and as a senior lobbyist told the BBC in 1990, his message on climate was the GCC's message. There would be no mandatory fossil fuel reductions. But all that changed in 1992. In June, the international community created a framework for climate action, and November's presidential election brought committed environmentalist Al Gore into the White House as vice-president. It was clear the new administration would try to regulate fossil fuels. The Coalition recognised that it needed strategic communications help and put out a bid for a public relations contractor. Though few outside the PR industry might have heard of E Bruce Harrison or the eponymous company he had run since 1973, he had a string of campaigns for some of the US's biggest polluters under his belt. He had worked for the chemical industry discrediting research on the toxicity of pesticides; for the tobacco industry, and had recently run a campaign against tougher emissions standards for the big car makers. Harrison had built a firm that was considered one of the very best. Media historian Melissa Aronczyk, who interviewed Harrison before he died in 2021, says he was a strategic linchpin for his clients, ensuring everyone was on the same page. \"He was a master at what he did,\" she says. Big Oil v the World Drawing on thousands of newly discovered documents, this three-part film charts how the oil industry mounted a campaign to sow doubt about the science of climate change, the consequences of which we are living through today. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Before the pitch, Harrison had assembled a team of both seasoned PR professionals and almost total novices. Among them was Don Rheem, who had no industry credentials. He had studied ecology before becoming an environmental journalist. A chance meeting with Harrison, who must have seen the strategic value of adding Rheem's environmental and media connections to the team, led to a job offer on the GCC pitch. \"I thought, 'Wow, this is an opportunity to get a front row seat at probably one of the most pressing science policy and public policy issues that we were facing.' \"It just felt enormously important,\" Rheem says. Terry Yosie - who had recently been recruited from the American Petroleum Institute, becoming a senior vice-president at the firm - remembers that Harrison began the pitch by reminding his audience that he was instrumental in fighting the auto reforms. He had done so, in part, by reframing the issue.  The same tactics would now help beat climate regulation. They would persuade people that the scientific facts weren't settled, and that alongside the environment, policy makers needed to consider how action on climate change would - in the GCC's view - negatively affect American jobs, trade and prices.  The strategy would be implemented through an extensive media campaign, everything from placing quotes and pitching opinion pieces (so-called op-eds), to direct contacts with journalists.  \"A lot of reporters were assigned to write stories,\" Rheem says, \"and they were struggling with the complexity of the issue. So I would write backgrounders so reporters could read them and get up to speed.\" Uncertainty ran through the full gamut of the GCC's publications, a creative array of letters, glossy brochures, and monthly newsletters. Rheem and the team were prolific - within a year, Harrison's firm claimed to have secured more than 500 specific mentions in the media. In August 1993, Harrison took stock of progress in another meeting with the GCC. \"The rising awareness of the scientific uncertainty has caused some in Congress to pause on advocating new initiatives,\" declared an updated internal strategy pitch, shared with the BBC by Terry Yosie. \"Activists sounding the alarm over 'global warming' have publicly conceded that they lost ground in the communications arena over the past year.\" Now, Harrison counselled, they needed to expand the external voices making their case. \"Scientists, economists, academics and other noted experts carry greater credibility with the media and general public than industry representatives.\" While most climate scientists agreed that human-caused climate change was a real issue that would require action, a small group argued there was no cause for alarm. The plan was to pay these sceptics to give speeches or write op-eds - about $1,500 (\u00a31,250) per article - and to arrange media tours so they could appear on local TV and radio stations.  \"My role was to identify the voices that were not in the mainstream and to give those voices a stage,\" Rheem says. \"There was a lot we didn't know at the time. And part of my role was to highlight what we didn't know.\" He says the media was hungry for these perspectives. \"Journalists were actually actively looking for the contrarians. It was really feeding an appetite that was already there.\" Many of these sceptics or deniers have rejected the idea that funding from the GCC and other industry groups had any impact on their views. But the scientists and environmentalists tasked with repudiating them - arguing the reality of climate change - encountered a well-organised and effective campaign they found hard to match. \"The Global Climate Coalition is seeding doubt everywhere, fogging the air\u2026 And environmentalists really don't know what's hitting them,\" environmental campaigner John Passacantando remembers. \"What the geniuses of the PR firms who work for these big fossil fuel companies know is that truth has nothing to do with who wins the argument. If you say something enough times, people will begin to believe it.\" In a document dating from around 1995, shared with the BBC by Melissa Aronczyk, Harrison wrote that the \"GCC has successfully turned the tide on press coverage of global climate change science, effectively countering the eco-catastrophe message and asserting the lack of scientific consensus on global warming.\" The groundwork had been laid for the industry's biggest campaign to date - opposing international efforts to negotiate emissions reductions at Kyoto, in Japan, in December 1997. By then, a consensus had emerged among scientists that human-caused warming was now detectable. But the US public was still showing signs of doubt. As many as 44% of respondents to a Gallup poll believed scientists were divided. Public antipathy made it harder for politicians to fight for action, and America never implemented the agreement reached in Kyoto. It was a major victory for the industry coalition. \"I think E Bruce Harrison was proud of the work he did. He knew how central he had been to moving the needle on how companies intervened in the conversation about global warming,\" says Aronczyk. The same year as the Kyoto negotiation, Harrison sold his firm. Rheem decided that public relations wasn't the right career, while Yosie had long since moved on to other environmental projects for the firm. Meanwhile, the GCC began to disintegrate, as some members grew uncomfortable with its hard line. But the tactics, the playbook, and the message of doubt were now embedded and would outlive their creators. Three decades on, the consequences are all around us. \"I think it's the moral equivalent of a war crime,\" says former US Vice-President Al Gore of the big oil companies' efforts to block action. \"I think it is, in many ways, the most serious crime of the post-World War Two era, anywhere in the world. The consequences of what they've done are just almost unimaginable.\" \"Would I do anything differently? It's a hard question to answer,\" reflects Don Rheem, who says he was \"way down the totem pole\" of the GCC's operation. \"There's some sadness that not much has happened.\"  He maintains that climate science was too uncertain in the 1990s to warrant \"drastic actions\", and that developing countries - particularly China and Russia - have ultimately been responsible for the decades of climate inaction, rather than American industry. \"I think it's really easy to create a conspiracy theory about really pernicious intent of industry to completely halt any progress,\" Rheem says. \"Personally, I didn't see that. \"I was very young. I was very curious... Knowing what I know today, would I have done some things differently then? \"Perhaps, probably.\" How do we know climate change is caused by humans?

{"id":null,"body":"By Justin Rowlatt BBC News Climate Editor Why are we seeing such brutal temperatures? Climate scientists say the answer is climate change. The Met Office estimates that the extreme heat we are seeing has been made ten times more likely because of it. We are being warned it can pose a life-threatening risk to even normally healthy people, and just look at the impact it is having in our hospitals, schools and transport systems. Now remember, this is happening when average world temperatures have only risen just over 1C beyond levels seen before many parts of the world became industrialised. One degree doesn't sound much, does it? But we're living in the hottest period for 125,000 years, according to the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We know what's behind this - the greenhouse gas emissions caused by our burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, which trap heat in our atmosphere. They have helped push the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to the highest levels seen for 2 million years, according to the IPCC. So where is our climate headed? The target set by the UN is to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C higher than pre-industrial levels. It says that should avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. To do that, emissions need to have peaked by 2025 - yes, in only two and half years. CO2 emissions from energy increased by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tonnes - the highest ever level, the International Energy Agency estimates. They need to virtually halve by 2030 - we need a minimum 43% reduction by the end of this decade, according to the IPCC. Then the world needs to scale back emissions to net zero by 2050. That means cutting greenhouse gases as much as possible and finding ways to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere to make up for any that remain. It is a huge challenge - many people believe the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. Remember that big UN conference in Glasgow last year? If all the promises governments made there were actually implemented, then we'd be looking at temperatures rising by something like 2.4C from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. But the truth is even if we do succeed in reducing emissions to that really ambitious 1.5C target, UK summers will continue to get hotter. \"In a few decades this might actually be a quite a cool summer,\" says Professor Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. We should expect more and longer heatwaves in the future, says Professor Nigel Arnell, a climate scientist at Reading University. We will be seeing more heat-health alerts, more heat-stress days - days when it is too hot to work - and damaging heat extremes to increase, he warns. So what is the UK doing about it? Nowhere near enough, is the stark conclusion of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government's advisors on climate change. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the world was at \"one minute to midnight\" on climate change in his speech opening the Glasgow climate conference. But in a report on the UK's progress towards net zero the CCC warned that his government's current policies are very unlikely to do the job. It said the government has set a lot of targets and put a lot of policies in place but warns there is \"scant evidence\" these goals will be delivered. And the country is not doing enough to prepare itself for the more frequent and intense heatwaves climate change will bring. Heatwaves caused an additional 2,000 deaths in 2020, according to the UK Health Security Agency. That figure is likely to triple in coming decades without government action, according to Baroness Brown, deputy chair of the Climate Change Committee. \"We've been telling the government for over 10 years that we are nothing like well enough prepared in the UK for the really hot weather we are seeing now,\" she says - particularly the extreme heat many people experience in their homes. It is a \"disgrace\" people are dying of heat - or for that matter cold - in the UK, says Professor Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading. Most UK buildings and infrastructure were not designed to cope with the kind of temperatures we are seeing this week and much more needs to be done to adapt them, she says. \"We have made great strides in forecasting extreme weather and climate conditions in recent years. Now we need the systems in place so that people and governments act on the warnings we can provide, whether three hours, three days, or three decades in advance.\" Myanmar military executes activists and ex-MP Russia charges Ukraine army members with war crimes Thai cave rescue: 'At first it was difficult' Video Thai cave rescue: 'At first it was difficult' Thai cave rescue: 'At first it was difficult' Video Thai cave rescue: 'At first it was difficult' The secret mission to save LGBT Afghans How off-the-shelf drones are waging war in Ukraine Face to face with the bandit warlords of Nigeria.

{"id":null,"body":"By Merlyn Thomas & Marco Silva BBC Climate Disinformation reporters What can you do when the people closest to you believe climate change is a hoax? It was during school pick-up a few years ago that Lance Lawson first asked his father about his views on global warming. \"He basically told me something along the lines of 'It's nonsense',\" Lance recalls. His dad spoke of unscrupulous politicians \"fearmongering\" for electoral gain. Climate change, he told Lance, was completely \"overblown\". Lance, now 21, lives with his father, Brian Anderson, in the US state of Florida. He was just a teenager when that conversation happened, but it made a huge impression on him. \"My father is a very smart man,\" he says. \"So I assumed that, if my father is telling me this, then it must be true.\" But, as time went on, Lance started realising his father's views weren't backed by scientific evidence - and he decided to challenge him. \"Whenever he drove me to school, I would give my own argument, and he would downplay the evidence. It would force me to acquire new evidence, and that cycle helped expand my own understanding.\" If someone close to you believes climate change is a hoax, you may find it hard to do what Lance did. Maybe you fear confrontation, maybe you simply don't know how to explain the basic science of global warming. But Gail Whiteman, professor of sustainability at the University of Exeter, says it's important to talk: \"If we don't tackle climate denial and climate indifference, then the uphill battle to find a safer future is lost. \"We need to tackle our teachers, our neighbours... All of us have to become vessels for communication.\" But how exactly do you go about starting the conversation? Sander van der Linden is professor of social psychology at the University of Cambridge, and studies how people get sucked into conspiracy theories. He says years of research have shown him that confronting people with hard evidence is not the way to go. While it might be tempting to try to bluntly fight conspiracy theories with facts, \"there's a very high chance it backfires\". \"Telling people that they don't know what they're talking about, or that they're wrong, just creates more defensive responses.\" Lance says there is a common misconception that people who don't believe that climate change is real are \"stupid or uneducated\". \"But there are a lot of people out there who are just naturally sceptical as part of their personality,\" he says. His father, Brian, is one of them - he grew up in rural Minnesota in the 1970s. \"It was incredibly cold,\" Brian says, and this made it hard for him to believe scientists who spoke of a \"warming planet\". Lance says that his father is a very religious man - so he asked him to assume that climate change might be real, and questioned whether he wouldn't then have a moral responsibility to take care of what God had provided. \"Lance spoke in a language that I could appreciate and understand,\" says Brian. \"You have to approach people in terms of where they're at.\" Prof van der Linden believes that changing the minds of climate deniers is impossible without affirming - to some extent - their worldview. He says it's important to \"[expose] techniques of manipulation\" by asking questions such as: \"Have you considered that some of these theories might be created to take advantage of people?\" No-one likes being talked down to, and the same goes for someone engaging with climate change denial. \"You can't convince someone if they perceive that there's a power differential,\" says Prof van der Linden. \"The whole point of a conspiracy is the idea that there are these powerful elites conspiring against us.\" Lance's close bond with his dad is something he believes was key to persuading him, but he also says it's important to check your tone: \"Ask yourself, 'Am I sounding sanctimonious?' Remain humble. Be gentle.\" Falling down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking can be a long process - taking months, or even years. Prof van der Linden believes that thinking you'll win someone over with a single, one-off conversation is simply not realistic: \"You have to be content with small wins, and compromise.\" And yet, some experts question whether talking to climate change deniers is really worth it. Abbie Richards researches the spread of misinformation on social media. \"Effort is better spent on pushing for actual change, rather than trying to combat solidified disinformation that has been pushed... for years,\" she says. On TikTok, she debunks disinformation about climate change, but says she's given up trying to engage with hardcore conspiracy theorists: \"I don't want to waste my energy on debunking more of their disinformation.\" But Prof van der Linden points out that \"some of these dismissive individuals are very loud and have a disproportionate influence on public debate\". \"It's quite risky to do nothing, especially when [they] have outsized voices.\" With time and patience, Lance managed to convince his father that climate change was real - so much so that he was surprised by his own success. \"One time, my dad came downstairs in the middle of the night, so enthused after watching a documentary about deforestation that he was like: 'Lance you won't believe what's going on in the rainforest!' \"It was a breathtaking moment, to see him so engaged.\" Do you have a story for us?

{"id":null,"body":"Catastrophic climate change outcomes, including human extinction, are not being taken seriously enough by scientists, a new study says. The authors say that the consequences of more extreme warming - still on the cards if no action is taken - are \"dangerously underexplored\". They argue that the world needs to start preparing for the possibility of what they term the \"climate endgame\". They want UN scientists to investigate the risk of catastrophic change. According to this new analysis , the closest attempts to directly understand or address how climate change could lead to global catastrophe have come from popular science books such as The Uninhabitable Earth and not from mainstream science research. In recent years climate scientists have more often studied the impacts of warming of around 1.5C or 2C above the temperatures seen in 1850, before the onset of global industrialisation. These studies show that keeping temperatures close to these levels this century will place heavy burdens on global economies, but they do not envisage the end of humanity. Researchers have focussed on these lower temperature scenarios for good reasons. The Paris climate agreement saw almost every nation on Earth sign up to a deal that aims to keep the rise in global temperatures \"well below\" 2C this century, and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C. So it's natural that governments would want their scientists to show exactly what this type of change would mean. But this new paper says that not enough attention has been given to more extreme outcomes of climate change. \"I think it's sane risk management to think about the plausible worst-case scenarios and we do it when it comes to every other situation, we should definitely do when it comes to the fate of the planet and species,\" said lead author Dr Luke Kemp from the University of Cambridge. The researchers found that estimates of the impacts of a temperature rise of 3C are under-represented compared to their likelihood. Using climate models, the report shows that in this type of scenario, by 2070 around 2 billion people living in some of the most politically fragile areas of the world would be enduring annual average temperatures of 29C. \"Average annual temperatures of 29C currently affect around 30 million people in the Sahara and Gulf Coast,\" said co-author Chi Xu of Nanjing University. \"By 2070, these temperatures and the social and political consequences will directly affect two nuclear powers, and seven maximum containment laboratories housing the most dangerous pathogens. There is serious potential for disastrous knock-on effects,\" he said. The report says that it is not just high temperatures that are the problem, it's the compound and knock-on effects such as food or financial crises, conflicts or disease outbreaks that have the potential for disaster. There should also be more focus on identifying potential tipping points, where increasing warmth triggers another natural event that drives temperatures up even more - such as methane emissions from melting permafrost or forests that start emitting carbon rather than soaking it up. To properly assess all these risks, the authors are calling on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to carry out a special report on catastrophic climate change. The researchers said that seriously studying the consequences of worst-case scenarios was vital, even though it might scare people. They said that carrying out this research would allow scientists to consider emergency options such as climate engineering which might involve pumping coolants into the atmosphere. Researchers would be able to carry out a risk analysis for these drastic interventions compared to the worst effects of climate change. Focussing on the worst-case scenarios could also help inform the public - and might actually make the outcomes less likely. \"Understanding these plausible but grim scenarios is something that could galvanise both political and civil opinion,\" said Dr Kemp. \"We saw this when it came to the identification of the idea of a nuclear winter that helped compel a lot of the public efforts as well as the disarmament movement throughout the 1970s and '80s.\" \"And I hope if we can find similar concrete and clear mechanisms when it comes to thinking about climate change, that it also has a similar effect.\" The plea for serious study of more extreme scenarios will chime with many younger climate activists, who say they are often not addressed for fear of frightening people into inaction. \"It is vital that we have research into all areas of climate change, including the scary reality of catastrophic events,\" said Laura Young, a 25-year-old climate activist. \"This is because without the full truth, and all of the potential impacts, we won't make the informed choices we need, and we won't be driving climate action with enough pressure. \"For years climate change has been hidden, misinformed, and avoided and this has to stop now. Especially for the younger generations who are going to be left to deal with the consequences of years of pushing the Earth to its limits.\" The study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

{"id":null,"body":"Global warming and changing weather patterns are affecting the water supply for one of the world's most important waterways, the Panama Canal, as well as access to drinking water for millions of Panamanians, reports journalist Grace Livingstone from Panama City.   The Panama Canal is a great feat of 20th-Century engineering. Upon its completion in 1914, this man-made waterway linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans nearly halved the travel time between the US West Coast and Europe. To this day, ships have to pass through a series of locks to overcome the differences in height along its 50-mile (80km) length. They are lifted up to 85ft (26m) above sea level before being lowered again.  The canal's locks act as a kind of elevator, using enormous amounts of water released from artificial lakes at the top of mountains to raise the vessels, explains Mahelis de Garc\u00eda, a Panama Canal guide.   This video can not be played How the Panama Canal was built But as global warming affects weather patterns, operating the canal is becoming an ever greater challenge. According to the Panama canal authorities, 2019 was the fifth driest year in Panama for 70 years with rainfall down 20% compared to the historic average.   But it is not only dry years that cause difficulties - heavy rain can also create problems as it can cause the artificial lakes to overflow. As dry years and storms become more common, the canal needs to find fresh sources of water and new ways to store it. Every time a ship goes through the locks, 55m gallons (250m litres) of fresh water is used, then released into the sea. On average, 37 ships go through the locks every day, using more than 2bn gallons (9bn litres) of fresh water. The vice-president of water projects at the Panama Canal, John Langman, says they are working on finding solutions to ensure the canal does not run out of water. \"We understand that the canal is of huge significance to the Panamanian economy.\" He explains that in the exceptionally dry year of 2019, the canal authorities had to reduce the amount of water they used to operate the locks, which meant that ships could not carry such heavy cargo because there was less water between the keel of the ship and the bottom of the canal.  To keep the locks functioning, the canal authorities are looking at ways to store more water in rainy years to ensure a sufficient supply in drier times. They are carrying out feasibility studies on a number of options including deepening existing artificial lakes to capture more rainwater. Mr Langman says they will aim first to find a solution within the watershed around the canal, but they may have to look at water sources in other parts of the country. None of the options are easy.  One possibility that canal authorities are studying is building a dam on the river Indio, in the province of Cocl\u00e9 in central Panama. But this could displace thousands of small farmers, and it has worried Diego Herrera, who farms 40 hectares of land with his family in Coquillo. \"What will we do if they flood our land? Where will we go? They haven't explained to us where they will relocate us.\" It is important to emphasize that this dam is only one of many possible options under consideration, and the canal authorities stress that they will opt for a solution that has the lowest environmental and social impact.  The search for water sources is not just about ships and commerce. The Panama Canal Authority also supplies drinking water to half of the Panamanian population, including the residents of the capital, Panama City. The drinking water comes from the same artificial lakes that is used to run the locks. The Panama Canal Authority is considering desalinating sea water for human consumption, enabling more of the water in the artificial lakes to be used for the canal. Environmentalist and former deputy mayor of Panama City, Raisa Banfield, says that as the population of the city grows, with more buildings constructed and forest areas depleted, there is increasing pressure on Panama's water resources. Climate change is making the search for solutions urgent. The Panama Canal has extremely good meteorological data because it has been monitoring rainfall since 1880.  Steven Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says this 142 years of data shows changes in rainfall that are consistent with climate change.  He says that in the past 25 years, \"we've had eight of the 10 greatest storms, the two driest years and the driest three years in a row, in which the average rainfall was lower than in any other three-year period. We've set all kinds of records.\"  He adds that weather patterns are becoming less predictable: for example 2022 has seen the earliest start to the rainy season in Panama since records began. \"There's no analogue to what's happened this year,\" he says. The original steel-plated gates made over 100 years ago are still opening the locks to ships from around the world, but as rainfall patterns change it is becoming more and more difficult to source the water to operate the canal.

{"id":null,"body":"By George Wright & Leo Sands BBC News The US Senate has approved a sweeping $700bn (\u00a3577bn) economic package that includes major legislation on healthcare, tax and climate change. The bill seeks to lower the cost of some medicines, increase corporate taxes and reduce carbon emissions. The passing of the bill - a flagship part of President Joe Biden's agenda - is a boost ahead of mid-term elections. But it is a significantly scaled-back version of the $3.5tn package that was first proposed by his administration. The bill, a product of 18 months of intense wrangling, passed by a margin of 51 to 50 on Sunday with Vice-President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote. It was previously blocked by two Democratic senators who shared Republican concerns about its cost. It will now be sent to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass in a vote on Friday before the president can sign it into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes legislation that would allow the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription medicines provided under its Medicare health insurance programme for those aged over 65. That is expected to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, according to estimates from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The package also includes a minimum 15% tax on most corporations that make more than $1bn a year in profits. That measure, an issue of contention during negotiations in Congress, is opposed by business groups who argue it will limit investment. The bill also includes $369bn for climate action - the largest investment in the issue in US history. Some households could receive up to $7,500 in tax credits to buy an electric car, or $4,000 for a used car. Billions will also be spent in an effort to speed up the production of clean technology such as solar panels and wind turbines. There will also be $60bn given to communities that have suffered the most from fossil fuel pollution. The authors of the bill say it will cut the country's carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The action on climate comes as the US experiences a wave of extreme weather, including a recent heatwave as well as deadly flooding in Kentucky that left dozens dead. President Biden visited flood-damaged areas of the state on Monday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said: \"After more than a year of hard work, the Senate is making history. To Americans who've lost faith that Congress can do big things, this bill is for you.\" Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, reportedly cried tears of joy as he left the chamber. \"Now I can look my kid in the eye and say we're really doing something about the climate,\" he said, according to the New York Times. Some Republicans have said they will try to stall or block the progress of the bill. Florida's Republican Senator Marco Rubio argued it was out of touch as it did not help to lower prices for working people or keep criminals in jail - \"the things working people in this country care about\". On Saturday, Congress debated a revised version of the bill, after compromises on the more ambitious original plan were agreed with two key Democratic holdouts, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Mr Manchin had feared the original bill would have exacerbated inflation. President Biden - who has called the bill \"historic\" - has pledged to return the US to the international stage on climate action. In April last year, he pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. Last month, he announced $2.2bn to help build infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and natural disasters. This isn't the all-singing, all-dancing climate mega-bill Joe Biden promised when he became president - but if it passes it will be the most ambitious action the US has taken to try to stop the planet overheating.  And the indirect impact could be even more consequential. President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has been tireless in his efforts to persuade other countries to raise their ambitions on climate change. But the US faced a credibility gap. \"You can't preach temperance from a bar stool,\" is how one Democratic senator put it. What he means is you can't ask India, China or Brazil to cut emissions unless you are doing so yourself.  That's still a very big ask, and things are particularly strained with China right now. Beijing said it is halting co-operation over climate change following senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi's recent trip to Taiwan. But with the US leading by example, the hope is that international efforts to tackle global warming will be revitalised.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent The ongoing drought in the UK and Europe is putting electricity generation under pressure, say experts. Electricity from hydropower - which uses water to generate power - has dropped by 20% overall. And nuclear facilities, which are cooled using river water, have been restricted. There are fears that the shortfalls are a taste of what will happen in the coming winter. In the UK, high temperatures are hitting energy output from fossil, nuclear and solar sources. That is because the technology in power plants and solar panels work much less well in high temperatures. The prolonged dry spell is putting further pressure on energy supplies as Europe scrambles for alternative sources after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Hydropower is an important source of energy for Europe, but the lack of water in rivers and reservoirs is now significantly reducing the ability of facilities to produce electricity. Italy gets around 1\/5 of its power from hydro, but that's fallen by around 40% in the past 12 months. It's a similar story in Spain, where the amount of electricity generated is down 44%, according to data from energy researchers Rystad Energy . \"Hydropower can be quite volatile, but 40% is absolutely extreme,\" says Fabian R\u00f8nningen, a power analyst with Rystad. The figures are not just down in one part of Europe, he explains, but all the big hydropower-producing countries are making less now. \"It's really a big impact,,\" he adds. Norway is also experiencing challenges with hydro-electricity. It warned that it may not be able to continue to export energy to countries like the UK unless its reservoirs were refilled. Some in the hydro industry say that lack of investment in modernisation and in transmission lines are also causing problems. \"We are going to face a problem this winter. And that should be a wake-up call to have more investment in the infrastructure for the next few years,\" says Eddie Rich from the International Hydropower Association.  The exceptionally hot weather is also hitting nuclear power production, especially in France. Around half of the 56 reactors in the fleet are offline, with several affected by a systemic issue with corrosion. Those reactors that are working are often cooled with water from rivers that are now running low, while temperatures are running high. \"Once the water in the rivers is very low and very hot, basically you have to stop cooling down nuclear power plants. That's because the water that's released is dangerous for fish and other species in the rivers,\" said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, from ETH Zurich. The French government is now allowing some facilities to release very warm water back into the rivers, as a temporary measure. It underlines the stresses the heat is putting on energy production. France is now making up the shortfall in electricity by importing from the UK among others. Analysts say this is putting additional pressure on the UK system - at a time when the very warm weather is hitting production from gas and nuclear facilities. It's more difficult to cool the plants in the warmer weather, explains Kathryn Porter, an energy consultant with Watt-Logic . \"Solar panels also experience quite a significant drop off above 25C. Everything just works less well when it's hot,\" she adds. The stresses in the UK system were evident this week when the National Grid triggered a capacity market notice, a technical step indicating that the safe margins for operating the grid were reduced. Countries, including the UK and France, rely on each other's electricity markets. \"If both French and UK systems are in stress at the same time, then nobody really knows what will happen,\" Ms Porter says. She said it is a foretaste of what may happen in winter and warns that there may well be restrictions on energy use for large consumers. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (\u00a38.4m) worth of gas every day. Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because \"they couldn't sell it elsewhere\". Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice. The analysis by Rystad Energy indicates that around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day. It is coming from a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg. The first signs that something was awry came from Finnish citizens over the nearby border who spotted a large flame on the horizon earlier this summer. Portovaya is located close to a compressor station at the start of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which carries gas under the sea to Germany. Supplies through the pipeline have been curtailed since mid-July, with the Russians blaming technical issues for the restriction. Germany says it was purely a political move following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But since June, researchers have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility - thought to be from gas flaring, the burning of natural gas. While burning off gas is common at processing plants - normally done for technical or safety reasons - the scale of this burn has confounded experts. \"I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,\" said Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio. \"Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high.\" Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, told BBC News that European efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas were \"having a strong effect on the Russian economy\". \"They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,\" he suggested. Mark Davis is the CEO of Capterio , a company that is involved in finding solutions to gas flaring. He says the flaring is not accidental and is more likely a deliberate decision made for operational reasons. \"Operators often are very hesitant to actually shut down facilities for fear that they may be technically difficult or costly to start up again, and it's probably the case here,\" he told BBC News. Others believe that there could be technical challenges in dealing with the large volumes of gas that were being supplied to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russian energy company Gazprom may have intended to use that gas to make LNG at the new plant, but may have had problems handling it and the safest option is to flare it off. It could also be the result of Europe's trade embargo with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. \"This kind of long-term flaring may mean that they are missing some equipment,\" said Esa Vakkilainen, an energy engineering professor from Finland's LUT University. \"So, because of the trade embargo with Russia, they are not able to make the high-quality valves needed in oil and gas processing. So maybe there are some valves broken and they can't get them replaced.\" Gazprom - Russia's state-controlled energy giant which owns the plant - has not responded to requests for comment on the flaring. The financial and environmental costs mount each day the flare continues to burn, say scientists. \"While the exact reasons for the flaring are unknown, the volumes, emissions and location of the flare are a visible reminder of Russia's dominance in Europe's energy markets,\" said Sindre Knutsson from Rystad Energy. \"There could not be a clearer signal - Russia can bring energy prices down tomorrow. This is gas that would otherwise have been exported via Nord Stream 1 or alternatives.\" Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result, and some EU nations - like Germany and Spain - are now bringing in energy-saving measures. The environmental impacts of the burning are worrying scientists. According to researchers, flaring is far better than simply venting the methane which is the key ingredient in the gas, and is a very powerful climate warming agent. Russia has a track record of burning off gas - according to the World Bank, it is the number one country when it comes to the volume of flaring. But as well as releasing about 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent every day from this flare, the burning causes other significant issues.  Black carbon is the name given to the sooty particles that are produced through the incomplete burning of fuels like natural gas. \"Of particular concern with flaring at Arctic latitudes is the transport of emitted black carbon northward where it deposits on snow and ice and significantly accelerates melting,\" said Prof Matthew Johnson, from Carleton University in Canada.  \"Some highly cited estimates already put flaring as the dominant source of black carbon deposition in the Arctic and any increases in flaring in this region are especially unwelcome.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent Around 16 football pitches of trees per minute were lost to forest fires in 2021, a new report says. Data from Global Forest Watch suggests that across the globe, the amount of tree cover being burned has nearly doubled in the past 20 years. Climate change is a key factor in the increase as it leads to higher temperatures and drier conditions. Of the 9 million hectares of trees consumed by fire in 2021, over five million were in Russia. The new data allows researchers to distinguish between trees lost to fires, and those destroyed for agriculture, logging or during intentional burns.  In 2021, the second worst year for fires on record, an area the size of Portugal was lost. \"It is staggering,\" says James MacCarthy, an analyst with Global Forest Watch. \"It's roughly twice what it was just 20 years ago. It is kind of astonishing just how much fire activity has increased over such a short amount of time.\" The impacts of fire-related losses are being felt primarily in forests in more northerly countries like Canada and Russia. While fire is a natural part of how these forests have long functioned, the scale of destruction seen in Russia in 2021 was unprecedented. Of the 9.3 million hectares (23 million acres) burnt globally, Russia accounted for more than half. \"What's most concerning is that fires are becoming more frequent, more severe and have the potential to unlock a lot of the carbon that's stored in soils there,\" said James MacCarthy. Trees and soils store carbon dioxide - one of the key gases warming our atmosphere - and experts say they are crucial in tackling climate change. Climate change is seen as a key driver of these fires, with rising temperatures creating the drier conditions in which more trees burn. Northern regions of the world are warming at a faster rate, leading to longer fire seasons. In Russia, the 31% increase in fire losses in 2021 was due in part to the prolonged heatwaves that experts believe would have been practically impossible without human-induced warming. \"Climate change is increasing the risk of hotter, faster and larger fires,\" said Dr Doug Morton, who's chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa. \"And that's nowhere more visible than forests and woodlands where you have plenty of fuel to burn.\" In other parts of the world, the impact of deforestation is also leading to more fires. In the Brazilian Amazon, which recently saw the number of trees felled climb to a six year high , the losses due to agricultural clearing and logging are having a knock-on effect. \"Deforestation changes local and regional climates and removes a lot of the evapotranspiration that help keep temperatures low and more humid,\" said James MacCarthy. \"So cutting down these forests is actually making them hotter and drier, and making them more prone to fires.\" While many of the trees that burn down will grow back over a period of 100 years or so, there are significant associated impacts of these losses on biodiversity, on water quality and soil erosion. The UN says that the outlook for forest fires in the decades ahead is grim. There is an expected increase of 50% in extreme fires by the end of this century. To address this problem, scientists say that rapid and deep cuts in global carbon emissions are key. Global leaders at the climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow last year pledged to end deforestation , but the promise must be honoured if it's to make a difference. More focus on preventing forest fires, rather than fighting them, is still needed, according to Mr MacCarthy. \"About 50% of national fire budgets are for responding to fires and less than 1% is really for preparing and planning,\" he says.

{"id":null,"body":"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Climate and Science The devastating floods in Pakistan are a \"wake-up call\" to the world on the threats of climate change, experts have said. The record-breaking rain would devastate any country, not just poorer nations, one climate scientist has told BBC News. The human impacts are clear - another 2,000 people were rescued from floodwaters on Friday, while ministers warn of food shortages after almost half the country's crops were washed away. A sense of injustice is keenly felt in the country. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the global greenhouse gases that warm our planet but its geography makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change. \"Literally, one-third of Pakistan is underwater right now, which has exceeded every boundary, every norm we've seen in the past,\" Climate minister Sherry Rehman said this week. Pakistan is located at a place on the globe which bears the brunt of two major weather systems. One can cause high temperatures and drought, like the heatwave in March, and the other brings monsoon rains. The majority of Pakistan's population live along the Indus river, which swells and can flood during monsoon rains. The science linking climate change and more intense monsoons is quite simple. Global warming is making air and sea temperatures rise, leading to more evaporation. Warmer air can hold more moisture, making monsoon rainfall more intense. Scientists predict that the average rainfall in the Indian summer monsoon season will increase due to climate change, explains Anja Katzenberger at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. But Pakistan has something else making it susceptible to climate change effects - its immense glaciers. The northern region is sometimes referred to as part of the 'third pole' - it contains more glacial ice than anywhere in the world outside of the polar regions. As the world warms, glacial ice is melting. Glaciers in Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regions are melting rapidly, creating more than 3,000 lakes, the the UN Development Programme told BBC News. Around 33 of these are at risk of sudden bursting, which could unleash millions of cubic meters of water and debris, putting 7 million people at risk. Pakistan's government and the UN are attempting to reduce the risks of these sudden outburst floods by installing early-warning systems and protective infrastructure. In the past poorer countries with weaker flood defences or lower-quality housing have been less able to cope with extreme rainfall. But climate impact scientist Fahad Saeed told BBC News that even a rich nation would be overwhelmed by the catastrophic flooding this summer. \"This is a different type of animal - the scale of the floods is so high and the rain is so extreme, that even very robust defences would struggle,\" Dr Saeed explains from Islamabad, Pakistan. He points to the flooding in Germany and Belgium that killed dozens of people in 2021. Pakistan received nearly 190% more rain than its 30-year average from June to August - reaching a total of 390.7mm. He says that Pakistan's meteorological service did a \"reasonable\" job in warning people in advance about flooding. And the country does have some flood defences but they could be improved, he says. People with the smallest carbon footprints are suffering the most, Dr Saeed says. \"The victims are living in mud homes with hardly any resources - they have contributed virtually nothing to climate change,\" he says. The flooding has affected areas that don't normally see this type of rain, including southern regions Sindh and Balochistan that are normally arid or semi-arid. Yusuf Baluch, a 17-year-old climate activist from Balochistan, says that inequality in the country is making the problem worse. He remembers his own family home being washed away by flooding when he was six years old. \"People living in cities and from more privileged backgrounds are least affected by the flooding,\" he explains. \"People have the right to be angry. Companies are still extracting fossil fuels from Balochistan, but people there have just lost their homes and have no food or shelter,\" he says. He believes the government is failing to support communities there. Dr Saeed says the floods are \"absolutely a wake-up call\" to governments globally who promised to tackle climate change at successive UN climate conferences. \"All of this is happening when the world has warmed by 1.2C - any more warming than that is a death sentence for many people in Pakistan,\" he adds.

{"id":null,"body":"Australia's parliament has passed legislation enshrining a pledge to slash carbon emissions by 43% by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. The country is one of the world's biggest emitters per capita, and the target brings it more in line with other developed countries. But critics say government plans to reach the target are lacking detail. Some have been demanding a higher goal as well as a ban on new fossil fuel projects in the country. But Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had lauded the new law - the Climate Change Bill - as an end to a decade of climate policy inaction. It marks the first significant action against climate change since the party took power in May. The Labor government's climate bill cleared the Senate by 37 votes to 30 after accepting minor amendments by independent David Pocock. Climate change minister, Chris Bowen, told parliament \"today is a good day for our parliament and our country, and we're going to need many more of them\", The Guardian reported. The former government had angered allies with its short-term emissions reductions target - which was about half what the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is needed if the world has any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. But there is strong support within the parliament for greater action on climate change. Many independents campaigned on the issue of climate change, and wanted a 2030 target of at least 50%. Meanwhile, the Greens party said the passing of the bill was a \"small step\" in tackling the climate crisis. Most also want a ban on new coal and gas projects - something they say the target cannot be achieved without. Mark Howden, vice chair of the IPCC, told the BBC in June the new commitment is a big improvement on the previous target. \"[It] would be equivalent to taking all of our cars off the road or taking agriculture out of our economy,\" he said. It could take Australia's carbon emission from 24 tonnes per person down to around 14 tonnes per person, he said. While it won't make Australia a global leader on the climate, \"we're no longer a laggard\", Mr Howden said. Canada is aiming for a reduction of 40% by 2030 from 2005 levels, while the United States has a target of up to 52%. In recent years, Australia has suffered severe drought, historic bushfires, successive years of record-breaking floods, and six mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. The country is racing towards a future full of similar disasters, the latest UN IPCC report warns. New research also shows that natural disasters have cost Australian households on average more than A$1,485 (\u00a3870; $1,000) in the past year. A report by the Insurance Council of Australia blames the soaring costs on catastrophic flooding in the east of the country in February and March. The report says costs will continue to rise for years to come because of extreme weather.

{"id":null,"body":"By Esme Stallard BBC News Climate and Science Current rates of warming will put the Earth at risk of crossing six \"dangerous\" climate tipping points, according to a new analysis. Crossing these thresholds would disrupt the Earth's systems triggering the collapse of ice sheets and the loss of coral reefs. Scientific commentators have previously said that reaching such a point would be a \"climatic emergency\". The researchers analysed evidence for tipping points from 200 recent papers. They considered: The research , based on data published since 2008, found that at current levels of global heating the world is already at risk of triggering six dangerous climate tipping points, and risks increase with each tenth of a degree of warming. The Climate Action Tracker estimates that even under an optimistic scenario if current global climate targets are achieved, the world will see average warming of 1.8 C. The idea of \"climate tipping points\" was first introduced by the UN's climate science group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), two decades ago. If crossed they could spark a significant change in the way the Earth's systems operate, affecting oceans, weather and chemical processes, which could be \"irreversible\", according to the UN . Once a critical point is crossed - or \"tipped over\" - the breakdown of the system is self-sustaining, so will continue even if there is no further warming. This is self-perpetuating: a bit like if a ball crests the top of a hill and starts rolling down and cannot stop. At the time it was thought the tipping points would only be crossed if global average temperatures increased to more than 5C. But since then there has been increasing evidence that these thresholds may be crossed much earlier. The six tipping points \"likely\" to be crossed, according to the research, published in Science , are: Lead author David Armstrong McKay, from Stockholm Resilience Centre, University of Exeter and the Earth Commission, said some destabilisation which precedes a system breakdown is already starting to be seen in the polar regions. Greenland and Antarctica are currently losing ice six times faster than 30 years ago , and Greenland's ice sheet has been shrinking continuously for the last 25 years due to climate change, according to the UN . Even though some of the other \"tipping points\" such as dieback in the Amazon Rainforest aren't expected to be triggered unless global temperatures rise by 3.5C, all of these systems are connected. So once one system begins to fail it could increase the likelihood of others collapsing. Co-author Ricarda Winkelmann, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and a member of the Earth Commission, said: \"Importantly, many tipping elements in the Earth system are interlinked, making cascading tipping points a serious additional concern.\" For example, if there are smaller or fewer ice sheets and sea ice then less of the sun's energy is reflected leading to further global warming. As well as identifying these higher risks the team also suggested that the list of potential tipping points could be increased from nine to sixteen. The team worked with paleoclimate data (climate conditions thousands of years ago), current observations and the outputs from climate models to make these new identifications. But some previously considered tipping points, for example, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have been removed for lack of evidence. Listen to The Climate Tipping Points on BBC Sounds.

{"id":null,"body":"By Matt McGrath Environment correspondent This summer was the hottest on record in Europe, according to data from EU satellite monitoring. A series of extreme heatwaves and a long running drought saw June, July and August shatter the previous high mark for temperature. The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the data showed August in Europe was the warmest on record by \"a substantial margin.\" Globally, the researchers say August was the third warmest yet recorded. It will come as no surprise to anyone who experienced this summer's intense heat across the continent that the temperature record across Europe has been broken by a large margin. According to data from Copernicus, this year saw a new record for both the summer as a whole and for the month of August. The summer was 0.4C warmer than the previous record, only set last year. August was a whopping 0.8C warmer than the same month in 2018. \"An intense series of heatwaves across Europe paired with unusually dry conditions, have led to a summer of extremes with records in terms of temperature, drought and fire activity in many parts of Europe, affecting society and nature in various ways,\" said Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist with the Copernicus Climate Change Service. \"The data shows that we've not only had record August temperatures for Europe but also for summer, with the previous summer record only being one year old.\" In the UK, temperatures reached a new high of 40.3C, recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire on July 19. It was a significant leap over the previous record of 38.7C set in 2019. These extremes were also seen in many other countries with 64 different areas of France experiencing record highs, while temperatures in Portugal reached 47C in July. Europe also experienced the worst drought conditions in 500 years. Around the globe the high temperatures in August persisted widely, with drought conditions also affecting China. But it wasn't a uniform picture - many areas had significant downpours resulting in flooding. As we've seen most recently in Pakistan, wetter than average conditions have triggered huge floods, leading to loss of life and property. The satellite data also shows that it was wetter than average over most of Scandinavia and in parts of southern and south eastern Europe, where a \"derecho\" storm brought extreme winds and rain. Climate scientists say that both extreme heat and wet conditions are to be expected in a warming climate where emissions of warming gases from human activities have driven up temperatures by over 1.1C at present.

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change threatens the health and survival of urban trees, with more than half of species already feeling the heat, according to a new study. City-dwelling oaks, maples, poplars, elms, pines and chestnuts are among more than 1,000 tree species flagged at risk due to climate change. Scientists want better protection of existing trees and for drought-resistant varieties to be planted. Trees have cooling effects and provide shade, making cities more liveable. Many trees in urban areas are already stressed because of climate change, and as it gets warmer and drier, the number of species at potential risk will increase, said Manuel Esperon-Rodriguez of Western Sydney University in Penrith, Australia. City and street trees can improve physical and mental health, are important in social integration and can mitigate the effects of temperature rises - something that hit home during the pandemic, he said. \"All these benefits are mainly provided by big mature trees so we need to make sure that what we are planting today will get to that stage where they can provide all those benefits for future generations,\" he told BBC News. The researchers used the Global Urban Tree Inventory - a database recording more than 4,000 different trees and shrubs planted in 164 cities in 78 countries - to assess the likely impact of global warming on the trees planted along streets and in parks. Of the 164 cities analysed, more than half of tree species are already at risk in some cities due to rising temperatures and changes in rainfall. And by 2050, this proportion is predicted to rise to more than two-thirds. Climate risk for species in urban areas is particularly high in cities in tropical regions, and in vulnerable countries such as India, Niger, Nigeria and Togo. In the UK, the researchers looked at five cities: Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, London and York. They found that drier weather under climate change is expected to have a big impact on trees, particularly in York, London and Birmingham. The research is published in the journal, Nature Climate Change. Follow Helen @hbriggs.

{"id":null,"body":"Carbon emissions in the Amazon region in 2019 and 2020 more than doubled compared to the average of the previous eight years, according to a new study. Deforestation for agriculture and fires were the main drivers of the increase, according to the authors. The scientists say that a \"collapse\" in law enforcement in recent years has encouraged forest clearing. The research findings have been submitted for publication but have yet to be independently reviewed. As home to the largest tropical forest on Earth, the Amazon plays a critical role in maintaining the Earth's climate by storing massive amounts of carbon in trees and soils. Over the last few decades the forest has been under growing pressure as land has been cleared in Brazil and neighbouring countries, primarily for farming. Last year researchers published data indicating that the eastern part of the forest was being cut down at such a rate that more carbon was being released than absorbed by the trees and vegetation. Now the same scientists believe that an explosion of forest clearing in the western part of the Amazon has also turned that region into a source. of carbon emissions Using small planes, the researchers have collected hundreds of air samples from different parts of the forest over the last ten years. Their new study shows that in 2019, carbon emissions increased by 89% compared to the annual average of emissions between 2010 and 2018. In 2020, the picture was even worse, with an increase of 122%. While fires played a role, the main factor was the removal of trees by land clearing, which increased by 75% in 2020. The researchers link this rise in deforestation to a rapid decline in prosecutions by law enforcement agencies, which saw fines for illegal forest clearances fall by 89% in 2020. The scientists say that this is down to the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in 2019. He has cancelled fines and penalties related to deforestation, and pushed hard for the expansion of agriculture in Brazil. \"We hypothesize that the consequences of the collapse in enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and degradation producing net carbon losses and enhancing drying and warming of forest regions,\" the new study says. The researchers say that this rapid increase in emissions from the forest has also had an impact on the climate around the trees. \"In consequence of this big deforestation, in the wet season of 2020 we saw a decline of 26% in rainfall during January, February and March, while the temperature has gone up by 0.6C,\" said lead author Dr Luciana Gatti, from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE). \"The emissions come from deforestation and degradation and also from this climate change promoted by the human destruction of the forest. And this is a very alarming scenario,\" she told BBC News. Environmental campaigners say that this hands-off approach to prosecuting illegal deforestation has continued this year, with over 8,500 sq km lost between August 2021 and July 2022, an area larger than the US state of Delaware. \"The collapse in law enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon has allowed land grabbers and illegal loggers to continue unchecked with devastating consequences for people, wildlife and the planet,\" said Mike Barrett from WWF. \"The Amazon is getting dangerously close to a crucial tipping point which could see large areas transform from a resilient, moist rainforest into a dry, fire-ravaged, and irreversibly degraded state.\" The question of the future of the forest is an important issue in Brazil's presidential election taking place in early October with the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, being challenged by former president Luiz In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva. The outcome could have significant implications for the Amazon, as scientists like Dr Gatti fear it may be reaching a point where it would continually emit more carbon than it absorbs. She said that action by consumers and governments around the world was also critical to prevent this from happening. \"We need to have an international commitment with countries in international commerce, that they don't buy the products that result in the destruction of nature,\" she said.

{"id":null,"body":"Protests have been taking place across the UK on a day of action highlighting issues including the increased cost of living and the climate crisis. Enough is Enough, a campaign set up in response to the rising cost of living, held events in cities across the UK. It comes on the day energy price rises came into effect for millions. Members of Extinction Rebellion (XR), Just Stop Oil and the Revolutionary Communist Group (RCG) were also among those marching in London on Saturday. Thousands attended the demonstrations, which also coincided with postal and rail strikes. People attended rallies in cities including Birmingham, Glasgow and Belfast. Prices are twice as high as last winter, with an 80% increase in domestic gas and electricity bills - although this has been cushioned by a government cap on the cost per unit. The government has said its energy guarantee would cost \u00a360bn for the first six months, but industry analysts suggest the total bill could be between \u00a3130bn and \u00a3150bn. As well as the huge rises in energy bills coming into effect, the rallies are also against the government's recent mini-budget, which included a \u00a345bn package of tax cuts. Those taking part include supporters of Don't Pay UK - a group encouraging householders to cancel their direct debits if the government does not offer further support to families. One protester said: \"The people want and desperately need change.\" The climate campaigners brought Westminster Bridge to a standstill as people sat in the road, chanting slogans about the environment and playing instruments. A woman called Meg, a member of Doctors For Extinction Rebellion, who was taking part in the march said: \"This is a climate emergency and people are already dying, more are going to die from the effects of climate change.\" Some carried a banner saying capitalism was \"the enemy of Mother Earth\", others were protesting more specifically against the government. A man, giving his name as George, criticised the Conservatives' record on fossil fuels and their financial record. \"No government can run if it's spending more, like vastly more, than it's bringing in,\" he said.  In Birmingham - where the Conservative party conference begins on Sunday - people burned mock energy bills in response to the rise in the cost of gas and electricity. XR staged a protest in Edinburgh as people marched to the Scottish Parliament. Retired Army officer Mike Grant, 62, said: \"The climate crisis hit the UK with a vengeance this summer. The science has been clear for years but now we are seeing what that means in reality.\" And architect Simon Clark, also 62, said: \"The fossil fuel industry has openly enslaved our society, allowing it to create havoc in the environment whilst making record profits with complete impunity.\"  Protester Lily Holder, 29, who was on a London march organised by Enough is Enough said: \"It's time to funnel our collective rage into something active and productive.\" She was among a group supporting striking unions, like the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), at King's Cross.  Some 50,000 workers from four unions are taking part in a strike on Saturday, resulting in the worst rail disruption of the year so far. \"This is an opportunity to express a shared sense of disillusionment in our Tory government,\" she said, adding: \"The people want and desperately need change - and they need it soon. This winter is a frightening prospect and is going to show the true cruelty of our government.\" Prime Minister Liz Truss has said she wants to \"get the economy growing\" and is maintaining an \"iron grip on the national finances\" She has resisted calls to reverse the tax cuts announced in Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget or bring forward publication of the economic assessment of their plans. Mr Kwarteng says further economic plans being announced next month will include a \"credible plan\" to get finances back on track.  Protests have also been held in London following the death of Iranian woman Mahsa Amini. They included one in Trafalgar Square, where people gathered to make their views heard. The 22-year-old woman died after she was detained by morality police .

{"id":null,"body":"Global warming is likely to have played a role in the devastating floods that hit Pakistan, say scientists. Researchers from the World Weather Attribution group say climate change may have increased the intensity of rainfall. However there were many uncertainties in the results, so the team were unable to quantify the scale of the impact. The scientists believe there's roughly a 1% chance of such an event happening in any coming year. In the two months since flooding began in Pakistan , tens of millions of people have been affected, with around 1,500 dying because of the rising waters. The intensity of the downpours saw the river Indus burst its banks, while landslides and urban flash floods swamped many areas. Right from the start, politicians pointed to climate change as having made a significant contribution to the desperate scenes. But this first scientific analysis says the picture is complex. Certainly, the crippling heatwaves that gripped India and Pakistan earlier this year were easier to attribute, with researchers finding that climate change had made them up to 30 times more likely to happen . But extreme rainfall events are hard to assess. Pakistan is located on the edge of the monsoon region where the rainfall pattern is extremely variable from year to year. Further complications include the impact of large-scale weather events such as La Ni\u00f1a, which also played a role in the last major floods in Pakistan in 2010. During the 60-day period of heaviest rainfall this summer scientists recorded an increase of about 75% over the Indus river basin, while the heaviest five-day period over the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan recorded a rise in rainfall of around 50%. The researchers then used climate models to determine how likely these events would be in a world without warming. Some of the models indicated that the increases in rainfall intensity could all be down to human-caused climate change - however there were considerable uncertainties in the results. \"Our evidence suggests that climate change played an important role in the event, although our analysis doesn't allow us to quantify how big the role was,\" said Friederike Otto from Imperial College London, one of the report's authors. \"What we saw in Pakistan is exactly what climate projections have been predicting for years. It's also in line with historical records showing that heavy rainfall has dramatically increased in the region since humans started emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And our own analysis also shows clearly that further warming will make these heavy rainfall episodes even more intense.\" \"So while it is hard to put a precise figure to the contribution of climate change, the fingerprints of global warming are evident.\" The researchers say that the heavy rainfall that Pakistan endured this year now has around a 1% chance of recurring in any given year, although this estimate does come with a large range of uncertainty as well.

{"id":null,"body":"The world has finally agreed on a long-term plan to curb carbon emissions from flying. At a meeting in Montreal, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), pledged to support an \"aspirational\" net zero aviation goal by 2050. The plan, seen as a compromise by many, was accepted by the 193 countries who are members of ICAO. However green groups say the deal is weak and not legally binding. When the world came together in Paris in 2015 to agree on a long-term plan to tackle climate change, two key industries were missing - aviation and shipping. The airline industry contributes around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, but scientists believe it has a much higher impact on climate change than this figure suggests. This is because of the multiple impacts of flying including the altitudes planes fly at and the effects of contrails - the water-vapour trails produced by engines. US Special Presidential envoy on climate change, John Kerry, welcomed the deal. In a tweet he said: \"Thrilled to see international aviation commit at @icao 41st Assembly to a sustainable future with a long-term climate goal... to help put aviation on the path to net zero by 2050.\" While it is not a global regulator of the airline industry, ICAO is the UN body that promotes co-operation among member states on air transport. It cannot impose rules on countries, but national governments usually abide by what is agreed at ICAO meetings. The air transport industry has been under increasing pressure from consumers and scientists to try to find ways to decarbonise air travel for several years, with limited success. At the ICAO triennial assembly in Montreal, member states finally agreed to support a net zero target for 2050, despite grumbles from China and Russia. The UK was one of the first countries to include aviation emission in their climate targets in 2021 and helped launch the International Aviation Climate Ambition Coalition at COP26. They've been amongst 56 countries pushing for an ambitious deal in Montreal. \"This week, members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed to a collective goal of net zero international aviation by 2050 - a historic milestone, not just for the future of flying, but for the wider international commitment to achieve net zero,\" said Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan. \"It represents years of tireless work by the UK and its partners to lead the world towards a clean future for all.\" However, environmentalists have major reservations about the agreed resolutions. \"You shouldn't be fooled by the results of this assembly. This isn't going to solve aviation's problem,\" said Jo Dardenne of campaign group Transport & Environment. \"The only way we're going to solve it is to stop burning kerosene. The way that you stop burning kerosene is by pricing kerosene more effectively and investing in alternative solutions.\" At the meeting countries also agreed on changes to a scheme that would deal with a large part of the future emissions from airlines through a system of carbon offsets. Offsetting is a process where companies or individuals buy carbon credits from schemes such as forestry plantations to cancel out carbon emissions from activities like flying. ICAO has now agreed that airlines will use the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme airlines would agree a baseline year and all future emissions above the level of that period would have to be offset. Initially they had planned to use an average of flying emissions in 2019 and 2020 - but the onset of the Covid pandemic saw air transport decline rapidly. While campaigners were delighted with the prospect of a low baseline that would have forced airlines to offset far more of their emissions, the industry baulked. After discussions in Montreal the threshold has now been set as 85% of 2019 carbon emissions, allowing a higher level of carbon dioxide pollution before airlines must purchase offsets. In previous analysis, campaigners found that CORSIA would add just \u20ac2.40 to the price of a long-haul flight in 2030 to offset passenger's emissions. They now say that the scheme agreed in Montreal will only cover 22% of future emissions in 2030. Supporters of the agreement believe that as well as offsetting, airlines will now speed up the development of greener jet fuels, and other technical improvements to decarbonise flying. \"A goal is better than nothing but it is up to member states now to implement the proper regulations,\" said Jo Dardenne. \"Once this target is there, even if it is non-binding, politically it still forces member states to be ambitious in their climate plans.\" Putin accuses Ukraine of Crimea bridge 'terrorism' Who - or what - blew up the Crimean bridge?

{"id":null,"body":"Icebergs bigger than city blocks loom through the mist as Kaleeraq Mathaeussen reels in halibut from the frigid waters one by one. \"Each season is not how it used to be,\" he says. It's become windier and more unpredictable. More than 250km (155 miles) inside the Arctic Circle, the coastal town of Ilulissat in western Greenland is also a busy port. Kaleeraq has been fishing the waters here since he was 14 years old and, like other locals, has observed changes around him. In winter he used to travel on the ice with a sled pulled by his dogs. But the sea no longer freezes like it used to. \"Ever since 2001 I noticed the winter seasons in Disko Bay didn't have as much ice,\" he says. \"I was very worried when I started to notice that the ice barrier was getting weaker and witnessing such an astronomical change in the climate,\" he explains.  \"Today it is unpredictable and too dangerous to go fishing with my sled dogs,\" he explains. He stopped sledding two years ago and now he only fishes by boat. Communities in northern Greenland have lived in one of the world's toughest environments for centuries. But temperatures have risen faster in the Arctic region than elsewhere on earth, and the impact of climate change is being felt on the local way of life. On the outskirts of Ilulissat, colourful apartment blocks overlook a field that's home to dozens and dozens of dogs. Kaleeraq still owns more than 30. Before he used his dogs for tourism, but now only keeps them for his teenage son. \"I still miss that way of life, but it just has to be like this for now,\" he says. Dog-sledding has been a long-held tradition in the north and east of Greenland. But many local hunters and fishermen have given it up and the number of sled dogs has slumped nationwide.  Around two decades ago there were around 5,000 dogs in Ilulissat alone, but now there are only about 1,800, says Flemming Lauritzen, who runs a dog-sledding tour business with his wife Ane Sofie. When she was growing up sled dogs were always around, she says. \"I'm not happy to see [the dogs] disappearing from our culture.\" Diseases and snowmobiles are partly responsible. Also climate change has had an impact. \"The season is getting shorter and shorter. We can feel that,\" says Flemming. Over the years they've also witnessed the nearby glaciers retreat. \"All of this ice is missing now,\" Flemming says as he points to a map of the Sermeq Kujalleg or Jakobshavn glacier. It is an outlet of the Greenland ice cap.  Over 35,000 cubic metres of ice calve from the glacier each year, and more icebergs spew into Disko Bay than anywhere else in the northern hemisphere. Tour boat skipper George Jonathansen skilfully weaves around these giants. Even young people like him have seen change within their lifetimes. \"When I was a kid, the weather was more predictable. Nowadays\u2026 we never know how the winter is going to be,\" he says. \"I think this year has been unusual compared to the others.\" This summer was cold, he says, \"A lot of places in Greenland have record rain.\" When asked about climate change, Palle Jerimiassen, the local mayor of Avannaata district says: \"We can feel it everyday. We can see it every day.\" Further north, near Thule, retreating sea ice is impacting local hunters, he tells the BBC. \"They are used to going on some very long hunting tours. They can't do it anymore. So they have to change their way of living.\" \"There's some negative things. There are also some positive things,\" he states. In some ways Arctic life has become easier. Milder winters have brought new opportunities and Ilulissat is booming.  Nutrients from glacial meltwater are enriching marine life and it's now possible to fish year-round by boat. Halibut also fetch a higher price, and fishermen like Kaleeraq are now better off. \"The dog-sled fishermen has declined. But the fishing from vessels has gone up,\" says Erik Sivertsen, CEO of Halibut Greenland. \"Climate change has made the opportunity for our local fishermen to have a greater turnover.\" It's still a worry, he emphasises. \"Of course it's very concerning.\" \"Now it [the glacier] has receded so much that icebergs are not that big. You might think they are big, but they not as big as when we grew up,\" he says. New shipping routes are expected to open up further north. Mining exploration firms have also been drawn to Greenland, anticipating that mineral deposits will become more accessible. Meanwhile glacial melting is leading to large deposits of sand along the coast, and a recent survey found that three-quarters of residents support extracting and exporting it. Research by the Universities of Copenhagen and Greenland carried out before the pandemic found that 90% of Greenlanders think that climate change is happening. Three-quarters felt they had personally experienced its effects, and a large majority said it was an important issue to them personally. While these observations are mostly anecdotal, scientists have given stark warnings about the impact of global warming on Greenland's ice sheet. Currently its meltwater adds 1.5mm to global sea level annually. Recently, a group of scientists predicted that even if action is taken to curb emissions, a rise of at least 27cm is inevitable. If the ice sheet thawed entirely this would be more than 7m (23ft).  \"In the late 90s it was in balance,\" explains Alun Hubbard, a glaciologist at Arctic University of Norway. \"At the moment it's a system that's in deficit. The amount of snow falling can't keep up with the melt and iceberg calving.\" \"What I've come to understand in the last 10 years having observed what's going on here,\" the scientist adds, \"is that there are really, really abrupt changes going on.\" In a coffee shop in the capital Nuuk, 21-year-old Iluuna Soerensen, a student and activist says, \"When you're from Greenland, you're so closely linked to nature that all the changes, you see them quite clearly.\" Skills and knowledge have been handed down from elders, she explains. \"If that knowledge is not correct anymore because nature is changing, it's quite concerning.\" \"People do get scared that their future is changing so much,\" she adds. \"But also the present.\" All photos copyright BBC.

{"id":null,"body":"Information campaigns like those used in the Covid-19 pandemic would help individuals act on climate change, a House of Lords report has said. To meet climate goals, a third of cuts to UK emissions by 2035 must come from people changing their behaviour, it says. It calls the government's current approach \"seriously inadequate\". In response the government said it is fully committed to its legally binding net zero climate goals. The House of Lords report also advises government to financially support people to move to greener diets, transport and homes. But calls to drive behaviour changes are at odds with Prime Minister Liz Truss's focus on not intervening in people's lives. \"I'm not going to tell you what to do, or what to think or how to live your life,\" she told the Conservative party conference. Ms Truss also ruled out a public information campaign to reduce energy use this winter. \"People will have different lifestyles and make different choices about what changes they need to make, but we're quite clear that people need to be helped to take this forward,\" Baroness Kate Parminter, chair of the House of Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee, which wrote the report, told BBC News. The Covid-19 pandemic provided important lessons in how to communicate clearly, using science, to the public, she said. \"Covid was a crisis, the climate is a crisis. We can learn some very important messages around the communications and the scale of the problem,\" she adds. Transport, food and energy are the key areas where we will need to change our behaviour, the report says. It recommends the government provide grants so people can switch to electric cars, and that it make it much easier to cycle and walk instead of driving. The committee strongly urges the government to consider a frequent-flyer levy, which charges regular flyers more. To address the carbon footprint of our homes and high energy bills, the committee says the government must introduce a nationwide home-insulation drive. It calls on the government to expand its ELMS scheme that rewards farmers for environmental work - a scheme Ms Truss's government is now reviewing . But the committee concluded that taxes on foods that are bad for the environment should not be introduced now. Baroness Parminter says there is \"big reluctance\" by the government to \"be open with the public about how much change is needed in terms of how we travel, how we heat our homes, and what we eat and buy\". \"We remain fully committed to the legally binding target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\" a government spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy told BBC News. The committee was told the public are eager for action and that 85% of people are very concerned by climate change. Public messaging campaigns have huge power to change behaviour, the report says, highlighting the huge uptake of recycling nationwide. But it insists that fairness must be at the heart of change. The wealthiest 10% in Britain have a carbon footprint nearly double the national average, and greater responsibility to reduce their emissions, the committee was told. It also warned that corporate interest may try to prevent behaviour change - pointing to tobacco companies that undermined anti-smoking campaigns - and the government must guard against this.

{"id":null,"body":"Imagine a huge seaweed farm the size of Croatia floating in the South Atlantic between Africa and South America. Spinning in a natural ocean eddy, it sucks a billion tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere every year and sinks it to the ocean floor out of harm's way. Far-fetched? Maybe. But a British businessman plans to have this up and running by 2026. Scientists say reducing the world's emissions probably won't be enough and that carbon capture will be crucial to limiting global warming. But\u202fcarbon capture schemes have so far been relatively low-scale and seen limited success. If they are going to work, they need to be bold, big, and attractive to investors. Businessman John Auckland believes he has just such an idea. He wants to exploit what he calls \"the wondrous properties\" of the floating seaweed sargassum. He's confident his Seafields floating farm will draw sufficient CO2 from the air to moderate the effects of climate change, while also earning its backers carbon credits. At 55,000 sq km (21,200 sq miles) Auckland is thinking big. It needs to be vast to put a dent in the fifty gigatonnes of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere every year. A gigatonne is a billion tonnes: the amount of carbon Auckland's mega-farm aims to capture annually. The project is currently road-testing its technology in the Caribbean and Mexico, and is inspired by the ideas of Prof Victor Smetacek, a marine biologist. Described by Seafields as their Scientific Founder, he has long been fascinated by the potential to grow seaweed in enormous rotating ocean currents known as gyres.  \"They collect all kinds of stuff in the middle,\" he says. \"The best known examples, of course, are the plastic garbage that is accumulating in the middle of the subtropical gyres.\"  In the same way these giant eddies trap islands of floating plastics, Seafields plans to hem in its crop of sargassum.  \"The gyre just stops the sargassum from escaping,\" explains John Auckland. \"As long as we create the right conditions for it, it will only grow there. If any escapes from our farm, it will just die off or just fail to continue growing.\" He had better be right. Sargassum has plagued the Caribbean's tourism industry for decades. When it washes up on the coast, its rot gives off a foul stench. Not the best setting for relaxing on a beach towel.  But Seafields is confident this will not happen with their seaweed. It says any that escapes from the farm should be starved the nutrients the team plans to syphon up from the ocean depths to feed their crop.  Because of evaporation from the subtropical sun beating down on it all day, the surface water trapped in gyres is very salty and low in nutrients. It is why Prof Smetacek calls gyres \"the oceans' deserts\".  Yet, as these deserts slowly turn, they glide over a colder, nutrient rich ocean layer that the professor wants to draw to the surface to sustain the sargassum.  \"If you were to connect the nutrient rich, deep water with pipes,\" explains Prof Smetacek, \"bring that water up from the bottom and let it warm up, then it will flow up by itself and continue flowing forever.\" The team is testing their technology in early 2023. It will be a nail-biter. While first theorised back in 1956, the salt fountain has successfully been recreated, but nowhere near the enormous scale Seafields plans. If the salt fountain does work to scale, Prof Smetacek predicts a bumper crop of sargassum.  \"They have enormous growth rates. They double their biomass every 10 days,\" he says. \"The good thing about seaweed is that you can harvest it with a combine harvester.\" Prof Smetacek envisages floating harvesters will bale the crop up and then send it down to the inert depths of the sea floor, where there is so little oxygen the bales will not rot. The carbon they contain will remain fixed in the seaweed's structure. Tests are ongoing, but the team envisages they can sequester captured carbon for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.  Seafields' financial backers hope sargassum will float money their way too. They plan to sell credits for captured carbon on the world's carbon markets. These credits allow businesses like airlines that cannot easily cut their emissions, to buy up carbon reductions made elsewhere. Carbon market critics complain the onward rush to monetise CO2 capture has led to backers overselling technologies that eventually fall short of their stated aims. Which begs the question: will Seafields' promising plan in the laboratory actually work when released into the wild?  Dr Nem Vaughan, associate professor in climate change at the University of East Anglia says: \"I'm a boring scientist, [I'd want] more data, more research, before I'd wholeheartedly say that you're going to get that kind of gigatonne-scale removal happening.\"  Dr Vaughan is also worried about a scheme that itself could have profound impacts on biological systems. Can Seafields contain so much potentially damaging seaweed out in the South Atlantic? Is the salt fountain robust enough to weather all conditions? \"People wouldn't be very happy,\" she says, \"if tonnes of plastic tubes got set adrift by a big Atlantic storm like we've just had\". She says there are less technologically challenging ways of giving nature a nudge, such as growing more trees and hedgerows and protecting habitats such as peatlands that naturally hold carbon. But, first and foremost, she says: \"We need to not stick it [CO2] up there. Just leave the fossil fuels in the ground, team. It's an awful lot easier to just leave it in the ground than it is to try and capture it once it's out.\" John Auckland concedes some elements of the process aren't yet proven, but believes it's worth the gamble. \"I see far more risky things on a daily basis that investors are willing to put their money into,\" he says.  \"We can actually make significant gains in solving the climate crisis. You can't not take this risk, because if everyone thought that way, no-one would be working on solutions of this scale.\" Chinese ex-leader Hu Jintao escorted out of congress Sunak ahead in UK PM race but Johnson camp confident 'Massive' Russian strikes hit Ukraine energy grid How the first report from Belsen shocked the world.

{"id":null,"body":"The humble potato may struggle to grow in the UK in years to come due to climate change, researchers have warned. Scotland's fields grow a quarter of Britain's potato crop. However household favourites such as Ayrshire and Maris Piper are said to be at risk as temperatures rise. The James Hutton Institute (JHI) at Invergowrie, just outside Dundee, is now trying to find varieties that will grow in warmer conditions. The annual retail value of potato products across the UK is put at more than \u00a32bn. Prof Lesley Torrance, the JHI research organisation's executive director of science, warned that climate change posed an \"existential threat\" to the potato industry. She said there was a need to quickly develop new varieties that can cope with rising temperatures. The institute is using an experimental farm to study how crops grow, and has a large collection of potato species from around the world. Prof Torrance told BBC Scotland's Landward that climate change was a major problem. \"Potatoes are a cool-climate crop,\" she said. \"And of course climate change predictions are that we're going to have hotter and drier summers. So that's a big problem.\" Crop simulation research by the institute has modelled what are called plant heat stress days. This is when temperatures reach above 25C, making crops such as potatoes change their purpose from growing to instead combating stress from heat and reducing yields. \"By 2030 there will be maybe as many as 60 heat stress days in the growing season,\" Prof Torrance explained. \"That's two months, and so that will have major impacts, mostly in the south and east of England, but Scotland is also impacted.\" Among varieties being analysed are those from the Andes mountains in South America - regarded as the origin of potato cultivation. \"We are using this collection to mine for traits that will help us with things like the heat tolerance, drought tolerance, pest and disease resistance,\" Prof Torrance said. \"The answer is that we can breed new varieties but we need to do that quite quickly. We want new varieties that can adapt to the warmer climate. \"We need to develop new varieties in time for the huge problems coming along the line with hotter weather and droughts which pose an existential threat to the industry.\" The interview with Prof Lesley Torrance by Cammy Wilson of Landward can be seen on BBC Scotland on Thursday at 20:30.

{"id":null,"body":"Glaciers across the globe - including the last ones in Africa - will be unavoidably lost by 2050 due to climate change, the UN says in a report. Glaciers in a third of UN World Heritage sites will melt within three decades, a UNESCO report found. Mount Kilimanjaro's last glaciers will vanish as will glaciers in the Alps and Yosemite National Park in the US. They will melt regardless of the world's actions to combat climate change, the authors say. The report, which makes projections based on satellite data, comes as world leaders prepare to meet in Egypt for next week's COP27 climate change conference. About 18,600 glaciers have been identified across 50 UN World Heritage sites. They represent almost 10% of the Earth's glacierised area and include renowned tourist spots and places sacred to local populations. The retreat and disappearance of glaciers was \"among the most dramatic evidence that Earth's climate is warming\", the report said. \"We hope we might be wrong, but this is the hard science,\" said UNESCO project officer Tales Carvalho Resende, one of the authors. \"Glaciers are one of the valuable indicators of climate change, because they're visible. This is something we can really see happening.\" The remaining glaciers in the other two thirds of UN World Heritage sites could be saved, but only if the world limits global warming to 1.5C, the authors say. Another UN report last week found that the world currently had \" no credible pathway \" to achieve that. The projections build upon a  previous report which used models to compute how World Heritage site glaciers would change over time. \"What is quite unprecedented in the historical record is how quickly this is happening,\" said Beata Csatho, a glaciologist from the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research. \"In the middle of the 1900s, glaciers were quite stable,\" she said. \"Then there is this incredibly fast retreat.\" World Heritage sites listed as having glaciers that will disappear by 2050 are: The report said that ice loss in World Heritage sites may have caused up to 4.5% of the observed global sea level rise between 2000 and 2020. These glaciers lose 58 billion tonnes of ice every year - equivalent to the total annual volume of water used in France and Spain put together. Many people also depend on glaciers as their water source for domestic use and agriculture, and their loss could lead to a scarcity of fresh water during the dry seasons, said Prof Duncan Quincey, a glaciology expert at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research. \"That leads to food security issues because they were using that water to irrigate their crops,\" said Quincey. Local communities and indigenous people will bear the brunt of the flooding caused by glacier loss, say the report's authors, urging that early-warning and risk-reduction disaster systems be put in place. However the most obvious thing we need to do is limit global warming. \"There's a message of hope here,\" said Carvalho Resende. \"If we can manage to drastically cut emissions, we will be able to save most of these glaciers.\" \"This is really a call to take action at every level - not only at the political level, but at our level as human beings.\" Vanishing glaciers threaten Europe's water supply World's glaciers melting at a faster pace At the front line of Ukraine's struggle for Kherson Itaewon crush: 'My country won't protect me' India jackpot winner's journey from delight to dread What Trump is hoping for on election night Why we know so little about the battle for Kherson.

{"id":null,"body":"There is \"no credible pathway\" to keep the rise in global temperatures below the key threshold of 1.5C, according to a bleak new UN assessment. Scientists believe that going beyond 1.5C would see dangerous impacts for people all over the world. The report says that since COP26 last year, governments carbon cutting plans have been \"woefully inadequate\". Only an urgent transformation of society will avoid disaster, the study says. There's just over a week until the next major climate conference, known as COP27, starts in Egypt. Mindful of the fact that the world's attention has been elsewhere since climate diplomats met in Glasgow last year, this week has seen a flurry of reports underlining the fact that climate change hasn't gone away. Answering questions from BBC viewers and listeners this week, the UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the world needed to re-focus on climate change or face catastrophe . This gloomy mood among scientists and diplomats is underlined in today's release of the UN emissions gap study . Now in its thirteenth year, the report analyses the gap between the rhetoric and the reality. It concludes that the 1.5C threshold is now in serious peril. This analysis finds that new efforts to cut carbon would see global emissions fall by less than 1% by 2030, when according to scientists, reductions of 45% are needed to keep 1.5C in play. Looking at the impact on temperatures, the study finds that with the current policies in place, the world will warm by around 2.8C this century. If countries get financial support and put into practice the plans they have made, this can be limited to 2.4C. \"We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over,\" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, who produced the study. \"Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster,\" she said. The UN acknowledges that achieving massive cuts in emissions is now a tall order. But it points to electricity, industry, transport and buildings as areas where rapid transformations away from fossil fuels can be made. \"We've got to take climate change with us wherever we go,\" said Ms Andersen. \"Into the classrooms, into the boardrooms, into the voting booth, over the dinner table. We cannot let go of climate change.\" As well as highlighting the slow pace of progress on tackling the causes of warming, other studies published this week show that governments are failing to prepare for the impacts of higher temperatures. In the UK, a committee of MPs and peers says the government needs to \"get a grip\" on the risk to critical infrastructure posed by a warming climate. The report of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy cites examples where severe weather has overwhelmed transport and communications. These include the deaths of three people from a train derailment in Scotland after heavy rainfall in August 2020, and the loss of electric power by almost 1m people during Storm Arwen in November 2021. \"The thing I find most disturbing is the lack of evidence that anyone in government is focusing on how all the impacts can come together, creating cascading crises,\" said the chair of the Joint Committee, Dame Margaret Beckett MP. \"There are simply no ministers with focused responsibility for making sure that our infrastructure is resilient to extreme weather and other effects of climate change.\" While almost all the reports published this week underline the lack of progress on climate, there are some strong positives amidst the gloom. The State of Climate Action study says that in transport, a transition to sustainable travel is well underway. Globally, almost half of the buses sold in 2021 were powered by battery electric or fuel cell electric engines. In passenger car sales, electric vehicles have doubled from the previous year to now account for almost 9% of new cars. This note of hope is also reflected in the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook , also published today. It argues that the energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine is causing changes that have the potential to hasten the transition to a more secure and sustainable energy system. The report also finds that a raft of new policies in countries like the US, Japan, Korea and the EU will likely see clean energy investments of around $2 trillion by 2030, a rise of more than 50% from today.

{"id":null,"body":"Climate change is severely impacting people's health around the world, a report by a leading medical publication has found. The Lancet Countdown report says the world's continued reliance on fossil fuels increases the risk of food insecurity, infectious disease and heat-related illness. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres responded that global leaders must match action to the size of the problem. Leaders will meet for the major climate conference COP27 in Egypt next month. The report includes the work of 99 experts from organisations including the World Health Organization (WHO) and led by University College London. It describes how extreme weather has increased pressure on health services globally already grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic. Heat-related deaths globally have increased by two thirds over the last two decades, it finds. Temperature records have been broken around the world in 2022, including in the UK where 40C was recorded in July, as well as parts of Europe, Pakistan and China. The health impacts of extreme heat include exacerbating conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and causing heat stroke and poor mental health. But it said there are solutions. \"Despite the challenges, there is clear evidence that immediate action could still save the lives of millions, with a rapid shift to clean energy and energy efficiency,\" the report concludes. Mr Guterres said that the world is watching G20 countries, which produce 80% of global greenhouse emissions. They must step up efforts to slash emissions and lead the way by investing more in renewable energy, he added. \"Human health, livelihoods, household budgets and national economies are being pummelled, as the fossil fuel addiction spirals out of control,\" he said. Today's Lancet report is a call to arms.  The authors hope the evidence it presents shows the need for urgent action at the UN conference on climate in Egypt. But the summit faces strong headwinds. Developing countries will be demanding nations which grew rich using fossil fuels cough up more cash to meet the costs of the loss and damage our changing climate is causing. And what about the $100bn a year for climate action developed countries were supposed have made available from 2020, they will ask? We are still billions of dollars short of the total. The Egyptians hosts of COP27 have warned of a \"crisis of trust\". But the developed world is battling with a cost-of-living crisis as energy and food prices soar. Many of them are already spending billions on military support for Ukraine. Get ready for some heated debates in Egypt. A Unicef report, also published on Wednesday, warned urgent action is needed to increase funding to protect children and vulnerable communities from worsening heatwaves. Researchers found that the change in climate has increased the spread of infectious diseases. The number of months that facilitate malaria transmission increased in the highland areas of the Americas and Africa in the past 60 years. Fossil fuel emissions are major contributors to air pollution. Data from the Lancet Countdown estimates that exposure to air pollution contributed to 4.7 million deaths globally in 2020, of which 1.3 million (35%) directly related to fossil fuel combustion. The impacts of climate change are also rapidly aggravating and worsening the effects of other coexisting crises such as food insecurity, energy poverty and increased air pollution, it says.

UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has confirmed he will attend, having previously said he would not. UN climate summits are held every year, for governments to agree steps to limit global temperature rises. They are referred to as COPs, which stands for \"Conference of the Parties\". The parties are the attending countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. COP27 is the 27th annual UN meeting on climate. It will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh from 6 to 18 November . The world is warming because of emissions produced by humans, mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. Global temperatures have risen 1.1C and are heading towards 1.5C, according to the UN's climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If temperatures rise 1.7 to 1.8C above 1850s levels, the IPCC estimates that half the word's population could be exposed to life-threatening heat and humidity. To prevent this, 194 countries signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. More than 200 governments have been invited. Having previously announced he would not go, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that he would attend the summit , \"to deliver on [COP26's] legacy of building a secure and sustainable future\". Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also going , but King Charles will not be there, following government advice. However, he is holding a pre-conference reception at Buckingham Palace . Vladimir Putin is not due to go, although Russian delegates are still expected to take part. Other countries, including China, have not confirmed whether their leaders will attend. Hosts Egypt called on countries to put their differences aside and \"show leadership\" on the issue of climate change. Environmental charities, community groups, think tanks, businesses and faith groups will also take part. This will be the fifth time a COP has been hosted in Africa. The region's governments hope it will draw attention to the severe impacts of climate change on the continent. The IPCC says Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world. Currently, 20 million people are estimated to be facing food insecurity in east Africa because of drought. However, choosing Egypt as the venue has attracted controversy. Some human rights and climate campaigners say the government has stopped them attending because they have criticised its rights record. Ahead of the meeting, countries were asked to submit ambitious national climate plans. Only 25 have done so to date. COP27 will focus on three main areas: Some areas not fully resolved or covered at COP26 will be picked up: There will also be themed days on issues including gender, agriculture and biodiversity. Finance has been long been an issue at climate talks. In 2009, developed countries committed to give $100bn (\u00a387bn) a year, by 2020, to developing countries to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. The target was missed and moved back to 2023. But developing nations are also calling for payments for \"loss and damage\" - the impacts faced now. An option for making such payments was excluded from the Bonn climate talks , after pushback from wealthier nations who feared they would be forced to pay compensation for decades. But the EU agreed that discussions should take place at COP27. It depends who you ask. Developing countries, as a minimum, will want loss and damage finance to be an agenda item. They will also be pushing to have a date set for when they might start to receive payments. Developed nations will be looking for more commitment from large developing countries - such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa - to move away from coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. There are also pledges from last year's meeting - on forests, coal, and methane - that more countries may support. However, some scientists believe world leaders have left it too late and no matter what is agreed at COP27, 1.5C will not be achieved.

{"id":null,"body":"How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office\u2019s most recent major climate modelling data.

Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact, reached at the COP26 summit in 2021 , agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.

If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}.\r\n           The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a \"summer day\". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summer currently ranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England. But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and the world warms by 2C , the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures. In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperatures rise by 4C , summers will be even hotter. Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last \u2013 but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often.

If global average temperatures rise by 2C, this could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}} per month.

At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same.\r\n           As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise.

If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, when enough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness . Currently, the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a 2C rise , very little compared to what we've seen recently. But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at 2C global warming will vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were to rise by 4C , more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months.  The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. \"I think it\u2019s really frightening,\u201d says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. \u201cIt's just a wake-up call really as to what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding.\u2029 Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. And snowy UK winters could become thing of the past as climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, the UK Climate Projections (UKCP) . The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C.  Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such as\u00a0millions more people being exposed to extreme heat .\r\n     If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in the most recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found in this 2018 Met Office paper . This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be found in this 2017 paper . Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

{"id":null,"body":"The UN's climate change summit has opened in Egypt with a warning that our planet is \"sending a distress signal\". Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was responding to a UN report released on Sunday saying the past eight years were on track to be the warmest on record. More than 120 world leaders are due to arrive at the summit known as COP27, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. This will kick off two weeks of negotiations between countries on climate action. COP27 president, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, urged leaders to not let food and energy crises related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine get in the way of action on climate change. \"It is inherent on us all in Sharm el-Sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it.\" The need for action was laid bare in the latest report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization. Mr Guterres sent a video message to the conference in which he called the the State of the Global Climate Report 2022 a \"chronicle of climate chaos\". In it, scientists estimate that global temperatures have now risen by 1.15C since pre-industrial times and said the latest eight years were on track to be the warmest on record. The report also warned of the other wide-ranging impacts of climate change, including the acceleration of sea level rise, record glacier mass losses and record breaking heatwaves. Mr Guterres said that in light of these findings, COP27 must be the place for urgent and credible climate action. COP27 will really begin in earnest on Monday with a World Leaders' Summit, when heads of state and government leaders deliver five-minute addresses outlining what they want from the meeting. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to urge world leaders to move \"further and faster\" in transitioning to renewable energy. He will also tell leaders not to \"backslide\" on commitments made at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow. World leaders will speak on Monday and Tuesday, and once they depart, conference delegates get down to the business of negotiation. At last year's summit in Glasgow a number of pledges were agreed: Developing nations - which are at the forefront of climate change - are demanding that previous commitments to finance are upheld. But they also want there to be discussion on \"loss and damage\" finance - money to help them cope with the losses they are already facing from climate change rather than just to prepare for future impacts. Following intense negotiations, the issue is on the official agenda of COP27. As well as all the formal negotiations there will be hundreds of events over the two weeks with exhibitions, workshops and cultural performances from youth, business groups, indigenous societies, academia, artists and fashion communities from all over the world. Protests - which are normally a vibrant feature of COP summits - are likely to be subdued. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, in power since 2014, has overseen a widespread crackdown on dissent. Rights groups estimate the country has had as many as 60,000 political prisoners, many detained without trial. Mr Shoukry has said that space would be set aside in Sharm el-Sheikh for protests to take place. However, Egyptian activists have told the BBC that many local groups had been unable to register for the conference.

{"id":null,"body":"Last November global leaders met at the UN climate summit COP26 in Glasgow to agree next steps to tackle climate change. But climate experts have told the BBC that progress in 2022 has been slow - with governments around the world distracted by global energy and financial crises. Last week the UN warned the world is heading towards catastrophe . But there are rays of hope - including fresh US legislation and a change of government in Brazil that could reverse the Amazon rainforest's destruction. As leaders depart for COP27 in Egypt, we look at seven key players to ask who is leading the way and who is dragging their feet. Your device may not support this visualisation The US made a huge leap forward this year when it passed sweeping new laws to confront climate change. Measures within the Inflation Reduction Act could reduce US greenhouse gas emissions - those gases that warm the atmosphere - by 40% by 2030. \"This is the biggest investment in climate solutions in US history. It's a huge sign of progress,\" Dan Lashof, US director at the World Resources Institute, told BBC News. The bill aims to make green energy the default in major sectors like electricity, transport and industry. The most obvious result for consumers is a tax credit of around $7,500 (\u00a36,500) for those who buy an electric car. But it is not all good news. After a senior US politician controversially visited Taiwan, China ended its co-operation with the US on climate - which could seriously affect international climate negotiations. And in response to the energy crisis, President Joe Biden released 15m barrels of oil from reserves on to the market and approved new leases for oil and gas drilling. The US has also not delivered its fair share of finance to support developing countries suffering the most from climate change, which could damage relations at COP27. The UK hosted COP26, secured major global pledges, and showed itself to be a clear international climate leader. But the UK is going to COP27 \"weaker\" with \"disappointing\" leadership, says Alyssa Gilbert, Director of Policy at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute. On Wednesday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak performed a U-turn from his earlier decision not go to to Egypt due to other priorities - experts say this has compromised the UK. \"One of the key things about COP is political leadership from the top. Dithering from the Prime Minister is worse in a year when we are the presidents of COP,\" explains Ms Gilbert. And the UK has not increased its ambition to tackle its role in climate change, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker of plans submitted to the UN. (These are called Nationally Determined Contributions - part of the landmark Paris Agreement in which countries promised to regularly increase ambition to tackle climate change). The global energy crisis also led the UK to back-track on commitments to end new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and close down coal-powered stations. These changes may not fundamentally alter the UK's energy balance - but they \"send the wrong signal\", explains Robert Falkner, professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics. The European Union is historically progressive on tackling climate change, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on energy supplies to Europe have undermined that. \"Leaders extended the lifeline of coal-fired power plants and and we estimate that European emissions actually increased by about 2% in the first six months of this year,\" says Prof Robert Falkner. Climate Action Tracker now rates EU's climate targets, policies, and finance as \"insufficient\", and the EU has not updated the UN with new NDC plans. But Prof Falkner considers the return to investing in fossil fuels a \"temporary setback\" and suggests the EU could take this opportunity to make itself energy secure by investing in renewables. A new plan, the REPowerEU plan, aims to increase the EU's share of renewable energy in 2030 from 40% to 45%. India is one of the few countries to have published updated climate targets in 2022. \"It is almost impossible to talk about India without talking about progress,\" says Kamya Choudhary at London School of Economics. It promises to reduce emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 - meaning it plans to reduce emissions per dollar. It also wants 50% of installed energy to be renewable. But India's plan to reopen 100 coal mines (coal is the most polluting fossil fuel) could be a barrier to those ambitions. Professor Navroz Dubash at Centre for Public Policy and UN climate advisor told the BBC that tariffs on coal are helping to pay for key infrastructure, and the loss of that income needs to be plugged. However, as in other countries, Kamya Choudhary suggests this is a short-term measure to cope with the energy crisis. Climate Action Tracker says India's pledges are not very ambitious - they could be achieved with limited government action. Brazil holds one of the keys to fighting climate change - its massive Amazon rainforest, the lungs of the planet, soaks up huge amounts of carbon. In a dramatic election last week, President Jair Bolsonaro was ousted by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva - potentially changing overnight the future of the Amazon. \"Brazil is ready to retake its leadership in the fight against the climate crisis,\" Lula said on Sunday. In 2021 alone deforestation increased by 48% . Renata Piazzon, executive director at Instituto Arapyau, puts this down to President Bolsonaro championing more mining in the Amazon. Since Glasgow, Brazil's targets have been criticised as \"less ambitious\" than pledges made in 2016, and for failing to meet promises. Historically, Brazil has used hydropower to provide large amounts of green energy - but a drought in 2021 drained its dams. In response, it invested in oil and gas - with predictions that its use of oil will increase by 70% by 2030. However, the International Energy Agency predicts that solar will compensate for the loss of the nation's hydropower. Politics has seen a change of face in Australia too. Elected in May, new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has accelerated climate plans, ending a decade of backsliding. The country submitted new targets to the UN , promising to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 - a big leap forward from its previous target of 26%. But Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, says it only seems like significant progress because of how far behind Australia was. \"There has been so far been little change in policy and certainly not in the area of fossil fuels,\" he said. Australia's states have led the way in increasing renewable energy - but the country remains in the top five producers of coal in the world. And although Australia promised at COP26 to end deforestation, it was classed in 2021 as the only developed country that is a \"hotspot\" for tree loss - nearly half of forests in eastern Australia have been destroyed. China has a complicated role in global climate action. Unlike countries in the developed world, it is not responsible for historical greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say have caused climate change so far. But it is now a \"terrific polluter\" because of its very rapid economic growth, explains Neil Hurst, senior policy fellow for energy and mitigation at the Grantham Institute. It burns half of the coal in the world, and is reluctant to cut back because of energy shortages. However, China is also by far the biggest investors in renewable energy. A quarter of newly-registered cars in China are electric. \"They're making big efforts and setting demanding targets, including peaking its carbon emissions by 2030,\" explains Mr Hurst. And it has big ambitions to address carbon emissions with tree planting. In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to plant 70 billion trees by 2030. Additional reporting by Data Journalism team.

{"id":null,"body":"When COP26 was held a year ago in Glasgow, Northern Ireland was the only part of host nation the UK that did not have climate change legislation in place.  Now, as world leaders gather in Sharm El-Sheikh for COP27 , what has changed for Northern Ireland, and where is it on its journey to net zero?  The big change, of course, is that climate legislation is now in place in Northern Ireland.  After an unprecedented two-bill race, Climate Change (No.2) Bill gained Royal Assent in June 2022.  It set a goal of reaching net zero by 2050, creating legal obligations to reduce emissions.  But the former Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots secured an amendment to his own bill that limited the required reduction in methane to no more than 46%.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is mostly produced through agricultural activities.  Critics say that puts additional pressure on other sectors to make up the difference.  Northern Ireland's first Climate Action Plan coming from the bill is due to be published at the end of December 2023.  It will contain targets for reductions in each of the highest emitting sectors.  The latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs shows agriculture to be the largest emitting sector in Northern Ireland, contributing 27% of emissions and showing an increase over the 30-year period covered by the statistical bulletin.  Farmers say improving the efficiency of producing food is key to reducing their emissions.  And while they welcomed the limit on the required reduction in methane, the president of the Ulster Farmers' Union says he is under no illusions about the targets agriculture will be asked to meet.  \"They will be challenging for agriculture,\" David Brown said.  \"That's why our farmers are looking at obviously carbon audits and so forth, because the retailers are saying we need to be able to provide evidence that we're moving in a direction that is reducing that carbon footprint.  \"There needs to be a focus on maintaining food production as well, as part of that moving forward and mitigating against the worst effects of climate change.\" Transport is the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases in Northern Ireland, according to the Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  It accounts for 16% of emissions, a proportion which has gone down by 2% from 1990 to 2020.  At COP26 in Glasgow, the public transport operator Translink announced it was buying more zero emission vehicles as part of its drive to make its fleet net zero emissions by 2040.  A new transport hub is being built in Belfast which the operator hopes will encourage more people to swap their cars for the bus or train.  \"What we're doing at Translink is continuing what we announced at COP26,\" said chief executive, Chris Conway.  \"We've made great strides, but there's still a lot to do.  \"We are working on the feasibility for electrification of our railway. But also modal shift - how do we get more people using public transport? \"Obviously things like the cost-of-living crisis, Covid, the Ukraine War - all these things are dominating the news at the minute, but really, this [climate crisis] still is the largest crisis we face in the long-term, and we're very focussed on making sure we address sustainable transport.\" In private transport, electric vehicles are still a tiny proportion of the market - 0.8%, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nine of the 11 councils in Northern Ireland formed a consortium and successfully secured funding from the Office of Zero Emission Vehicles for installing charging points in residential areas where private off-street charging is not available.  Almost half (47%) of Northern Ireland's electricity comes from renewable sources - predominantly wind.  But although emissions from making energy have almost halved in the past three decades, the sector still contributes 14% of Northern Ireland's greenhouse gases.  And world events have focussed attention on the need to be self-sufficient in power generation.  That worries the chief executive of Action Renewables, a charity which promotes renewable energy projects.  \"We're seeing a lot more interest in renewable energy because of the current climate,\" said Terry Waugh Action Renewables. \"So you've got the gas crisis, you've got the cost-of-living crisis, you've got the issue with Ukraine.  \"When they're resolved, we would worry that that emphasis that we're got at the minute might back off a little bit.  \"So we need to keep climate change front and centre of why we're doing this.\"  At COP26 Edwin Poots announced a consultation on Northern Ireland's first ever Environment Strategy.  It is one of the four main strategies underpinning the Green Growth Strategy, which makes the environment and sustainability a basis for economic growth.  It is also intended to be adopted as the first \"Environmental Improvement Plan\", hopefully by July 2023.  An energy strategy was also launched by the Department for the Economy - \"Pathway to Net Zero\".  It set out the ambition to decarbonise energy in Northern Ireland and an annual action plan was also published. And if you think that sounds like a lot of strategies, you are not alone.  \"We have a lot of policies and papers that have the word 'green' attached to the end of them,\" said Daithi McKay, chairman of the Climate Coalition.  \"They mean nothing unless they're implemented and we see real emissions reductions.  \"Reports that come out year on year show that emissions reductions aren't happening fast enough.  \"So we can have all the policies we want, but unless we have those emissions going down radically, then they mean nothing.\" A really simple guide to climate change King Charles hosts climate meeting at palace Northern Ireland's first climate change laws approved War not over, officials warn as Ukraine celebrates Race for Nevada neck-and-neck in fight for US Senate Ukraine forces receive rapturous welcome in Kherson.

{"id":null,"body":"Global leaders are about to meet for another UN climate summit - COP27 starting in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday - and the reality of climate change for many people can be overwhelming. Record-breaking heatwaves, devastating floods in Pakistan, and drought in East Africa - and that is just this year. It is no surprise that climate anxiety is rising, particularly among young people, who have mostly only known a world affected by climate change. But experts and activists have told BBC News that these fears can actually be good news for the planet. \"People who are really aware of climate change may be more motivated to take action,\" University of Bath environmental psychologist Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh says. Her research has found a link between climate concerns and taking effective action, including reducing carbon footprint by cutting down on waste or buying second-hand. When people talk about their own climate anxiety, they often say it is linked to the vast amounts of negative and often scary news about the planet. \"I think it's hard not to worry about climate change. We're constantly bombarded with news articles and social media about how it's just crisis after crisis - ice caps melting, disasters - it can be very overwhelming,\" explains Roisin, 16, from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Roisin is on the youth advisory board of Save The Children, which recently found that 70% of children in the UK worried about the world they are inheriting. But she says there is hope too: \"You can always see young activists like Greta Thunberg, and people like David Attenborough taking action on it.\" Roisin says she has become a vegetarian and makes sure she only shops locally. \"Taking action is my only way of dealing with climate anxiety - it means I know I've done everything I can do to solve the problem,\" she says. Some campaigners, like 23-year-old Zahra Biabani in California, say the widespread focus on climate catastrophe can be misleading. When she began posting online about environmental issues at university, she realised there was \"a gap between education and action, which was being filled by 'doomism'\". \"Climate education can be debilitating without a form of encouragement to act, especially when we see what's going on the world, and how it's going to get worse,\" she explains.  A post shared by Zahra Biabani - Conscious Entrepreneurship (@zahranurbiabani) Now she shares \"climate optimist\" news and writes newsletters focusing on good news and solutions. \"Climate optimism is not just nice, it's necessary because in order to be sustained in our action and our advocacy, we need to believe in and have something that's worth fighting for,\" she explains. She believes that there is a generational divide between many young people who want to focus on how the planet could be saved, and the \"older white man community\" that focuses on how \"the world is going to end\". \"I don't want to think this comes from a bad place. I think they have a lot of anxiety as well, but they're finding a very different way to use it,\" she suggests. Psychotherapist Caroline Hickman specialises in climate anxiety, and has treated a significant number of young people. She says it is \"totally normal\" to worry about the state of the planet, but \"sinking into despair and 'climate doomism' is not the solution\". It is important to distinguish between serious clinical anxiety about climate change, which is a mental health issue, and worries or concerns. Prof Whitmarsh suggests that while there are high levels of concern about climate change, particularly in young people, most people do not have debilitating climate anxiety that requires treatment by a mental health professional.

{"id":null,"body":"For the past two years, Nikhil Arora has been working hard to cut his organic gardening company's carbon footprint, taking small steps, like shifting away from plastic packaging, to make his business, Back to the Roots, the most environmentally efficient it has ever been. The California-based company is small, employing just 21 people, but it expects to make roughly $100m (\u00a384m) in sales this year . Mr Arora says the moves it has made are critical to the fight against climate change. \"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the US economy. We power most of the jobs, most of the growth and, therefore, I think we will also power most of the change,\" says Mr Arora, co-founder of the company, which started selling organic gardening kits more than a decade ago. Corporate giants such as Amazon and Walmart have faced much of the public pressure over sustainability goals. But a company's supply chain produces 11 times more emissions than the company on its own, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a non-profit charity that runs the global emissions disclosure system, has found. In industries like retail, it found that supply chains produce 25 times more emissions than the company itself. \"You can't solve the climate problem without addressing small businesses,\" says Michael Vandenbergh, law professor at Vanderbilt University and director of its Climate Change Research Network. \"They make up a very large share of the carbon emissions associated with big companies' supply chains... so you can't get to any meaningful change without dealing with small businesses.\" Small businesses make up 99% of US companies and employ nearly half of the American workforce. But their sheer numbers make it easy for them to fly under the radar and mean they're tough to regulate. Advocates say focusing on supply chains can make it easier to engage with small businesses, unlocking billions in emissions savings. \"For an individual company, their relative impact is not high,\" says Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains for the CDP's North America branch. \"But when you think about the collection of tens, hundreds and millions of small enterprises that are suppliers to these large corporations, they're incredibly important. \"So global value chains are one of the most effective tools driving impact.\" If it's true to say the US is the engine of the world economy, then small and medium-sized businesses are the fuel that drives that engine. Small businesses create nearly two-thirds of new jobs in the workforce and account for 44% of US economic activity. So what's the secret to their success? What challenges do they face and which are the best cities and regions for them to thrive? Read more from our Small Business USA series As the climate crisis worsens and larger companies look for the most efficient ways to reduce their environmental impact, cutting a company's \"Scope 3\" emissions - or emissions from the supply chain - has gained traction with big companies. At COP 27 in Egypt, the UN's annual climate summit, more than a dozen of the world's largest food firms said they planned to end deforestation in their supply chains by 2025, making collaboration with smaller suppliers key to accelerating climate action. US retail corporation Walmart attributes 95% of its emissions to its supply chain, which includes thousands of small suppliers. \"From day one, working with small businesses was key,\" says Jane Ewing, senior vice president for sustainability at Walmart. \"We feel we can play a really important role in saying, 'Hey, here's some tools,' and then we help guide them along that journey. We've seen more [small businesses] lean in than ever before.\" In 2017, Walmart launched Project Gigaton, which aims to use its might to help small firms in its supplier network track their carbon footprint, set sustainability goals, and access more favourable loan terms. Mr Arora's Back to the Roots joined the programme in 2019, along with 2,400 other businesses, in the hope of lowering its emissions. Mr Arora, who counts Walmart as his biggest client, credits the retailer with helping his business find, solve and track its main sources of carbon emissions, pushing it towards its goals. \"This is by far the most efficient we've been in terms of carbon emissions. We've been able to scale this company at an exciting pace while also not increasing our environmental footprint,\" he says. Walmart says the success at Back to the Roots has been replicated across its network, helping to reduce greenhouse gases by 574 million tonnes since 2017. That has put it halfway towards its goal of cutting emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030 - an impact equivalent to Germany going carbon neutral for a year. Walmart is not alone in taking action. Overall, CDP has found that roughly 200 major corporations have leaned on their suppliers to reduce their carbon footprints, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.8 billion tonnes last year alone. But for many small companies, being sustainable is a luxury. In a recent survey by the SME Climate Hub, a platform that works with small and medium enterprises to cut their emissions, two-thirds of small business owners said they were concerned they would not be able to reduce their carbon footprint, citing knowledge, funding and time. About 70% said they would need access to external funds to reduce their emissions. The economic climate does not favour small businesses either, says Pamela Jouven, director of the SME Climate Hub, often making sustainability their last priority. \"They're having to face this perfect storm of rising energy prices, inflation and supply chain disruption. So the very first challenge for these small businesses is how to survive. It's hard for them to make the time to add another project to the list,\" she says. At the Carbon Disclosure Project, Simon Fischweicher is staying optimistic. One day he hopes that supply chain decarbonisation will become so commonplace and accessible that even small businesses will start looking at how they can reduce their own value chain's carbon footprint. \"When we'll start to see [supply chain decarbonisation] be adopted by smaller companies, that's when we know we're going beyond that first tier of impact, and we'll start to see real change happen.\" Covid protests in Chinese city after deadly fire Landslide tears through homes on Italian island Russian atrocities bring Nato closer than ever Tutankhamun's inspiring 21st Century afterlife Using artificial intelligence to spot breast cancer.

{"id":null,"body":"Brazil is back, president-elect Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has told rapturous crowds at the UN climate summit COP27 in Egypt. Walking into a room of supporters singing his name, Lula promised to restore the Amazon rainforest and chase down climate criminals. Huge numbers gathered to see him speak, making him one of the superstars of this summit. Nations are meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss tackling climate change.  Just two weeks after his narrow election win, Lula is making his first appearance on the international stage, meeting leaders including from the US, China and the EU at the climate conference. \"We must stop this rush to the abyss. There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,\" he said, saying climate change would have the highest priority for his government. \"We will do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and the degradation of our biomes.\" While there is no doubt Brazil's president is full of ambition when it comes to tackling climate change, analysts say the challenge will be to make these promises come true. Brazil is deeply divided over Lula's return to power and his job to unite the country won't be easy. The president told the summit that Brazil would prove that it was possible to generate wealth without destroying the environment, saying it was impossible to separate tackling global warming from poverty. Striking a harder tone, he said Brazil would ensure that developing nations got the money they are owed to deal with the effects of climate change. He also pledged to protect indigenous people, whose land has been targeted under current President Jair Bolsonaro. Indigenous people in traditional dress stood up cheering and shaking maracas. But Lula faces an uphill battle at home in Brazil where he faces significant opposition in Congress and a divided society. Under Mr Bolsonaro, who will hand over power to Lula in January, deforestation of the Amazon reached record highs. Puyr Temb\u00e9, an indigenous leader from heavily deforested Par\u00e1 state, told BBC News that Mr Bolsonaro completely dismantled laws protecting the Amazon. On Tuesday US climate envoy John Kerry said he was confident Lula would bring a complete turnaround on Brazil's approach to the environment. Former environment minister in Brazil Isabella Teixeira told BBC News that \"the world\" is now \"embracing Brazil at COP27\". Reflecting the challenges at home, Lula told the summit there was just one Brazil and he would govern for all. In order to make progress on his agenda, Ms Teixeira said Lula would need to convince people and Congress members to agree, not disagree with each other.  Lula must reverse Mr Bolsonaro's legacy by rebuilding the environmental protection agencies, unfreezing the Amazon Fund which promotes conservation, and tackling criminals in the Amazon, according to Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of Brazil's Climate Observatory network. He says that civil society will not hesitate to challenge the new government it if fails to keep its promises. \"When the government is succeeding, we will support them, but if it fails, we will criticise them.\" But Brazil and the world must be prepared for \"mistakes and failures\", suggests Roberto Waack, a business leader and chair of Arapya\u00fa Institute.  \"Climate a complicated problem, Lula has ambitious pledges and we will face disappointments because of the political situation in Brazil,\" he said. \"You can't just say stop deforestation and the next day the problem is solved,\" he said. On Tuesday, young Brazilian activists at COP27 met Lula. \"It was hugely emotional, I cried a lot. It is unbelievable to feel part of Brazil again,\" Gabrielle Alves, an environmental racism researcher who is part of the Clima de Mudan\u00e7a coalition, told BBC News. Behind the scenes, negotiations between nations are ongoing at COP27 with a final agreement expected on Friday or Saturday. However there are still wide divisions between countries on key issues. The question of who will pay the bill for irreversible climate damage remains hotly debated, as developing countries want finance urgently earmarked to cover their losses. But developed nations are resisting any question of compensation from countries who historically caused the majority of emissions. There is concern too that the crucial aim to limiting temperature rise to 1.5C - which scientists say is crucial to avoiding the worst effects of climate change - is in jeopardy.

{"id":null,"body":"Vast amounts of bacteria could be released as the world's glaciers melt due to climate change, scientists have warned. Potentially harmful pathogens are among the thousands of microbes that could leak into rivers and lakes. Researchers at Aberystwyth University said their study highlighted the need to act quickly to curb global warming. They studied meltwater from eight glaciers across Europe and North America and two sites in Greenland. Glaciers are huge bodies of slowly moving ice that have formed over hundreds or thousands of years. As the planet heats up, they are melting at a worrying rate - causing sea levels to rise. The team at Aberystwyth University estimated the situation could result in more than a 100,000 tonnes of microbes, such as bacteria, being released into the environment over the next 80 years - a number comparable to all the cells in every human body on earth. Microbiologist Dr Arwyn Edwards said the study showed clearly for the first time the \"vast scale\" of micro-organisms living on the surface or locked inside Earth's glaciers. \"The number of microbes released depends closely on how quickly the glaciers melt, and therefore how much we continue to warm the planet,\" he said. The team's calculations are based on a \"moderate\" warming scenario, as developed by the IPCC, an international panel of climate experts. This would see global temperatures rise by between 2C and 3C on average by 2100. As the flow of microbes into rivers, lakes, fjords and seas increases, there could be \"significant\" impacts for water quality, Dr Edwards explained. But this would be followed within decades by the microbe tap being turned off, as the glaciers disappear completely. He said: \"Globally there are 200,000 catchments of note that are fed by glacial meltwater and some of these are very sensitive environments that are poorly developed in terms of organic carbon and nutrients. \"In others there's a lot of economic activity and billions of human beings whose livelihoods depend on water that ultimately comes from those glaciers. \"We think of glaciers as a huge store of frozen water but the key lesson from this research is that they are also ecosystems in their own right.\" Thousands of different micro-organisms are found growing on glaciers, or stored inside, he said, with some that may be harmful to humans. \"The risk is probably very small, but it requires careful assessment.\" Glaciologist Dr Tristram Irvine-Fynn said more research was needed: \"Over the coming decades, the forecast 'peak water' from Earth's mountain glaciers means we need to improve our understanding of the state and fate of (these) ecosystems. \"With a better grasp of that picture, we could better predict the effects of climate change on glacial surfaces and catchment biogeochemistry.\" The Aberystwyth academics' findings are published in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment this month.

{"id":null,"body":"A new funding arrangement on loss and damage - a pooled fund for countries most affected by climate change - has been hailed as a \"historic moment\". It can be seen as the most important climate advance since the Paris Agreement at COP 2015. For decades the victims of a changing climate were the ghosts the richer world just couldn't see. Money has long been available to cut carbon or help countries adapt to rising temperatures - but there was nothing for those who had lost everything. \"For someone who has seen his home disappear in the floods in Pakistan, a solar panel or a sea wall isn't much use,\" explained Harjeet Singh from the Climate Action Network. The COP27 decision on loss and damage won't fix that immediately. The fund comes with many unknowns. What will be the criteria to trigger a payout? Where will the money come from, and will it be enough? Compare the EU's \u20ac60m contribution against the $30bn costs that Pakistan faces. But establishing the loss and damage fund is about more than money or compensation or reparations - it is really about solidarity and rebuilding trust. Despite the dramatic impacts the rising temperatures will inflict on the world, this fund signals that no one will be left behind. It is a concrete demonstration that we really are all in this together.

While the loss and damage text represented a big win, the overall cover decision is being seen as a missed opportunity in the fight against climate change. The man who ran the COP26 negotiations in Glasgow put it bluntly. \"Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text,\" said Alok Sharma. \"Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text.\" As well as all these limitations there was also a sharp U-turn on the language around fossil fuels. The text now includes a reference to \"low emission and renewable energy\". This is being seen as a significant loophole that could allow for the development of further gas resources, as gas produces less emissions than coal. There's a fifty-fifty chance over the next five years that we'll go over this important marker of temperature increases, compared to pre-industrial times. We're likely to pass it permanently by 2031. But at COP27, the EU and other developed countries were willing to die on the hill of strengthening the promise to keep 1.5C alive. Their efforts were ultimately in vain as the cover text failed to include a reference to the phasing out of all fossil fuels, seen as a necessary advance on last year's decision to phase down the use of coal. \"I wish we got fossil fuel phase out,\" said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, the Climate Envoy of the Marshall Islands, who along with other island states fear annihilation if temperatures rise above 1.5C. \"The current text is not enough. But we've shown with the loss and damage fund that we can do the impossible. So we know we can come back next year and get rid of fossil fuels once and for all.\" There's a deep sense of solidarity by the richer nations with the island states on this issue of keeping below 1.5C Faith in the threshold has also become a key differential between the US, EU and other richer countries and China, which is markedly less concerned about the goal. While the world will undoubtedly be a better place the closer we stay to the 1.5C guiderail, belief in the ideal is also a political and economic bridge to the developing world. So even as the science and the COP process falter on 1.5C, expect the diplomatic attachment to grow stronger in the coming years. One key takeaway from COP27 was the presence and power of fossil fuel - be they delegates or countries. Attendees connected to the oil and gas industry were everywhere. Some 636 were part of country delegations and trade teams. The crammed pavilions felt at times like a fossil fuel trade fair. This influence was clearly reflected in the final text. Demands from India and others for all fossil fuels to be phased down didn't survive, despite the backing of the EU and many other countries rich and poor. Many African countries were also keen to use the COP as a platform to promote new oil and gas initiatives in their countries. \"The fact that the outcome only talks about 'phase-down of unabated coal power' is a disaster for Africa and for the climate,\" said Babawale Obayanju, from Friends of the Earth Africa. \"We don't need more gas extraction in Africa, devastating our communities for the benefit of rich countries and corporations. What we needed from COP27 was agreement to a rapid, equitable phase out of all fossil fuels.\" That battle will resume at COP28 in Dubai. The undoubted darling of the COP was Brazil's president-elect Luiz Ignacio Lula Da Silva. Just as he did in Copenhagen in 2009, Lula electrified the conference with his promise of zero deforestation by 2030. More than his commitment to the Amazon, Lula restored people's faith in the power of the ballot box to solve the climate problem. So too, in his un-showy way did President Biden. The retention of the Senate by the Democrats most likely ensures that his Inflation Reduction Act will not be overturned or watered down. At a stroke it puts the United States' carbon cutting goal for 2030 within reach. The affirmation that democracy is an effective weapon against climate change was also demonstrated in the actions of the host country. With security and surveillance everywhere, the conference took place in an atmosphere best described as barely restrained intolerance. As well as the ongoing troubles over human rights, the Egyptian hosts paid scant attention to basic functional needs of a conference such as food, drink and decent wifi. When push came to shove, there was a distinct lack of empathy from negotiators for the presidency. This really mattered in the final showdown. COP27 could have been a major advance against climate change. That it ultimately didn't hit that mark is at least partly down to the hosts.

{"id":null,"body":"Birdsong, snowdrops, blossom and midge bites - these are not things you associate with November in the north of England. But these are just some of the milder side effects of a warming world. As well as fuelling deadly floods and drought, rising temperatures are cited as a cause of spontaneous explosions of Siberian permafrost, mustard shortages and the planet becoming dimmer. Many of the impacts of climate change are devastating. Some are weird. Giant craters in thawing Siberian permafrost have been attributed by some Russian scientists to warmer ground temperatures causing underground pockets of gas to spontaneously explode. Permafrost is defined as land that has been frozen continuously for more than two years. It's only one hypothesis to explain the formation of giant craters in the Arctic landscape. As this BBC Future article highlighted , they are a \"disquieting sign\" that this cold, largely unpopulated landscape at the north of our planet is undergoing some radical changes. Recent research also showed that the Arctic is warming even faster than previously thought - four times faster than the rest of the world. And as well as blasting holes in Earth's wilderness, climate change could also be dimming the planet's \"shine\", according to scientists at Big Bear Solar Observatory in New Jersey. By measuring the sunlight reflected from Earth to the dark part of the moon at night, scientists measured what they call \"earthshine\" or albedo - basically Earth's reflectiveness. The studies suggested that the amount of low cloud cover over the eastern Pacific Ocean is reducing due to warming ocean temperatures. Since these clouds act like a mirror, reflecting light from the Sun back into space, without them that reflected light diminishes. So, according to these scientists, we might actually be taking the shine off our little blue dot. While we might be causing global warming, we're not the only species experiencing it. Some creatures are affected in truly surprising ways. In some reptiles, the sex of offspring is partly determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Genetically male central bearded dragons - a species of lizard found in Australia - will actually change from male to female when they are incubated over a certain temperature. So scientists are concerned that males could become increasingly rare as the world warms - putting the species at risk of extinction. In the ocean, rising levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide could be causing fish to lose their sense of smell . Climate change is also measurably messing up seasonal synchrony. In Wytham Wood this April - the UK's most scientifically studied woodland - great tit hatchlings emerged from their eggs up to three weeks earlier than they would have done in the 1940s. The entire spring food chain has shifted with warming - the caterpillars the birds eat, the oak tree leaves the caterpillars eat - all reach their peak weeks earlier than they did before we warmed up the world. While the seasons shift, many birds are adjusting - or just moving. This year, bee-eater chicks hatched in a Norfolk quarry - they are usually found in the southern Mediterranean and northern Africa. Even the soundscape is shifting. London's now a hotspot of unseasonal birdsong . One study has even suggested that forest birds were moving higher up in the trees to sing , possibly to avoid their calls being muffled by earlier foliage. Extreme weather is also making it harder to grow food. Staples like wheat, corn and coffee are already being affected. And this year, there have been some notable condiment shortages. In April, Huy Fong Foods, a California-based company that produces around 20 million bottles of Sriracha chilli sauce every year, sent a letter to customers warning of a \"severe shortage\" of chillies. In summer, supermarkets in France started to run out of Dijon mustard - a problem that could be traced to bad weather in the Canadian Prairies, where most of world's mustard seeds are grown. And the reality of climate change is even hampering efforts to go carbon-free. In August, the energy company EDF had to cut output from nuclear power stations situation in France, because there wasn't enough cool water in French rivers . The answer - being discussed by 200 countries at the UN climate summit right now - is a dramatic cut in those planet-heating gases. But we've already transformed our world by warming it up - and there are likely to be many more unexpected, and surprising, consequences.

{"id":null,"body":"Tackling climate change will require world leaders to take action on a global level. But as individuals we also contribute to warming emissions. Here are some things you can do to reduce your personal impact. From installing a heat pump to turning down the heating, there is a raft of changes around the home that can help the planet . \"Switching from a gas or oil-powered heating system to an electric heat pump makes a considerable difference,\" according to Dr Neil Jennings, an academic from Imperial College London. \"On a day-to-day basis, switching off lights and appliances when not in use can help us to save money while reducing our impact on climate change.\" The UK government currently offers grants of \u00a35,000 for the installation of heat pumps in England and Wales. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs until 2025. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint Improving insulation in our walls, ceilings and windows can reduce the loss of heat from our homes and the amount of energy needed to heat them. Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of insulation, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST) . This involves blocking up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out, such as around windows, doors or skirting boards. The EST estimates that draught-proofing could save \u00a3125 a year on average household bills. Switching to a green energy provider or a green tariff can significantly reduce your household's carbon footprint. But a recent increase in wholesale energy prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means many providers have withdrawn their offers. Livestock creates 14% of all greenhouse gases globally, with cattle being by far the largest contributor. The simplest and most effective way to limit your impact is to reduce meat and dairy in your diet, particularly red meat such as lamb and beef . Good news for vegans, obviously - but there are other considerations to take into account. It's not just a question of \"tagging individual products as good or bad\", says biologist Prof Margaret Gill of the University of Aberdeen. She says the carbon footprint of any given food also depends on how it is produced, where it comes from and whether it's in season. Dr Jonathan Foley, who investigates climate change solutions, says you can save money and reduce waste by making smaller portions and saving leftovers for later at home. The world wastes between 25% and 30% of its food, according to the Waste & Resources Action Programme . Between 8-10% of global carbon emissions are linked to unconsumed produce, according to a UN report . This video can not be played Climate Basics: CO2 explained Transport is responsible for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions . Living car-free might be \"the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our transport emissions,\" according to Dr Jennings . However, ditching the car is not possible for everyone, particularly if you live in an area without good public transport or are disabled. Small steps still have an impact, like walking and cycling to the local shops or sharing car journeys with friends or neighbours. Electric cars are becoming more widespread, but they are still prohibitively expensive for some people and charging infrastructure is limited in places. Unfortunately for keen travellers, flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things we can do as individuals. Domestic flights have the largest emissions per person per kilometre. Train journeys can have less than a fifth of the impact of a domestic flight, although they might be more expensive. Booking in advance can help reduce the cost. \"For those who fly a lot, reducing the number of flights you take will make a considerable difference to your personal footprint,\" says Dr Jennings. It takes 3,781 litres of water to make one pair of jeans, according to the UN's Environment Programme , taking into account cotton production, manufacture, transport and washing. You can limit your impact by repairing minor faults in clothing rather than replacing them, donating rather than throwing away and choosing higher-quality items that you think will last longer. An increasing number of companies are offering clothes to rent, which helps reduce waste in the fashion industry. You could also try buying second-hand. Choosing the right household appliances can also have a positive effect on your carbon footprint. Dr Jennings suggests making sure you are buying the most energy-efficient products, such as washing machines, when they need replacing.

{"id":null,"body":"Could the key to feeding the world with a changing climate be hiding in a 300-year-old museum collection? That's one of the hopes of scientists combing through 12,000 specimens of wheat and its relatives held in the Natural History Museum's archives. The most promising samples are having their genomes sequenced in a bid to identify the genetic secrets of hardier wheat varieties. Climate change and pests and diseases are putting the crop under pressure. The old varieties of wheat are stored in hundreds of old cardboard files, neatly lined up, row upon row, in the museum vaults. Each one contains dried leaves, stems or ears of grain, and sometimes all three, from centuries ago. They're carefully labelled, many in beautiful copper-plate handwriting, detailing exactly where and when they were found. It all provides useful information. \"The collection spans back to the 1700s, including a specimen that was collected on Captain Cook's first voyage to Australia,\" says Larissa Welton. She's part of the team digitising the archive so it can be accessed online. The James Cook sample is a wild wheat plant. It looks spindly and grass-like - quite different from the varieties growing in fields today. But it's these differences that the team is interested in.  \"We have specimens that are from before the introduction of various agricultural techniques, so they can tell us something about how wheat was growing wild or before things like artificial fertilisers.\" Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world - it\u2019s used for many foods, from bread and pasta, to breakfast cereal and cakes, and is an essential part of our diet. The war in Ukraine, where a great deal of grain is grown, has put global supply under threat. But it\u2019s not the only problem: climate change, and the extreme weather it brings, is having an impact, with scientists calculating that a 1C rise in global temperature can cause a reduction of up to 6.4% in the amount we can grow around the world.  Pests and diseases are also causing major challenges, reducing the projected annual yield by about a fifth each year. Modern wheat crops are struggling. The green revolution in the 1950s and 1960s led to farmers growing the varieties that produced the most grain. But this pursuit of producing the biggest harvests meant that other varieties were put aside - including crops able to cope with extremes - and the diversity of wheat was reduced. \u201cWe want to be able to see whether there are some of the things that we have lost, that we could basically capture and bring back to the modern varieties,\u201d explains Dr Matthew Clark, a geneticist at the Natural History Museum. And this is important: the world will need more wheat as the population grows - an estimated 60% more by 2050. So scientists need to find wheat varieties that can grow in places where it currently can't be grown - as well as crops that can withstand a changing environment. \u201cFor example, by looking at crops that were able to survive in more marginal areas - places with hot and dry climates - that could help more developing countries increase their food supply,\u201d says Dr Clark. He explains that this could be done through traditional plant breeding, genetic modification or gene editing, a technique where genes can be very precisely added, removed or replaced. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich are also hunting through old wheat samples.  Their archive, called the Watkins landrace collection, dates back 100 years and contains varieties from all over the world. It's stored at a chilly 4C, so the seeds are still viable, which means they can be planted and grown. \u201cWhat we want to do is look for new and useful genetic variation,\" explains Dr Simon Griffiths as he looks through the collection. \"So disease resistance, stress resistance, increased yield, increased fertiliser-use efficiency.\u201d The team at John Innes is taking some of the older varieties and cross-breeding them with modern ones - and they\u2019ve had some success. \u201cThere's a very important disease of wheat, which is a global problem, called yellow rust, and that's been increasingly difficult to control,\u201d Dr Griffiths says. \u201cWithin this collection of old wheats, there are new resistances to that disease, which stand up against this disease, and that's being deployed by breeders right now to defend this really important threat to wheat production.\u201d The team is also interested in finding more nutritious wheat varieties. \"What about what's in the wheat? We know that we can increase the fibre content, the mineral content of wheat,\" he says. \"There's so much diversity that hasn't been fully exploited yet by modern wheat breeders, and we think we can bring that to them.\" The wheat we grow is going to have to change - scientists hope that looking back into our past and rediscovering lost varieties could be the best way to move forward.

{"id":null,"body":"The UK government is allowing the fossil fuel industry to waste large amounts of gas, according to a leading environmental think-tank. Green Alliance says oil and gas companies are wasting enough methane to power more than 700,000 UK homes. It says high energy prices mean more of the gas should be captured and used. A spokesperson for UK oil and gas companies rejected that, saying it was not profitable to capture all of it. Scientists say that methane is, alongside carbon dioxide, one of the main contributors to global warming. \"It's a scandal,\" Dustin Benton of Green Alliance told BBC News. \"The government should force these companies to capture the methane they're currently wasting.\" UK methane emissions have fallen significantly since 1990 but in recent years progress has slowed. \"The big attraction for reducing methane is you get a big bang for your buck very quickly in terms of tackling climate change,\" Professor Dave Reay from the University of Edinburgh told BBC News. \"If we cut emissions very quickly we'll see that impact in terms of reduced warming in the atmosphere very quickly.\" Most UK methane emissions now come from farming and waste disposal. While reducing methane leakage from those sources is complex, cutting down on it in the oil and gas production that accounts for 11% of emissions is considered low-hanging fruit.  The vast bulk of the UK oil and gas industry is located offshore in the North Sea. Methane is brought to the surface as a routine part of production. Part of it is flared (burnt); vented (released) or leaks out of pipes. The North Sea Transition Authority regulates the UK's oil and gas industry and has published a series of guidelines on methane emissions . They include the goal of \"zero routine flaring and venting\" by 2030 and states that \"flaring and venting and associated emissions should be at the lowest possible levels in the circumstances.\" But critics say there's not enough monitoring or enforcement. In October 2021 the International Energy Agency (IEA) calculated that 45% of global methane emissions could be stopped at no net cost to the oil and gas companies. Now, stopping emissions should even be profitable, says Green Alliance; Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring, meaning it should now be cost-effective for almost all the wasted gas to be captured and used. \"We estimate that around 750,000 homes could be heated this winter if we stopped flaring and instead piped that gas into peoples homes,\" said Mr Benton. \"In terms of leakage it's a bit more unclear but we think its between 100,000 and 150,000 homes that is just being lost into the atmosphere.\" Both the fossil fuel industry and the government says it's not that simple and point at steady reductions in methane emissions in recent years as proof of progress. \"The volumes that are being vented and flared are not large in the context of UK greenhouse gas emissions,\" says Charles McAllister from UK Onshore Oil and Gas. \"Some of these facilities are quite old. To repurpose them to capture what the Environment Agency would call \"de minimis\" (lacking importance) volumes of methane is not economically viable.\" A spokesperson from the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government is \"working diligently with regulators to drive down methane emissions from oil and gas operations in the North Sea.\" A small fraction of the UK's methane emissions come from onshore drilling and fossil fuel infrastructure. The BBC accompanied the Clean Air Task Force, an international environmental organisation, on a hunt for the gas in rural Hampshire. From a public footpath, Theo Humann pointed what looked like a chunky camcorder through a metal fence at a small oil well. It's an optical gas imaging camera, which measures heat differences and infrared energy. On Mr Humann's screen the methane showed up as a distinctively coloured disturbance emerging from a tall pipe. \"This is an old well so probably not connected to a gas grid or a processing facility. So the easiest option for the site operator is just release it,\" said Mr Humann. \"The technology exists to capture the gas that's being vented and emitted from the various equipment that we see on this site,\" Clean Air Task Force campaign manager James Turrito said outside the gate to the oil well. \"This is absolutely avoidable.\" Huge methane emission from Russian coal mine Australia methane emissions hugely under-reported Huge oil and gas leaks mapped from space Oil price cap will hit Putin immediately, says US New Malaysia PM's honeymoon will be brutally short 'I'm living in fear for my life in Afghanistan' Why 1,000 crocodiles are being relocated in India The new generation powering China's protests Cloaking Xi Jinping dissent in Jiang nostalgia New Malaysia PM's honeymoon will be brutally short The 'life-changing' electric suit.

The Department of Transport said the project will also produce 300,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year. The UK government said this was \"enough to fly to the moon and back about 60 times\" and equates to around 14,331,300 miles (23,063,991 km).

{"id":null,"body":"The polar regions and Europe were hit hardest by global warming in 2022, according to a new analysis. The data from Copernicus, the EU's climate monitoring service, says 2022 was the fifth warmest year globally. Europe experienced its warmest summer, with temperatures increasing by more than twice the global average over the past three decades, faster than any other continent. The last eight years are now also the warmest eight yet recorded. Last year saw a continuation of a pattern of global warming that has become the new normal, say Copernicus scientists. While the La Ni\u00f1a weather event helped to cool the oceans for the third year in a row, global temperatures were still approximately 0.3C higher in 2022 than the 1991-2020 reference period. Researchers say this means that last year was close to 1.2C above the 1850-1900 period, taken as the start of global industrialisation. Europe and the polar regions were at the sharp end of this high heat. Temperature records in many western European countries were broken including the UK , with summer heatwaves and intense droughts hitting many parts. Even the normally cooler month of October in Europe was some 2C above average last year. While the west of the continent was extremely hot, colder weather in northern and eastern countries saw the year overall drop to second warmest in Europe. \"We're already experiencing climate change now,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. \"The heatwaves that we saw in Europe over the summer, but also the spring, and also the autumn ... many people will remember the heatwave that we had over the New Year's period as well. So we're seeing heatwaves, not only in the summer, but in the rest of the seasons.\" Over the past 30 years, temperatures in European countries have increased by more than twice the global average. According to the Copernicus service, Europe has the highest rate of temperature increase of any continent in the world. This is due to a number of factors, say researchers. Land areas are warming faster than the seas, so this is helping make Europe warmer. Another factor is proximity to the Arctic, which is warming at around four times the global average. Part of the reason is that ice is more reflective and less absorbent of sunlight. When ice melts it reveals darker areas of land or sea, and this results in increased sunlight absorption and thus warming. Apart from Europe there were significant record heat events in the Middle East, Central Asia and China with heatwave conditions in Pakistan and parts of India. The two polar regions again saw record high heat with temperatures in some places rising by more than 2C above the 1991-2020 average. In north-western Siberia, temperatures reached 3C above the average. At Vostok in Antarctica, the mercury reached -17.7C, the warmest in the weather station's 65-year history. The centre of Greenland also recorded values that were 8C higher than average during September. Looking at the global picture, the last eight years were all more than 1C above the long term average. This is getting closer to breaching the 1.5C threshold that's a key limit for the Paris climate agreement. \"If we do a fairly simple linear extrapolation, and if we look at the current level of emissions and current level of warming, we will hit 1.5C sometime in the early 2030,\" said Samantha Burgess. \"So we're already living on borrowed time effectively and borrowed emissions as well.\" Last year also saw the impact of a number of extreme events linked to climate change, with flooding in Pakistan perhaps the most destructive, with large loss of life. Across the world, levels of warming gases also increased, with methane going up by more than the average of recent years. Another cause for concern will be the carbon output from forest fires, with France, Germany, Spain and Slovenia all experiencing their highest summer wildfire emissions in 20 years. Further insight into the state of the climate in 2022 will come later this week when a number of other meteorological agencies will report their data. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc .

{"id":null,"body":"Technology to remove the planet-warming greenhouse gas CO2 from our atmosphere must be urgently ramped up, leading climate experts say in a new report. Scientists say big cuts in CO2 emissions won't be enough to limit global warming. And nature alone will not remove enough of it from the air. CO2 is the most important gas warming the planet, and is emitted when fossil fuels such as gas and oil are burnt. \"To limit warming to 2C or lower, we need to accelerate emissions reductions. But the findings of this report are clear: we also need to increase carbon removal too,\" says lead author Dr Steve Smith from Oxford University. \"Many new methods are emerging with potential.\" There's consensus among scientists that the world is warming primarily because emissions of CO2 (estimated at 33 billion tonnes in 2021) far exceed the amount that is being removed (this report suggests two billion tonnes a year). Until emissions and removals are balanced - so called \"net-zero\" - global temperatures are predicted to rise. But getting there won't be easy. The latest UN climate reports say to fully achieve \"net zero\" there will need to be some CO2 removal, so called \"negative emissions\", to compensate for sectors that can't easily decarbonise. Currently almost all of the world's CO2 removal occurs through natural processes. That's primarily plants and trees taking in CO2 from the air, and the soil absorbing and storing it. But there are limits to how much nature can do. For example, how much more of the world can realistically be given over to forests? Some optimistic scenarios suggest that natural CO2 removal could be doubled by 2050, but that's still only about 4 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. This new report titled \"The State of Carbon Dioxide Removal\" says that to restrict and reduce global temperatures in the future there needs to be investment in developing technological solutions now. The methods it cites are all fairly new, and at different stages of development and deployment. Put together they currently only make up a tiny fraction of the worlds CO2 removal. One, known as BECCS, involves incorporating CO2 capture into biomass-based electricity-generation, in which organic matter such as crops and wood pellets are burned to produce power. Other options include: huge facilities where the carbon is extracted from the air before being stored in the ground; the use of specially treated charcoal (biochar) that locks in carbon; and \"enhanced rock weathering\" - loosely based on the carbon removal that occurs with natural erosion. The use of CO2 removal technologies is not without its critics. Some campaigners doubt that they can be cost effective and fear  that they can be an excuse to defer and delay the transition away from fossil fuel use. This report stresses that removing CO2 should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\" to tackle climate change but that meeting the UN's climate goals will require technology as well as nature to reduce greenhouse gas levels. That all assumes that global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels will, as pledged at numerous climate summits, fall rapidly. So far yearly emissions have yet to start a downward trend.

{"id":null,"body":"Billionaire Bill Gates has invested in an Australian climate technology start-up that plans to reduce the methane emissions of cow burps. The Microsoft co-founder has been outspoken about the environmental impact of meat production. Methane is the most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2). Livestock such as cows, goats and deer produce methane when their stomachs are breaking down hard fibres like grass for digestion. This fermentation process creates methane gas which is then mostly belched out again. University studies have shown that feeding cows seaweed could significantly cut their methane emissions. Perth-based start-up Rumin8 is working on a dietary supplement - synthetically replicated from red seaweed - which stops the creation of the gas. It announced in a statement that it had raised $12m (\u00a39.7m) in a funding round led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which Mr Gates founded in 2015. The investment firm is also backed by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, and Chinese entrepreneur and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma. \"We have been very pleased with the reception we have received from climate impact funds around the world,\" Rumin8's managing director David Messina said. \"There is a genuine desire to fund solutions to enteric methane emissions from livestock and fortunately for Rumin8, they can see the benefits of our technology,\" he added. Last October, New Zealand proposed taxing the greenhouse gases that farm animals produce from burping and urinating in a bid to tackle climate change. The world-first scheme will see farmers paying for agricultural emissions in some form by 2025. Almost half the country's total greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mainly methane. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules. Over a 100-year period methane is 28 to 34 times as warming as CO2.
