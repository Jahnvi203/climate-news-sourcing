His protest in LA involved scientists chaining themselves to the doors of a JPMorgan Chase building. \u201cI\u2019m here because  scientists are not being listened to . I\u2019m willing to take a risk for this gorgeous planet,\u201d Dr Kalmus said while chained to the door. He then started to cry as he added: \u201cFor my sons.\u201d \u201cThis is for all of the kids of the world, all of the young people, all of the future people,\u201d Dr Kalmus said later. \u201cThis is so much bigger than any of us.\u201d Dr Kalmus tweeted the next day that he and other protestors had been arrested and linked to an essay he penned for The Guardian  reiterating the urgency of addressing the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all of us to stand up, and take risks, and make sacrifices for this beautiful planet that gives us life, that gives us everything,\u201d Dr Kalmus said in the video. The protest occurred at Chase in protest of the bank\u2019s fossil fuel financing, the Scientist Rebellion group said.  JPMorgan Chase was the largest financer of fossil fuels of any bank in the world from 2016 through 2021, providing $382bn over that six-year period, according to  a report  from a consortium of NGOs. Protestors also took to the streets in Spain on the same day, throwing fake blood outside the Congress of Deputies in Madrid.  Scientists and fellow supporters protested at the Ministry of Environment in Quito, Ecuador and at the Climate Ministry in Copenhagen, according to  Scientist Rebellion \u2018s Twitter account . The group  describes themselves  as \u201cactivists from a variety of scientific backgrounds,\u201d and states that they \u201cwork within the framework of Extinction Rebellion\u2026 but adopt some new forms of organising and mobilising\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The chapter outlines how the world can limit global heating to under 1.5 C as outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The world\u2019s leading authority on climate science published Monday an assessment of how the world can reduce the rate of climate change. It outlines how we can limit global heating to under 1.5 C as outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. More than 270 authors from 65 countries wrote the assessment which is the third chapter of\u00a0the  United Nations\u2019  Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate  Change report. The first chapter looked at the causes of climate change, the second at the impacts and the third at how we can limit it. Here  The Independent  has pulled out 5 of the key takeaways from the latest chapter.  Greenhouse gas emissions will have to start declining by 2025 to limit warming to 1.5C In the scenarios assessed by the authors of the report, limiting warming by around 1.5C requires global greenhouse gas emissions to start declining by 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030. At the same time, methane would also need to be reduced by about a third. Nevertheless, even if this is done the authors said it was almost inevitable that the world will temporarily exceed 1.5C but could return to below it by the end of the century. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C, \u201d said IPCC Working Group III Co -Chair Jim Skea. \u201cWithout immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.\u201d Even limiting warming to around 2C still requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by a quarter by 2030. Without a strengthening of policies beyond those that were implemented by the end of 2020, the report says greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2C by 2100.  Finance is 3-6 times lower than the amount needed by 2030 to keep warming below 2C The report finds that finance is three to six times lower than the amount needed by 2030 to limit warming to below 2C. The report finds that there is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close investment gaps. However, it says that if this money is to be directed, it will require clear signalling from governments and the international community. The report says that reduction options costing $100 per tonne of greenhouse gases could reduce global emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030. The global economic benefit of limiting warming to 2C will likely exceed the cost of reducing and removing gases The report says that the global economic benefit of limiting warming to 2C, exceeds the cost of reducing emissions and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in most scenarios. The economic benefits of avoiding damages from climate change, and of reducing adaptation costs, increase with the stringency of efforts to reduce and remove greenhouse gas emissions, it says.  Cost of solar dropped 85% from 2010-2019 The cost of low-emission technologies such as wind, solar and batteries has dropped significantly since 2010 and there has been a large increase in their deployment. From 2010-2019, the cost of solar energy decreased by 85 per cent, wind energy by 55 per cent and lithium ion batteries by 85 per cent, according to the report. Over the same period, solar units were deployed over ten times more and electric vehicles over 100 times more, although this varied across regions. The policy tools used to reduce costs and spur on use include public research and development, funding for pilot projects and subsidies. Changes in our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40 to 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 The report says that \u201cchoice architecture\u201d can help people adopt low greenhouse gas emission options such as sustainable, healthy diets, shifts to walking and cycling and sustainable consumption of repairable products. The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and well being, the report says. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals, the report adds.

The feature, enabled by 24 million satellite photos compiled into a 4D experience, means that anyone can see how the  world  has changed and get a better picture of the environmental difficulties we now face. \u201cOur planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century \u2014 more than any other point in human history. Many of us have experienced these changes in our own communities; I myself was among the thousands of Californians evacuated from their homes during the state\u2019s wildfires last year. For other people, the effects of climate change feel abstract and far away, like melting ice caps and receding  glaciers ,\u201d a Google representative said in the search giant\u2019s announcement. \u201cWith Timelapse in Google Earth, we have a clearer picture of our changing planet right at our fingertips \u2014 one that shows not just problems but also solutions, as well as mesmerizingly beautiful natural phenomena that unfold over decades.\u201d Google worked with experts at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s\u00a0CREATE Lab to develop Timelapse, with guided tours on five environmental topics: \u00a0\u2018forest change \u2019, \u00a0\u2018urban growth \u2019, \u2018 warming temperatures \u2019, \u00a0\u2018sources of energy \u2019, and the planet\u2019s  \u2018fragile beauty \u2019. Such a technological feat was not easy; it took over two million processing hours in Google Cloud to compile the 20 petabytes of satellite imagery into a single 4.4 terapixel-sized video mosaic, made up of quadrillions of pixels. Google Earth will be updated annually with new imagery for Timelapse over the next decade. The history of Google Earth is a peculiar one. The technology was  originally used to visualise battlefields during the Iraq War, when it was being invested in by the CIA . Google bought Keyhole, the company that developed the \u2018Earthviewer\u2019 program, as it was called, outright in 2004. At the time, much of the imagery in Google Earth was commercially available data from US military satellites, but the company eventually replaced it with its Street View content \u2013 which it owns the copyright for \u2013 so that it would not have to pixelate sensitive areas. Our own planet is  not the only one visible on Google Earth . In 2017, Google also introduced the ability to look at planets, dwarf planets, moons, and the International Space Station into the software.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in As governments and industries across the world pledge to minimise their environmental footprints,  Saman Javed  speaks to experts about the changes we need to see in 2022 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Experts have weighed in on today\u2019s most pressing issues, and how we can tackle them in the coming year A  \u201ccode red for  humanity \u201d. Those were the words that dominated headlines last year as the United Nations\u2019  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) released the first chapter of its landmark report, sounding alarm bells that the internationally agreed threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius of global  heating  was \u201cperilously close\u201d. Its publication came amidst a summer of  wildfires , which tore through  landscapes  in California, parts of Greece, Turkey, Israel, Cyprus, Italy and Siberia. The effects were devastating; in the US alone the Dixie Fire burned 963,309 acres before it was contained. Globally, the fires were responsible for the release of 6450 megatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. One author of the IPCC report, professor Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading, said the consequences of global heating \u2013 like wildfires and melting ice caps\u00a0\u2013 will only \u201ccontinue to get worse\u201d. \"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet,\u201d he added. In November 2021 world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate summit, which saw India commit to reaching net zero by 2070 \u2013 less than 100 years after it started using fossil fuels. Additionally, China and the US, the world\u2019s largest emitters of planet-heating carbon emissions, made a joint declaration that they will work together to create \u201cconcrete\u201d solutions to the climate crisis. What we need is a global infrastructure and global economic systems that are not built on burning fossil fuels There were also wide sweeping pledges to phase out coal use, end the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and reduce methane emissions. While these were significant steps,  independent analysis  by research group Climate Action Tracker found that the targets are \u201cinconsistent with net zero goals\u201d, and that even if met, greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be twice as high as necessary for the 1.5C threshold. However 2021 did bring some climate wins. In May, a Dutch court ruled that Shell must slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, while PepsiCo dedicated seven million acres of land to regenerative agriculture \u2013 a move which could eliminate three million tonnes of emissions. Elsewhere, renewables are booming. Record high numbers of renewable energy technologies \u2013 mostly in the form of wind turbines and solar panels \u2013 were installed in 2021, with the capacity to generate around 290 gigawatts of energy. According to the  International Energy Agency , if the industry continues to grow at current levels, renewable electricity capacity could exceed that of fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined by 2026. But as we look forward to 2022, it\u2019s clear that ambitious net zero targets pose a myriad of difficulties. Experts from sectors across the board, including the food and fashion industries, paint a picture of a problem that is multifaceted, involves hundreds of players and spans the globe. While some have proposed inventive new policies, others are calling for a complete overhaul of existing systems.  The Independent  spoke to a range of experts about today\u2019s most pressing issues, and how we can tackle them in the coming year. World leaders made several climate commitments at Cop26; 105 countries promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, 40 countries vowed to phase out coal power by 2040 and more than 30 nations and 11 car manufacturers pledged that all new cars and vans will be zero emissions by 2040.  Additionally, a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent was signed by 105 governments including six of the biggest emitters of the gas \u2013 US, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, President of Congo Felix Tshisekedi and US President Joe Biden at Cop26 Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, says that while the targets demonstrate \u201csomething approaching a shared agenda for full decarbonisation\u201d, we will only benefit once we see a physical decline in emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to put too much faith in promises until we see real action to keep them,\u201d he says. As it stands, emissions across the world are not declining. While a 2021 report by the  Global Carbon Project  showed that emissions fell by 5.4 per cent in 2020, it estimated that they would grow by 4.9 per cent as demand for coal, oil and gas rebounded with the economy following the first year of the pandemic.  We need more energy efficient heating and housing, and less coal, less gas and less oil being produced and burned This bounceback has already been seen in the US, where greenhouse gas emissions rose by 6.2 per cent in 2021, according to independent research institute  Rhodium Group . The findings, published earlier this month, note that while emissions are still 5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, \u201cprogress in reducing emissions was reversed in 2021\u2026putting the US even further off track from achieving its 2030 climate targets\u201d. \u201cIn addition to more renewables, we need more energy efficient heating and housing, less coal, less gas and less oil being produced and burned,\u201d Parr adds. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult bit \u2013 not developing new, clean technologies, which everyone supports and have no, or few, downsides \u2013 but shrinking the old, dirty industries which those new technologies replace.\u201d While the overall consensus is that the world must move beyond its reliance on fossil fuels, it\u2019s undeniable that we are heavily reliant on carbon. This poses the question of whether it\u2019s possible to stop burning fossil fuels, and the experts are divided. Dr Friederike Otto, a climatologist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London, says the only way to stop the climate crisis from getting worse is to stop burning fossil fuels globally. \u201cTherefore we need to enable all countries to do that, to transition to an economy that\u2019s not based on burning fossil fuels because otherwise the temperatures will continue to rise,\u201d Otto says. Experts have long called for an end to burning fossil fuels But others believe that a full transition to net zero before global temperatures reach the 1.5C limit may prove impossible. Myles Allen, the director of Oxford University\u2019s Net Zero initiative, says \u201cwe need to stop climate change before the world stops using fossil fuels\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait and hope that the world will stop using fossil fuels in time, it won\u2019t. It\u2019s perhaps possible for a rich country like the UK, which is very well endowed with renewable resources, but even that would require very substantial changes,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the whole world, it\u2019s out of the question.\u201d If we can establish the principle that anyone pulling up fossil fuels must dispose of the CO2, it puts the responsibility on the fossil fuel producer Allen is backing a  \u201cCarbon Takeback\u201d policy , which he hopes governments will adopt in 2022. This would force any company extracting fossil fuels from the ground to capture the CO2 they produce and remove it from the atmosphere, by pushing it deep underground. \u201cThe conversation we need to have is about the responsibility of fossil fuel suppliers to take care of the climate impact of the product they sell,\u201d Allen says. \u201cIf we can establish the principle that anyone pulling up fossil fuels must dispose of the CO2, it puts the responsibility on the fossil fuel producer. Therefore, if you\u2019re buying fossil fuels anywhere in the world, the climate impact has already been taken care of.\u201d The  UN reports  that our food systems are responsible for 34 per cent of global emissions. Dan Saladino, author of  Eating to Extinction: The World\u2019s Rarest Foods and Why We Need to Save Them , says our reliance on fossil fuels at every point of the food supply chain \u2013 from the production of fertiliser to farming of crops, growing feed for livestock and the transportation of goods \u2013 has \u201ccreated a future full of risks\u201d. This risk was highlighted in September 2021 when two fertiliser plants in the north of England were forced to stop operations because of a steep increase in energy prices. \u201cWe understood how heavily dependent we are on fossil fuels, not just for fertiliser but because of the knock-on effects that had on other forms of food production,\u201d Saladino says. There are 200,000 varieties of wheat The fragility of our food systems and their dependency on fossil fuels is intrinsically linked with an increasing loss of biodiversity. While 200,000 different kinds of wheat are available in seed banks across the world \u2013 each adapted to different climates and with varying nutrient densities \u2013 British farmers likely grow from a list containing fewer than 10. By limiting the variety of our foods, we\u2019ve created \u201chigh-yielding crops that need huge amounts of input to deliver, and we\u2019ve lost that adaptability\u201d, Saladino says. \u201cIt works very well, only if every single part of the process is designed and can be predicted. You throw in climate change and more erratic weather patterns, whether it\u2019s excess rainfall or drought, and that system is extremely fragile.\u201d Looking ahead to 2022, the food industry needs to see a \u201ctop down, bottom up\u201d approach involving governments, business and consumers, says Patrick Holden, the founder of the Sustainable Food Trust. \u201cWe need a polluter pays principle so that people who cause damage are financially responsible for their actions, but the government won\u2019t act if there\u2019s no public pressure.\u201d As consumers, need to learn more about the story of our food While there\u2019s no doubt that public attitudes are shifting, there are concerns that consumers might not have the full picture of how our food systems impact the environment. One example is the meat industry. Last October, a study by the  University of Oxford revealed  that people in the UK are eating, on average per day, 13.7g less red meat but 3.7g more white meat than a decade ago. But while the majority of livestock emissions do indeed come from red meat, chicken has its own environmental footprint. This week, the  Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported  that Cargill, a major supplier of animal feed in Britain, is still purchasing soybeans from farms built on deforested land. The multi-billion dollar business previously pledged to clean up its supply chains after a 2020 investigation found that its chicken feed is sold to major retailers such as Tesco, Asda, Nando's and McDonalds. \u201cThis is why we need to be better informed about the way our current farming systems work, and why we, as consumers, need to learn more about the story of our food,\u201d Holden says. Last year, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority published its Green Claims Code. From January 2022, brands must not make vague or misleading sustainability claims, be able to substantiate all claims with robust and current evidence, and not omit or hide any important information. Textile waste from the fashion industry is a huge polluter Separately, more retailers embraced the second-hand clothing market. Vestiaire Collective partnered with Alexander McQueen on a new initiative that calls on trusted clients to sell their unworn pieces, while both Net-a-Porter and Harvey Nicols now offer customers a space to sell their pre-loved garments. But the fashion industry\u2019s footprint is large, and there is still much to be done. According to research by McKinsey, the fashion world is responsible for 40 million tonnes of textile waste per year. In  its State of Fashion 2022 report , industry experts highlighted closed-loop recycling \u2013 the process of collecting old clothing and recycling it into new products \u2013 as a \u201ccritical opportunity\u201d to reduce waste. Action is already being taken by Swedish textile recycling company Renewcell, which has partnered with H&M, Levi\u2019s and Beyond Retro\u2019s parent company Bank & Vogue, with plans to recycle up to 60,000 tonnes of textiles this year. Fast fashion cycles are moving quicker than ever, with companies like Boohoo raking in record profits in 2021. There have been attempts to slow the cycle, namely in the form of popular rental fashion services like By Rotation and My Wardrobe HQ, but even these have their drawbacks. Fashion brands must take responsibility for their entire supply chain, all the way down to the raw materials, and the people involved As one 2021 study, published in the scientific journal  Environmental Research , concluded that renting your wardrobe has a higher climate impact than buying new clothes, due to hidden environmental costs in delivery and packaging. Additionally, many brands are still not taking responsibility for their entire supply chains\u201d, C\u00e9line Semaan, the founder of  Slow Factory , says. One area where she hopes to see improvement is a move away from suppliers with links to deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, which scientists have predicted is on \u201cthe brink of an environmental collapse\u201d. \u201cFashion brands must take responsibility for their entire supply chain, all the way down to the raw materials, and the people involved. Over 100 fashion brands are linked to its deforestation,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2022 we expect a response, and a significant bold action to restore the Amazon Rainforest.\u201d Last year, experts at the University of Exeter and the Met Office produced the UK\u2019s third national  Climate Change Risk Assessment . Richard Betts, who led the technical report, says \u201cone of the biggest things we learned in 2021 is how badly prepared the UK is for climate change\u201d. A key finding of the assessment was that the gap between the level of risk posed by the climate crisis and adaptive measures taken by the government has widened, which means that we are \u201cunderprepared, even for the things that are already happening\u201d, Betts adds. The Dixie Fire burned almost one million acres of land Specifically, the likelihood of extremely high summer temperatures has increased by 15 per cent in recent years, while 4,000 heat-related deaths have been recorded in England since 2018. These are thought to be associated with high indoor temperatures in homes, care homes and hospitals. Additionally, the assessment noted that changes to the climate had increased the risk of landslides in old coal tips. \u201cThere are 2000 of these tips in Wales, and nearly 300 have been identified as \u201chigh risk\u201d. Dealing with those has now become more urgent because heavy rainfall has already increased in South Wales,\u201d Betts says. Positively, in December 2021,  the government updated  its Building Regulations to require newly built homes, care homes and schools to mitigate overheating risks. The new regulations will take effect from June 2022 onwards. Ahead of Cop26, the Office for National Statistics found that 75 per cent of UK adults are worried about the impact of climate change. But when fossil fuels and industry are responsible for 89 per cent of global emissions, as reported by the IPCC, it\u2019s difficult to know whether changing our personal behaviours can make any positive impact. The experts are also somewhat divided. In 2020, Oxfam reported that the richest 10 per cent of the world \u2013 mostly people in the US and the EU \u2013 accounted for more than 50 per cent of all emissions between 1990 and 2015, more than double the carbon footprint of the poorest half of humanity.  At the time, Tim Gore, head of climate policy at the charity, urged governments in the west to curb their citizens\u2019 emissions by implementing bans on SUVs and frequent flying. Experts believe the public should fly less  Lorraine Whitmarsh, an environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, says \u201ccutting down car use and flying, using renewable energy, and cutting down on red meat and dairy\u201d are all effective behaviours. \u201cIf everyone did these things it would make a big difference. In fact, at least most of the changes needed to get to net zero require behaviour change,\u201d Whitmarsh adds. But Dr Otto is less convinced that personal changes can offset the impact of the world\u2019s biggest polluters. Instead, she is encouraging individuals to lobby their local MPs by drawing up petitions, taking part in protests and voting.\u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s not about individual consumption,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what the big companies want us to think, because then they can continue doing what they do \u2013 selling fossil fuels \u2013 and then we feel guilty for burning them.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up about whether you fly on holidays because that will not solve the problem. What we need is a global infrastructure and global economic systems that are not built on burning fossil fuels.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

But are we really heading towards a collective suicide? We instinctively feel that b y destroying the Amazon rainforests, Brazilians are killing \u201cthe lungs of our Earth\u201d. However, if we want to confront seriously threats to our environment, what we should avoid are precisely such quick extrapolations which fascinate our imagination. Two or three decades ago, everyone in Europe was talking about  Waldsterben , the dying of forests. The topic was on the covers of all popular weeklies, and there were calculations of how in half a century Europe will be without forests. Now there are  more forests in Europe  than at any point in the 20th century, and we are becoming aware of other dangers \u2013 of what happens in the depth of the oceans, for example.  While we should take ecological threats extremely seriously, we should also be fully aware of how uncertain analyses and projections are in this domain \u2013 we will know for sure what is going on only when it is too late. Fast extrapolations only hand arguments to climate change deniers. We should avoid at all costs the trap of an \u201cecology of fear\u201d, a hasty, morbid fascination with looming catastrophe.  This ecology of fear has the hallmarks of a developing, predominant form of ideology in global capitalism, a new opium for the masses replacing the declining religion. It takes over the old religion\u2019s fundamental function, that of installing an unquestionable authority which can impose limits.  Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty AFP AP AFP\/Getty AP Reuters EPA Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters AP AFP\/Getty Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters EPA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty EPA The lesson hammered into us is that of our own finitude: we are just one species on our Earth embedded in a biosphere which reaches far beyond our horizon. In our exploitation of natural resources, we are borrowing from the future, so one should treat our Earth with respect, as something ultimately sacred, something that should not be unveiled totally, that should and will forever remain a mystery, a power we should trust, not dominate.  While we cannot gain full mastery over our biosphere, it is, unfortunately, in our power to derail it, to disturb its balance so that it will run amok, swiping us away in the process. This is why, although ecologists are all the time demanding that we make radical changes to our way of life, underlying this demand is its opposite: a deep distrust of change, of development, of progress. Every radical change can have the unintended consequence of catastrophe. Things get even more difficult here. Even when we profess the readiness to assume responsibility for ecological catastrophes, this can be a tricky stratagem to avoid facing the true scale of the threat. There is something deceptively reassuring in this readiness to assume the guilt for threats to our environment: we like to be guilty since, if we are guilty, then it all depends on us, we pull the strings of the catastrophe, so we can also save ourselves simply by changing our lives.  What is really difficult for us (at least for us in the west) to accept is that we might be reduced to a purely passive role of impotent observers who can only sit and watch our fate. To avoid this, we are prone to engage in frantic activity, we recycle old paper, buy organic food, whatever, just so that we can be sure we are doing something, making our contribution. We are like a soccer fan who supports his team in front of a TV screen at home, shouting and jumping from his seat, in a superstitious belief that this will somehow influence the outcome. It is true that the typical form of fetishist disavowal around ecology is: \u201cI know very well (that we are all threatened), but I don\u2019t really believe it (so I am not ready to do anything really important like changing my way of life).\u201d  But there is also the opposite form of disavowal: \u201cI know very well that I cannot really influence the process which can lead to my ruin (like a volcanic outburst), but it is nonetheless too traumatic for me to accept this, so I cannot resist the urge to do something, even if I know it is ultimately meaningless.\u201d  Is it not for that reason we buy organic food? Who really believes that the half-rotten and expensive \u201corganic\u201d apples are really healthier? The point is that, by way of buying them, we do not just buy and consume a product \u2013 we simultaneously do something meaningful, show our care and global awareness, we participate in a large collective project. The predominant ecological ideology treats us as  a priori  guilty, indebted to Mother Nature, under the constant pressure of the ecological superego agency which addresses us in our individuality: \u201cWhat did you do today to repay your debt to nature? Did you put all your newspapers into a proper recycling bin? And all the bottles of beer or cans of Coke? Did you use your bike or public transport instead of your car? Did you open the windows wide rather than firing up the air conditioning?\u201d The ideological stakes of such individualisation are easy to see: I get lost in my own self-examination instead of raising much more pertinent global questions about our entire industrial civilization. Ecology thus lends itself easily to ideological mystification. It can be a pretext for New Age obscuration (the praising of the pre-modern etc), or for neocolonialism (developed world complaints of the threat of rapid growth in developing countries such as Brazil or China), or as a cause to honour \u201cgreen capitalists\u201d (buy green and recycle, as if taking into account ecology justifies capitalist exploitation). All of these tensions exploded in our reactions to the recent Amazon fires.  There are five main strategies to distract from the true dimensions of the ecological threat. First there is simple ignorance: it\u2019s a marginal phenomenon, not worthy of our preoccupation, life goes on, nature will take care of itself. Second, there is the belief that science and technology can save us. Third, that we should leave the solution to the market (with higher taxation of polluters, etc). Fourth, we resort to the superego pressure on personal responsibility instead of large systemic measures (each of us should do what we can \u2013 recycle, consume less, etc). And fifth, perhaps the worst, is the advocating of a return to natural balance, to a more modest, traditional life by means of which we renounce human hubris and become again respectful children of our Mother Nature.  This whole paradigm of Mother Nature derailed by our hubris is wrong. The fact that our main sources of energy (oil, coal) are remnants of past catastrophes which occurred prior to the advent of humanity is a clear reminder that Mother Nature is cold and cruel. This, of course, in no way means that we should relax and trust our future: the fact that it is not clear what is going on makes the situation even more dangerous. Plus, as it is fast becoming evident, migrations (and walls meant to prevent them) are getting more and more intertwined with ecological disturbances like global warming. The ecological apocalypse and the refugees apocalypse are more and more overlapping in what Philip Alston, a UN special rapporteur, described entirely accurately:  \u201cWe risk a \u2018climate apartheid\u2019 scenario,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.\u201d  Those least  responsible for global emissions also have the least capacity to protect themselves. So, the Leninist question: what is to be done? We are in a deep mess: there is no simple \u201cdemocratic\u201d solution here. The idea that people themselves (not just governments and corporations) should decide sounds deep, but it begs an important question: even if their comprehension is not distorted by corporate interests, what qualifies them to pass judgement in such a delicate matter?  What we can do is at least set the priorities straight and admit the absurdity of our geopolitical war games when the very planet for which wars are fought is under threat.  In the Amazon, we see the ridiculous game of Europe blaming Brazil and Brazil blaming Europe. It has to stop. Ecological threats make it clear that the era of sovereign nation states is approaching its end \u2013  a strong global agency is needed with the power to coordinate the necessary measures. And does such the need for such an agency point in the direction of what we once called \u201ccommunism\u201d?

The Arctic Ocean began warming rapidly at the beginning of the last century by a process called Atlantification as warmer and saltier waters flowed in from the Atlantic, the researchers said.  While the process of turning the Arctic Ocean into a state resembling the Atlantic is one of the main drivers of warming in the region, instrumental records capable of monitoring this change, such as satellites, only go back about 40 years, they explained. In the new study,  published in the journal  Science Advances  on Wednesday, an international group of scientists reconstructed the recent history of ocean warming at the gateway to the Arctic Ocean in a region called the Fram Strait, between Greenland and Svalbard. They reconstructed the change in water column properties, such as temperature and salinity over the past 800 years \u2014 looking for signature signs of Atlantification \u2014 by analysing the geochemical and ecological data from ocean sediments and marine microorganisms. \u201cWhen we looked at the whole 800-year timescale, our temperature and salinity records look pretty constant,\u201d Tesi Tommaso, a co-lead author of the study from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council in Bologna, Italy, said in a statement. \u201cBut all of a sudden at the start of the 20 th  century, you get this marked change in temperature and salinity \u2014 it really sticks out,\u201d Dr Tommaso said. As the world\u2019s oceans are warming due to climate change, they say the Arctic Ocean \u2014 the smallest and shallowest of all \u2014 is warming at the fastest rate. Recent studies have pointed out that the Arctic is warming three times more quickly than the planet as a whole with temperatures rising in the region by as much as 3 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is causing ice in the polar region to melt, which in turn raises global sea levels and submerges low-lying parts of the world.  The process creates a feedback loop, where more melting of ice at the pole exposes more of the ocean\u2019s surface to the sun, releasing heat, raising air temperatures, causing more melting, and so on. Recent scientific expeditions have also found that these changes can radically alter the marine ecology of the Arctic Ocean, enabling more fish and microbes in the Atlantic to colonise and adapt to the northern seas. And as the Arctic continues to warm, it would also melt the semi-decomposed permafrost landscape in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Siberia, which stores huge amounts of methane.  The release of this flammable greenhouse gas, which has 80 times more warming power than  carbon dioxide , leads to abnormal temperature rises in the region, also sparking wildfires. \u201cThe rate of warming in the Arctic is more than double the global average, due to feedback mechanisms,\u201d study co-author Francesco Muschitiello from the  University of Cambridge \u2019s Department of Geography said. \u201cBased on satellite measurements, we know that the Arctic Ocean has been steadily warming, in particular over the past 20 years, but we wanted to place the recent warming into a longer context,\u201d Dr Muschitiello said. The scientists said that the connection between the two oceans is capable of shaping Arctic climate variability and could have \u201cimportant implications\u201d for sea-ice retreat and global sea-level rise as the polar ice sheets continued to melt. Based on the analysis, the scientists said this warming of the Arctic has a strong correlation with the slowdown of a natural circulation process in the Labrador Sea \u2014 where the cold air temperatures and the salinity at the surface make the water denser and cause it to sink to the bottom. \u201cIn a future warming scenario, the deep circulation in this sub-polar region is expected to further decrease because of the thawing of the Greenland ice sheet. Our results imply that we might expect further Arctic Atlantification in the future because of climate change,\u201d Dr Muschitiello cautioned. The scientists also called for improved climate models that incorporate these findings to better predict future impacts of climate change. \u201cClimate simulations generally do not reproduce this kind of warming in the Arctic Ocean, meaning there\u2019s an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving Atlantification,\u201d Dr Tommaso explained. \u201cWe rely on these simulations to project future  climate change , but the lack of any signs of an early warming in the Arctic Ocean is a missing piece of the puzzle,\u201d he added.

The climate crisis is not going to unravel how everyone expects  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile A man walks past destroyed residences and businesses in the aftermath of a tornado in the city center of Mayfield, Kentucky, U.S. December 13, 2021 A devastating, disorienting scene has been left in the wake of a powerful tornado outbreak across six states on Friday night. Dozens of people have been killed and nearly 100 more remain unaccounted for. Entire towns were reduced to rubble and twisted wreckage, unrecognizable to those who lived there. Recovery efforts will go on \u201cfor years,\u201d said one public official in Kentucky. The tornadoes were part of a powerful storm system that tore across Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. At least 37 twisters were reported including a monster in Kentucky which traveled a potentially record-breaking 227 miles on the ground. It\u2019s another extreme weather event rounding out a year repeatedly described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d - even as meaning drains from that word amid a calendar packed with deadly wildfires, heatwaves, hurricanes, flash-flooding and prolonged drought. It\u2019s too soon to fully explain the role that global warming played in the tornado outbreak, scientists say. President Joe Biden has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out an assessment. At this early juncture, here\u2019s what\u2019s known: Unusually warm, spring-like weather in December factored into the tornado outbreak.  Recent analysis  found that while all seasons are impacted by climate change, winter is warming the fastest across much of the US, intensifying conditions in the atmosphere which can spawn such tornadoes. Dr Jennifer Marlon, a climate scientist from the Yale School of the Environment, told  CNN  on Monday that the connections are \u201ccomplicated\u201d but that weather events are becoming more severe and more extreme. She later tweeted that the tornado event was \u201cnot just unusual- it was truly historic and deeply shocking\u201d.  \u201cI fear we are poking the climate beast,\u201d she added. Twisters are tricky to study partly because they are relatively short-lived, and tend to appear in rural, less densely- populated areas. For decades, data largely relied on people spotting tornadoes and calling them into the National Weather Service. But the body of research is growing. A  study in 2014  from the National Severe Storms Laboratory found that in the past 50 years, clusters of tornadoes have become more common. A separate 2018  study  found that over the past four decades, \u201cTornado Alley\u201d appears to be shifting to the east, away from typical paths through Kansas and Oklahoma, and to the areas where Friday\u2019s outbreak struck. There have been recent leaps forward in \u201cattribution science\u201d \u2014 which looks at how climate influences extreme weather events. It has become easier, for example, to connect rising global temperatures with the deadly heatwaves in places like Seattle, Jacobabad and Guangdong. It\u2019s also possible to be more definitive on the fingerprint of the climate crisis in severe wildfires, prolonged droughts and the rapid-melting of ice caps that contribute to sea-level rise.  Initiatives like World Weather Attribution, made up of climate scientists from around the world along with disaster relief specialists, are attune to this public need for reliable, rapid analysis when extreme events happen. Within days they were able to link the North American heatwave, and subsequently the severe flooding in western Europe to climate change.  You can find out more about how they go about it here ). Gray areas in a highly-polarized world can be frustrating, particularly in the wake of terrible events which leave a gut-punch reaction that all is not well with our planet. There\u2019s also the enraging fact that being unable to swiftly label such events, which require the methodical process of scientific investigation, leaves a vacuum for climate deniers and delayers to rush into with pious indignation and cries of \u201choax\u201d. \u201cIn the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can\u2019t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? [sic] Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d climate-denier-in-chief Donald Trump  tweeted  in January 2019. (A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appeared to respond with a tweet that read, \u201cwinter storms don\u2019t prove that global warming isn\u2019t happening\u201d and a link to an explainer). In February, a deadly deep freeze which left millions in Texas without power provided right-wing media figures with a two-pronged attack on the climate crisis. The sub-zero temperatures were held up as \u201cevidence\u201d that global warming was no longer of concern while \u201cfrozen wind turbines\u201d were an opportunity to rail against renewable power, and the Green New Deal. (While some wind turbines did freeze, the  Texas Tribune  explained that \u201cfailures in natural gas, coal and nuclear energy systems were responsible for nearly twice as many outages as renewables.) In  The Independent  on Monday,  Skylar Baker-Jordan , a former resident of Bowling Green, Kentucky which suffered tornado damage and loss of life, writes of an equally ugly sentiment. \u201cSome people in the national media have been derisive towards my home state, blaming its people for voting for senators who oppose climate change or disaster relief for other people,\u201d he writes. \u201cA few have insinuated that Kentuckians are reaping what they sowed. That is grossly cynical and so callous it borders on ghoulish.\u201d The climate crisis unravelling to an increasing series of \u201cgotcha\u201d moments can only see us lose much more than is already at stake.

Pregnant women exposed to hazardous environmental conditions are more likely to have babies who are premature, underweight or stillborn, with black mothers and their infants most at risk. The investigation, published on Thursday, is the first to provide \"big picture evidence\" of the links between newborns and climate change in the US population, analysing data on 32.8 million births between 2007 and 2019. The researchers found statistically-significant association between heat, ozone, or fine particulate matter and risk to  pregnancy  outcomes. The report is also further evidence that black and minority communities  disproportionately  bear the brunt of pollution and climate change overall. Black maternal and infant health is already a crisis in the US. Black women are three to four times more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than white women, a  2017 study  found. Black infant mortality is twice as high as for white infants, according to the  CDC . The study was co-authored by Dr Bruce Bekkar, a retired gynaecologist and obstetrician, who is a board member with  Climate Action Campaign  in San Diego; Dr Nathaniel DeNicola, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at George Washington University\u2019s School of Medicine and Health Sciences in DC; Dr Rupa Basu, chief of the air and climate epidemiological section for the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, California, and Dr Susan Pacheco, a paediatric immunologist and allergist, from the University of Texas McGovern Medical School, Houston. Three years ago, the researchers began discussing the lack of \"big picture evidence\" on whether climate change through common exposures was having an effect on pregnancies in the US.  Dr Bekkar told  The Independent: \" I think we all believed that if in fact there was an impact, and we could start to demonstrate that evidence, that people would find it interesting. I think everybody, regardless of their political orientation, cares about what happens to pregnant women and their babies.\" The study deliberately looked at US populations, not because the situation was more important or necessarily worse than elsewhere in the world, but to underscore that the climate crisis should be treated as an issue of urgent concern by Americans.  \"We wanted people to be able to look at this body of data and see that these associations were very strong right here at home. That the pregnant woman down the street, or your daughter that's having a baby, is facing this potential risk,\" Dr Bekkar added. The research team reviewed 68 studies from across the US over the 12-year period which revealed a significant association between air pollution and heat, and birth outcomes. The study was published on  Jama Network Open , part of  Journal of the American Medical Association .  As the climate deteriorates, the findings suggest that there will be increased impacts on the health of infants. Climate change is causing more frequent heat waves and higher temperatures were linked to babies with low birth weights. Four studies also linked increased heat to premature babies, raising the risk from 8.6% to 21%.  Exposure to fine particles, PM2.5, or ozone, typically known as smog, also affected pregnancies. In 19 studies, air pollution was associated with increased risk of preterm birth, that which occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy. Air pollution was linked to low birth weight in 25 studies. One paper linked high exposure to air pollution in the third-trimester with a 42% increased risk of stillbirth. \"The subpopulations at highest risk were persons with asthma and minority groups, especially black mothers,\" the study noted.  Babies born prematurely or with low birth weights can suffer health issues throughout their lives, Dr DeNicola told  The Independent . Early preterm birth can impact foetal brain development which affects the child's cognitive ability. With lungs one of the last organs to fully develop, pre-term babies can be more susceptible to respiratory disease. They can also have underdeveloped immune systems, so infectious diseases present more risk. One study found that for asthmatic mothers the risk of severe preterm birth, of 28 weeks and less, increased by 52%.  \"At 28 weeks and under, the likely impairment to eventual cognitive function is significant,\" Dr DeNicola said. \"And again, especially for asthmatic mothers, they were most at risk for that occurrence with higher pollution exposure.\" Although the new study provides significant cause for alarm, there are steps that pregnant women can take to protect themselves. While they have no control over outdoor temperature or air quality, they may be able to take precautions during heatwaves and make decisions on when to spend time indoors, Dr DeNicola said. \"Any pregnant woman is familiar with Braxton Hicks, false labour contractions, which are primarily driven by dehydration,\" he said. \"This is one more opportunity to discuss additional hydration during certain times of the year and certain heightened exposures.\" If possible, pregnant women can also look at controlling their indoor air quality, Dr DeNicola said, adding that it was one more reason not to smoke or have smokers in the house. There were signs for optimism, the doctors noted, in what overall may be seen as a \"pretty gloomy study\". Dr DeNicola pointed to evidence from California where coal power plants were retired. Over that 10-year period, there was a 20% reduction in the preterm birth rate. Dr Bekkar added: \"What I would hope that this research does going forward is move more into the arena of what people can do with this information, what a pregnant woman and her family can do in terms of protecting themselves from these potential risks. \"Secondly, and in my mind more importantly, what can we all do as families, and as health professionals, to see that the kind of policies that are needed get put in place? With the election in November, and local and state elections, we need to put people in positions of authority that understand these risks and take them seriously. \"The beauty of solving the climate crisis is that even though it's going to take some time, the benefits to health begin to accrue immediately.  \"As we get rid of coal plants and replace them with renewable energy, for instance, the air cleans up. You start not only seeing a reduction in risk to pregnancy but also fewer premature deaths from heart disease and lots of other medical issues.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A joint statement from the UK, Italy, France, Chile and the UN said it noted \u201cwith regret\u201d that the US had formally exited from the agreement, adding that the \u201cscience is clear that we must urgently scale up action and work together to reduce the impacts of global warming\u201d.\r\n Meanwhile, a statement from Japan\u2019s top government spokesman Katsunobu Kato described the US\u2019s exit as \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d. \u201cThe climate change issue isn\u2019t something of a single country, it should be addressed by the entire international community,\u201d he told reporters today.\r\n However, this morning, the path to victory in the US  election  is becoming clearer for  Joe Biden . If elected, Mr Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement, in addition to bringing about a package of measures that would represent the most ambitious climate plan of any US president to date. Earlier today, Mr Biden tweeted: \u201cToday, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it.\u201d A rejoining of the Paris Agreement under a possible Biden administration would send \u201ca very significant signal\u201d to the rest of world, Pete Betts, the former lead climate negotiator for the UK and EU and current fellow of Chatham House, told  The Independent . \u201cIf, as it looks like, it\u2019s Biden, then clearly there will be a boost to momentum on tackling climate change over the next year in particular, but also the next four years,\u201d he said.\r\n \u201cFirst of all, you\u2019ve got the world\u2019s biggest economy and second biggest emitter, who were previously out of the game, needing to put forward an ambitious [climate plan].\r\n \u201cThe second thing is we\u2019ll have the diplomatic weight adding major heft to raise ambition from other countries.\u201d\r\n A key element of Mr Biden\u2019s climate plan is a commitment for the US to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\r\n If Mr Biden is elected, it would mean more than three-fifths of global carbon emissions will be under net-zero targets. \u00a0 It would also mean that the US would follow in the footsteps of other major economies, including Japan, the EU and the UK, which have all already made pledges to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\r\n China, the world\u2019s largest emitter, shocked the world in October when it too announced intentions to reach \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d by 2060. (It is still unclear whether China\u2019s pledge covers all greenhouse gas emissions or only carbon emissions.)\r\n A Biden victory would also see greater diplomatic cooperation on climate between the US and the UK, which is due to host a major UN climate summit, Cop26, in Glasgow in 2021, Mr Betts told  The Independent . \u201cI do think Americans, the Europeans and the UK \u2013 as Cop26 president, will put pressure on allies like Japan, Australia and Canada to raise their game,\u201d he said. Speaking on  Peston  on Wednesday, the UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said there could be clear areas for future collaboration on climate between the UK and the US. \u201cI keep hearing people say: \u2018Well you must prefer it to be one side or the other.\u2019 But as I pointed out there are all sorts of interests which will go one way or the other,\u201d Shapps said.\u00a0 \u201cI mentioned climate change, which is something this government has been absolutely keen to ensure that we\u2019re progressing with things like becoming the first economy in the world to legislate for net zero by 2050, and one can imagine that one of those candidates would be more enthusiastic as president than the other.\u201d However, it is not yet clear if Mr Biden would be able to enact all of his ambitious domestic climate proposals if elected if the Democrats do not take the Senate, says Mr Betts:\r\n \u201cWe all know that there will be challenges in getting ambitious domestic measures through Congress, particularly because it looks like the Democrats haven\u2019t taken the Senate. But there\u2019s still lots of potential for the US administration to take action, in the context of a stimulus bill but also executive action.\u201d\r\n A \u201cstimulus bill\u201d would see Mr Biden join other major economies, such as the EU, in seeking a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d from the coronavirus pandemic. A previous report from the  World Economic Forum  found a global green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could boost the global economy by $10 trillion a year and create 395 million jobs by 2030.

Experts are already concerned about the devastating impact extreme weather can inflict on vital crops, but these conditions also pose subtler hazards. When  drought  strikes, plants like maize, beans and cassava response by flooding themselves with nitrates and hydrogen cyanide \u2013 substances that can be fatal to livestock and humans alike. Further problems arise from the spread of toxin-producing fungal infections under warmer conditions, which are already responsible for thousands of liver cancer cases in Africa every year. While these issues are a particular concern in developing nations with hotter climates, if temperatures rise as scientists predict, they will probably begin to take their toll further north as well. AFP\/Getty  Getty  EPA Getty Getty Getty Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters PA PA PA PA PA Reuters Reuters AP AP Reuters AP AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters AP The alarm was raised by Professor Jacqueline McGlade, a former chief scientist at the United Nations Environment Programme, at a Gresham College lecture in London. Her interest in the problem was first roused when reports emerged from  Ethiopia  of impoverished farmers and their animals dying in mysterious circumstances. The country was in the grip of a drought, but this did not explain the neurological problems that were afflicting these people, including blindness, difficult movements and ultimately death. Researchers working in the area realised the drought had damaged the farmers\u2019 crops, forcing people to consume wild plants they found by the roadside. Unfortunately, the stress of drought had also triggered a defence mechanism inside these plants, flooding them with hydrogen cyanide. Professor McGlade collected all the available information on this topic into a report for the UN back in 2016, in which she and a team of scientists attempted to identify emerging environmental problems.  \u201cWhat I was trying to do was raise issues long before they become embedded as problems \u2013 raising the red flag,\u201d she said. \u201cFast-forward to today and we are talking about climate change \u2013 here is something that is really going to challenge food safety, because the very plants we are relying on are themselves adapting to climate change. \u201cOne of the ways they adapt is dangerous to livestock and humans \u2013 clearly we need to pay attention.\u201d Since her report, the most recent findings from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have laid out the impact of global warming on extreme weather and food systems worldwide.  Scientists think these effects are already being felt, with the extreme  heatwaves  and droughts that struck last year from California to Sweden bringing an associated panic about crops. In the UK, farmers said some vegetable yields had been cut by  as much as half . These problems could be exacerbated as aflatoxin, a substance produced by fungi growing on maize and other crops during drought conditions, spreads beyond its normal range. The European Food Standards Agency has warned the toxin, which is linked to cancer, immune problems and stunted foetal growth, is likely to become a food safety concern in Europe even if the global temperature rise is limited to 2C. Though the outcomes look bleak, Professor McGlade said hope for the future could come from locally grown and wild crop species that have higher tolerance for heat and disease. Dr Carlo Fadda, a researcher at Bioversity International, said he had been working on varieties of barley and durum wheat that has been cultivated in Ethiopia for 4,000 years. \u201cThese varieties are much more tolerant to drought conditions, they maintain relatively good productivity even in bad years and are rarely susceptible to diseases,\u201d he said. By combining these resilient strains with surveillance systems for drought and disease, Professor McGlade said she hoped the worst impact of these toxic crops could be avoided.

Through his own  executive order , the governor authorised state agencies to bring legal challenges to policies implemented by the new president and his administration. \u201cWhen it comes to threats to your jobs, you have a governor who has your back,\u201d Mr Abbott told workers at an oilfield service firm where he signed his order. \u201cTexas is going to protect the oil and gas industry from any type of hostile attack from Washington.\u201d On Wednesday Mr Biden unveiled a series of orders designed to combat climate change that energy producing states see as a threat to their core businesses.  The president made climate change a national security concern, ordered a pause in new oil and gas leases on federal land, and cut subsidies as part of his drive to transition away from fossil fuels. He also directed federal agencies to \u201cprocure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy industries.\u201d  Mr Biden hopes to set the country on a path to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. When Mr Abbott was the state's attorney general during the Obama administration he sued the federal government 31 times \u2014 mostly over environmental legislation and regulation. Ken Paxton , the current attorney general of Texas, has already challenged the new administration by asking a federal judge to temporarily block enforcement of a Department of Homeland Security directive establishing a 100-day halt to most deportations.  \u201cTexas will continue with that litigation strategy to fight back against any efforts by the Biden administration that threaten either the energy sector in general or jobs in the energy sector,\u201d Governor Abbott said. Mr Abbott said the executive order he signed on Thursday calls on \u201cevery state agency to use all lawful powers and tools to challenge any federal action that threatens the strength, vitality or independence of the energy industry in Texas.\u201d  \"This is a homework assignment for every state agency in Texas,\" he added. The governor also plans to prohibit cities in Texas from banning natural gas appliances under a state bill he intends to file. Texas produces more than 40 per cent of the nation's crude oil, and just under a quarter of its natural gas. The oil and gas industry makes up approximately one third of the gross state product. Environmentalists argue that the governor\u2019s order is misguided given the severity of climate change\u2019s impacts on the state from hurricanes, storms, flooding, and extreme heat waves.

The analysis, published on Tuesday, reveals the climate change views of American adults who regularly tune in to each of the major US news networks - CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, the Weather Channel, along with the national nightly news on CBS, ABC or NBC. One in four people who watch Fox News (25 per cent) think global warming isn\u2019t happening but more than half (53 per cent) agree that it is.  However Fox News viewers are divided on the causes of climate change. Almost half (48 per cent) think it is down to environmental changes instead of human-driven factors like burning fossil fuels, vehicle emissions and deforestation.\u00a0 \u201cIn all news audiences except that of Fox News, large majorities think global warming is happening and human-caused,\u201d the authors noted. Despite this only about one in five people in any news audience felt \u201cvery well informed\u201d on the climate crisis, the study found. The majority of viewers who watch CNN, NPR, MSNBC, and nightly network news think the media should be doing more to address global warming, along with a little over half of Weather Channel viewers (51 per cent).\u00a0 Analysis last month by  Media Matters , for example, found that over four days of coverage on the California wildfires, just 13 per cent of cable news segments mentioned the link between the unprecedented blazes and the climate crisis.\u00a0 Climate change and protecting the environment is also likely to factor in the November election. Most people in all viewing audiences say the issues will be important to their vote for president. Most of those watching NPR, MSNBC and CNN were \u201calarmed\u201d or \u201cconcerned\u201d about global warming (more than 80 per cent). Most of those viewers also believe that global warming is already harming people in the US. Fox News regulars reported being \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201ccautious\u201d about climate change (43 per cent) while 36 per cent were \u201cdoubtful or dismissive\u201d.\u00a0 Those who tune into NPR are the most likely to understand the extent of the scientific consensus on climate change - but even then, this is still a minority of the audience.\u00a0 Most viewers underestimate the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming, regardless of who they were tuning into watch. (Some 97 per cent or more of climate scientists agree: climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities,  NASA  reports.) The study was conducted by the Yale program on Climate Change Communication, which examines the public\u2019s attitudes and behaviors towards the climate crisis, both in the US and internationally.\u00a0 The findings are based on data from three national surveys conducted in April 2019, November 2019, and April 2020, involving 3,623 participants.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

He also called on business and political leaders to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the crisis at the Davos summit back in January. The prince has also met teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last month a study suggested the global lockdown will have a \"negligible\" impact on rising temperatures but a green recovery could avert dangerous climate change. Experts led by the University of Leeds found that lockdowns caused a fall in transport use, as well as reductions in industry and commercial operations, cutting the greenhouse gases and pollutants caused by vehicles and other activities. However the impact is only short-lived, with analysis showing that even if some measures last until the end of 2021, global temperatures will only be 0.01C lower than expected by 2030.

The findings are detailed in a report by the Climate Council of Australia (CCA), which says  climate change  is \u201csupercharging extreme weather events, putting Australian lives, our economy and our environment at risk\u201d. By 2040, researchers warn, temperatures of 50C could become commonplace in Sydney and Melbourne unless  global warming  is limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the most ambitious target set under the Paris Agreement. The UN\u2019s  landmark IPCC report  warned humanity now has less than 12 years to achieve this aim, which cannot occur without \u201cunprecedented\u201d change. The hottest temperature on record for Melbourne is 46.4C, logged in February 2009.

Temperatures have already soared to a record 40C this spring, sparking  deadly bushfires  in New South Wales and south Queensland that killed at least six people and up to 1,000 koalas, which are vulnerable to extinction. Fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer, according to the report, with bushfires seen as early as August this year.  \u201cClimate change is supercharging the extreme weather events we are witnessing,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Professor Will Steffen. \u201cWe have seen temperature records smashed, bushfires in winter and a prolonged drought. Climate change is influencing all of these things.\u201d Eastern Australia is currently plagued by drought, said the Climate Council\u2019s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, with no significant rain in sight to dampen its impact on rural and regional communities, farming, water supplies and the natural environment. It is the third year in a row that crops have been threatened by drought, with national summer crop production forecast to fall by 20 per cent to 2.1 million tonnes. \u201cThese heatwaves can have severe effects on human health, including both direct heat illnesses such as heat exhaustion and indirect illnesses such as cardiovascular failure,\u201d said Ms McKenzie. Echoing  a message from UN director general Antonio Guterres  on Monday ahead of the UN\u2019s climate change conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, in which he berated world leaders for their inaction on climate change, the report attacks a decade of \u201crancorous and divisive politics\u201d. \u201cNowhere is this tension between the need for urgent action and  ideologically driven\u200b denial  and inaction more evident than in Australia,\u201d Professor Steffen writes. \u201cAt the end of the \u2018critical decade\u2019, and after a decade of rancorous and divisive federal politics, we have no credible pathway for reducing emissions in our economy over the next two-three decades. In short, there is no leadership, no national plan, no vision, and no coherent policies.\u201d But referencing the country\u2019s large-scale transition to renewable energy, and adoption of a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045 in the capital region, the report concludes that urgent action is now needed to avoid some of the more potent effects of climate change. \u201cFortunately, there are many Australians working at the sub-national level who are showing that \u2018the impossible\u2019 is not only achievable, it is also desirable and is happening much faster than many thought possible,\u201d it states.

Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of people believe politicians are not discussing the issue of climate change enough in the run up to the next national vote, the poll for environmental lawyers ClientEarth found. Against a backdrop of protests by Extinction Rebellion and school strikers calling for urgent efforts to tackle rising temperatures, seven in 10 people think the climate emergency demands swifter action. Some 58 per cent say the government is not doing enough on the issue, and there is also pressure on investors, with three in five (59 per cent) believing financial institutions and banks should no longer invest in fossil fuels.  The top priorities people had for the government to limit further climate change were planting trees, making homes more energy-efficient and investing more into renewable energy, according to the poll of more than 2,000 people.

And more than half think the UK is already experiencing the impacts of climate change including more extreme weather, hotter and longer heatwaves, sea level rises and storm surges, increased flooding, air pollution and species extinction. A majority also think climate change is also causing political instability in the UK. The government should also do more to drive the use of low-emission vehicles such as electric cars, according to 61 per cent of those quizzed. ClientEarth lawyer Jonathan Church said: \u201cFrom the student strikes to Extinction Rebellion, people across the UK are demanding greater action to address the climate crisis. \u201cImportantly these demands appear strong enough to make a difference at the next election, with more than half of adults saying that climate change will impact how they cast their vote.\u201d Additional reporting by PA Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

According to data released on Monday by  NASA , the global average temperature was 0.93C above the June norm (based on a 1951-to-1980 baseline), easily breaking the previous June record of 0.82C above the average, set in 2016. The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets. Notably, 13 locations in France  surpassed their highest temperature  ever recorded. The heat wave\u2019s highest temperature of 45.9C, posted in Gallargues-le-Montueux, was 1.8C above the old record, set during an infamous heat wave in July and August 2003.

June featured unusually mild conditions in the Arctic, particularly in Greenland, where the melt season got off to an early start. July is picking up right where June left off. Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist based in Berkeley, California, tweeted that the month so far ranks as the hottest on record narrowly ahead of 2017, the previous record holder. \u201cIf this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth!\u201d tweeted Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. Like June, July has featured some notable high-temperature extremes, including in Nunavut, Canada, the northernmost permanently inhabited location on Earth. It hit a record high of 21C on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 20C. In addition, Alaska last week posted its hottest two days on record, highlighted by a temperature of 32.2C in Anchorage for the first time. The June monthly record and July\u2019s toasty first half raises the odds that 2019 could make a run for a top-three finish for warmest year, rather than top five. According to data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, a trend that scientists have tied mainly to human emissions of greenhouse gases.

Some 13 species including corn buntings, goldcrests and long-tailed tits saw their populations increase by at least 10 per cent as a result of changing climatic conditions, according to the study by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and government conservation agency Natural England. Warmer temperatures probably have a positive effect on resident species by improving survival rates over the winter, the researchers wrote in a  paper  published in the journal  Bird Study . \u201cPopulations of a range of resident bird species are probably significantly greater than they would otherwise have been in the absence of climate change,\u201d researchers wrote.  Overall climate change is affecting the populations of around one-third of English breeding  birds . Of 68 species monitored between 1966 and 2015, 24 showed evidence that changes in their population were linked to temperature or rainfall. Nineteen out of 24 of those birds were being helped \u2013 as opposed to hindered \u2013 by climate change. RSPB RSPB RSPB RSPB RSPB However, scientists warn that further warming could prove more disruptive.  Three species \u2013 cuckoos, little owls and reed warblers \u2013 saw numbers fall by at least 10 per cent as a result of climate change, the study found.  And some species which have seen long-term population declines over the period studied, but which prefer warmer conditions, such as farmland birds including the corn bunting and grey partridge, may have seen less significant falls than they would have done without climate change, the study suggests. The data used in the study comes from the BTO, the government\u2019s Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the  RSPB \u2019s breeding bird survey, whose fieldwork is conducted by volunteers. This was compared with changes in the climate in terms of seasonal temperatures and rainfall. James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the BTO and the paper\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cGiven the changeable British weather, it can be difficult for us to see the long-term impacts of climate change, but by monitoring bird populations we can track impacts upon the natural environment. \u201cThanks to the efforts of our volunteer bird surveyors who have been counting birds in England for over 50 years, we can show that climate change is already affecting about one-third of breeding bird populations monitored. \u201cWhilst some of these impacts have resulted in population increases, as harsh winters which naturally limit the populations of some resident species have become less common through time, there are also species which appear to have declined too.\u201d Additional reporting by PA  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Naomi Seibt  began uploading videos to YouTube last year, with titles such as \u201cClimate change \u2013 just hot air?\u201d, \u201cFierce without Feminism\u201d, and \u201cMessage to the Media \u2013 HOW DARE YOU?\u201d. Her stance on the climate apparently caught the attention of The Heartland Institute, a US think tank based in Chicago, which has previously lobbied on behalf of tobacco firms, supports fracking and rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. The organisation, which reportedly \u201chas the ear of the Trump administration\u201d, and held its 2019 International Conference on Climate Change at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, recently hired Ms Seibt as the face of its climate denial campaign.  In  a video  put out by the Heartland Institute, titled \u201cNaomi Seibt vs Greta Thunberg: Whom Should We Trust?\u201d, Ms Seibt begins: \u201cScience is entirely based on intellectual humility and it is important that we keep questioning the narrative that it out there instead of promoting it, and these days climate change science really isn\u2019t science at all.\u201d Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty In between cuts from footage of Thunberg\u2019s 2019 address to the UN in New York, Ms Seibt says: \u201cClimate change alarmism at its very core is a despicably anti-human ideology\u201d.  In an interview in the video, Ms Seibt says she rejects being called a \u201cclimate denier\u201d, because she says \u201cespecially as a German, it is so rude to refer to someone as a climate denier because obviously there is a connection to the term \u2018holocaust denier\u2019, which carries a lot of weight in Germany.\u201d In the blurb on its video, the institute decries Thunberg\u2019s \u201cdoomsday climate predictions\u201d and describes Ms Seibt as \u201ca rising star\u201d, who \u201cadvocates for proper scientific discourse over climate change.\u201d  The Heartland Institute\u2019s support and promotion of Seibt has set alarm bells ringing.  While Ms Thunberg has become a global phenomenon, winning support from concerned people across the world, and becoming Time magazine\u2019s person of the year, those remaining groups and individuals threatened by the weight of climate science appear to believe Ms Seibt is some sort of opposition figure who can inspire people through similar means. \u201cShe\u2019s a fantastic voice for free markets and for climate realism,\u201d James Taylor, director of the Arthur B Robinson Centre for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute, told  The Washington Post .  But while The Heartland Institute is \u201cone of the most notorious climate change denial groups in the United States\u201d \u2013 according to environment  website DeSmog UK , Ms Seibt has not made a case for outright denial of the climate crisis. In a video  published this month , Ms Seibt instead argues the scientists have overstated the impact of emissions on the planet\u2019s climate, and she also asks if researchers have considered the \u201cimmense impact that the sun has on the climate in comparison to CO2 emissions.\u201d After reinterpreting the scientific data for a live audience to indicate CO2 emissions are not much to worry about, she then adds: \u201cWe must not make ourselves the victim of a tight tax corset\u201d, adding, \u201cwe must not deny ourselves, or the people from awfully poor third world countries access to cheap and reliable energy.\u201d Her videos are accumulating tens of thousands of views, and together with reams of positive comments below, it is clear Ms Seibt is striking a chord with many. The overall message \u2013 one which is being facilitated by a right-wing think tank \u2013 is that business as usual is fine. She also aims to undermine existing efforts to combat climate change by suggesting activists deserve pity rather than anger. \u201cRage and panic belong to our opponents,\u201d she says. In an earlier jibe at Ms Thunberg, Ms Seibt says: \u201cDo not create an ideology out of something that a young girl has to say. Regardless of the political side she\u2019s on.\u201d But while Ms Thunberg is merely hammering home the science \u2013 that 97 per cent of peer-reviewed climate studies agree with the scientific consensus that manmade global warming is real \u2013 Ms Seibt appears to have more interest in ideology.  Alongside her interest in climate denial, she has voiced concerns about immigration and feminism, and has previously spoken at events run by Germany\u2019s far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Millions worldwide at growing risk of flooding, researchers warn Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting at a rate which matches climate scientists\u2019 worst-case scenario forecasts and has raised the global sea level by 1.8cm in the past two decades. Sea levels will rise by a further 17cm and put 16 million people at risk of yearly coastal flooding if global warming continues apace, British and Danish researchers warned. Melting of ice in Greenland has pushed the world\u2019s oceans up by 10.6mm since the sheets were first monitored by satellite in the 1990s, while Antarctic ice has contributed a further 7.2mm, according to a study by scientists at the University of Leeds and the Danish Meteorological Institute. The latest measurements show the world\u2019s seas are now rising by 4mm each year. \u201cAlthough we anticipated the ice sheets would lose increasing amounts of ice in response to the warming of the oceans and atmosphere, the rate at which they are melting has accelerated faster than we could have imagined,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Tom Slater, a climate researcher at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds. \u201cThe melting is overtaking the climate models we use to guide us, and we are in danger of being unprepared for the risks posed by sea level rise,\u201d he added. The study, published in the journal  Nature Climate Change , compares the latest results from satellite surveys of ice sheet mass with calculations from climate models. The authors warn the sheets are losing ice at the worst-case rate forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC.) Anna Hogg, study co-author and climate researcher at Leeds university\u2019s School of Earth and Environment at Leeds, said: \u201cIf ice sheet losses continue to track our worst-case climate warming scenarios we should expect an additional 17cm of sea level rise from the ice sheets alone. That\u2019s enough to double the frequency of storm-surge flooding in many of the world\u2019s largest coastal cities.\u201d Global sea levels have historically mostly increased due to a mechanism called thermal expansion, which means that volume of seawater expands as it gets warmer. But in the last five years, water from the melting ice sheets and mountain glaciers has become the main cause of the rising oceans. Greenland lost one million tonnes of ice for every minute of 2019, generating enough water to cover the US state of California in more than four feet of water, according to  a study  published last month. But Ruth Mottram, climate researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute, said: \u201cIt is not only Antarctica and Greenland that are causing the water to rise. In recent years, thousands of smaller glaciers have begun to melt or disappear altogether, as we saw with the glacier Ok in Iceland, which was declared \u2018dead\u2019 in 2014. This means that melting of ice has now taken over as the main contributor of sea level rise. \u201c A separate study  published last week by US researchers warned global warming threatened to rapidly destroy Antarctic ice shelves with \u201chuge implications for sea level\u201d. Rising temperatures could push meltwater into fractures in the shelves\u2019 surface, making them vulnerable to collapse, warned scientists at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The worst-case scenario is \u201clots of places will be covered by lots and lots of water by the end of the century\u201d, said glaciologist and study author Jonathan Kingslake.

Here is the transcript Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile My name is  Greta Thunberg , I am 16 years old and I\u2019m from Sweden. I am grateful for being with you here in the USA. A nation that, to many people, is the country of dreams. I also have a dream: that governments, political parties and corporations grasp the urgency of the climate and ecological crisis and come together despite their differences \u2013 as you would in an emergency \u2013 and take the measures required to safeguard the conditions for a dignified life for everybody on earth. Because then \u2013 we millions of school striking youth \u2013 could go back to school. I have a dream that the people in power, as well as the media, start treating this crisis like the existential emergency it is. So that I could go home to my sister and my dogs. Because I miss them. In fact I have many dreams. But this is the year 2019. This is not the time and place for dreams. This is the time to wake up. This is the moment in history when we need to be wide awake. And yes, we need dreams, we can not live without dreams. But there\u2019s a time and place for everything. And dreams can not stand in the way of telling it like it is. Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters PA AFP\/Getty  Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty AFP\/Getty And yet, wherever I go I seem to be surrounded by fairytales. Business leaders, elected officials all across the political spectrum spending their time making up and telling bedtime stories that soothe us, that make us go back to sleep. These are \u201cfeel-good\u201d stories about how we are going to fix everything. How wonderful everything is going to be when we have \u201csolved\u201d everything. But the problem we are facing is not that we lack the ability to dream, or to imagine a better world. The problem now is that we need to wake up. It\u2019s time to face the reality, the facts, the science. And the science doesn\u2019t mainly speak of \u201cgreat opportunities to create the society we always wanted\u201d. It tells of unspoken human sufferings, which will get worse and worse the longer we delay action \u2013 unless we start to act now. And yes, of course a sustainable transformed world will include lots of new benefits. But you have to understand. This is not primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new businesses or green economic growth. This is above all an emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. And we need to treat it accordingly so that people can understand and grasp the urgency. Because you can not solve a crisis without treating it as one. Stop telling people that everything will be fine when in fact, as it looks now, it won\u2019t be very fine. This is not something you can package and sell or \u201dlike\u201d on social media. Stop pretending that you, your business idea, your political party or plan will solve everything. We must realise that we don\u2019t have all the solutions yet. Far from it. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things. Changing one disastrous energy source for a slightly less disastrous one is not progress. Exporting our emissions overseas is not reducing our emission. Creative accounting will not help us. In fact, it\u2019s the very heart of the problem. Some of you may have heard that we have 12 years as from 1 January 2018 to cut our emissions of carbon dioxide in half. But I guess that hardly any of you have heard that there is a 50 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degree Celsius of global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. Fifty per cent chance. And these current, best available scientific calculations do not include non linear tipping points as well as most unforeseen feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost. Or already locked in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Or the aspect of equity; climate justice. So a 50 per cent chance \u2013 a statistical flip of a coin \u2013 will most definitely not be enough. That would be impossible to morally defend. Would anyone of you step onto a plane if you knew it had more than a 50 per cent chance of crashing? More to the point: would you put your children on that flight? And why is it so important to stay below the 1.5 degree limit? Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilising the climate, so that we stay clear of setting off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control. Even at 1 degree of warming we are seeing an unacceptable loss of life and livelihoods. So where do we begin? Well I would suggest that we start looking at chapter 2, on page 108 in the IPCC report that came out last year. Right there it says that if we are to have a 67 per cent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we had, on 1 January 2018, about 420 Gtonnes of CO2 left to emit in that carbon dioxide budget. And of course that number is much lower today. As we emit about 42 Gtonnes of CO2 every year, if you include land use. With today\u2019s emissions levels, that remaining budget is gone within less than 8 and a half years. These numbers are not my opinions. They aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s opinions or political views. This is the current best available science. Though a great number of scientists suggest even these figures are too moderate, these are the ones that have been accepted by all nations through the IPCC. And please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to zero emissions much faster, so that people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living, by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built. Such as roads, hospitals, schools, clean drinking water and electricity. The USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history. It is also the world\u2019s number one producer of oil. And yet, you are also the only nation in the world that has signalled your strong intention to leave the Paris Agreement. Because quote \u201cit was a bad deal for the USA\u201d. Four-hundred and twenty Gt of CO2 left to emit on 1 January 2018 to have a 67 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise. Now that figure is already down to less than 360 Gt. These numbers are very uncomfortable. But people have the right to know. And the vast majority of us have no idea these numbers even exist. In fact not even the journalists that I meet seem to know that they even exist. Not to mention the politicians. And yet they all seem so certain that their political plan will solve the entire crisis. But how can we solve a problem that we don\u2019t even fully understand? How can we leave out the full picture and the current best available science? I believe there is a huge danger in doing so. And no matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow this to continue to be a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy now is physics. And we can not make \u201cdeals\u201d with physics. Everybody says that making sacrifices for the survival of the biosphere \u2013 and to secure the living conditions for future and present generations \u2013 is an impossible thing to do. Americans have indeed made great sacrifices to overcome terrible odds before. Think of the brave soldiers that rushed ashore in that first wave on Omaha Beach on D Day. Think of Martin Luther King and the 600 other civil rights leaders who risked everything to march from Selma to Montgomery. Think of President John F. Kennedy announcing in 1962 that America would \u201cchoose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard\u2026\u201d Perhaps it is impossible. But looking at those numbers \u2013 looking at the current best available science signed by every nation \u2013 then I think that is precisely what we are up against. But you must not spend all of your time dreaming, or see this as some political fight to win. And you must not gamble your children\u2019s future on the flip of a coin. Instead, you must unite behind the science. You must take action. You must do the impossible. Because giving up can never ever be an option.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Scientists have released what can be seen as  the most urgent and far-reaching call yet  for world governments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and stop global warming. They warn of dying corals, melting sea ice and rising sea levels. These effects are inevitable with any level of global warming, but the conclusion of the report is that they will be far worse if the temperature increase is 2C, compared to a more ambitious target of 1.5C. The report is the result of years of research and then a week of frantic negotiations between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea. But what exactly does the report say, and what does it mean for the global community? Its goal was to gather together all the available scientific literature and produce a report that laid out two future scenarios. One in which the Earth\u2019s average temperature was allowed to increase by 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures (since around 1850), and one in which it increased by 2C. The report has taken over two years to produce and included the assessment of more than 6,000 scientific studies.  The point was to create a document that could help those in power with their efforts to ward off  climate change  and support sustainable economic development while also eradicating poverty.  The report was commissioned by the United Nations (UN) after the  Paris climate agreement  in 2015.  At the time, a coalition of rich and poor nations pushed for a commitment to \u201cpursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\u201d as well as the \u201cwell below\u201d 2C target set by the agreement. The UN then asked its scientific body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to get to work finding out what this stretch goal would mean, and how it could be achieved. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Things are not looking good. We are on track to reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 if temperatures continues to increase at the current rate, and 3C by the end of the century. Once we hit 2C warming, the world will be a profoundly different place. There will be almost no coral reefs remaining, the Arctic will be completely devoid of ice during summer at least once a decade, and huge numbers of animals and plants will become extinct as their habitat becomes smaller and smaller. The impact for humans will be enormous, particularly in areas already vulnerable such as the low-lying coastal regions of Bangladesh and Vietnam, and island territories like Kiribati and the Maldives. Sea level rise will drive millions from their homes, and crop yields will fall dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. Yes, but it\u2019s going to take serious effort at every level of society. The researchers behind the report used words like \u201cunprecedented\u201d to describe the kind of changes that will need to take place if we are going to stay below the 1.5C target. Fossil fuel consumption is the main producer of greenhouse gases, so this is the sector that will need to see the biggest changes. CO2 emissions must be cut by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 to curb warming at 1.5C. By 2050 we need to be at \u201cnet zero\u201d, meaning any remaining CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere needs to be sucked back out somehow.  This will mean planting lots of trees, and also investing in technologies that capture carbon from the air and store it somehow. Most of these technologies are still essentially experimental, meaning relying on them too heavily could be risky. In most pathways to a 1.5C future, renewable energy sources are expected to supply up to 85 per cent of our electricity needs by 2050. This may ruffle some feathers as even in nations that have committed strongly to tackling climate change, such as the UK and Germany, fossil fuel extraction is still well underway. The authors concluded that \u201climiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d, and this apparently means individuals as well.  Some of these changes will be partly top-down, such as a move away from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. Governments can ease this transition by incentivising people to switch to cleaner vehicles, but there is no doubt that this will be a massive and noticeable change in the next couple of decades if the IPCC warnings are taken seriously. Other points from the report can be interpreted as affecting people on a more personal level. The move towards \u201cless resource-intensive diets\u201d, for example, will likely entail eating less meat \u2013 something not everyone will be pleased to hear. Not necessarily the report itself, but the Summary for Policymakers \u2013 a 33-page document which was the subject of most media reports \u2013 has drawn some criticism. The summary is the result of a week of negotiations with government representatives, while the report is a purely scientific document. As a result, there have been accusations levelled by some that despite its apocalyptic warnings, the summary has been somewhat watered down to appease governments. There were reports of pushback by Saudi Arabia and the US during the negotiations, for example.  However, broadly speaking the report\u2019s conclusions are clear, and should be suitably dramatic to encourage politicians to take serious action to tackle climate change. This report will set the agenda for climate change in the immediate future. The UN is holding climate talks in Katowice, Poland, in December, that are meant to establish rules based on the Paris climate targets that will guide governments' efforts to cut emissions and avert disaster.

As global temperatures rise well above their seasonal averages, especially in the northern hemisphere, the sea ice in the Arctic continues its overall downward trajectory with a new record monthly low for a February. While some of the temperature rise has been put down to the large El Nino event currently coming to an end in the Pacific Ocean, scientists repeated their warnings that the global climate system is now being strongly influenced by human emissions of greenhouse gases, especially by the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. February was the warmest month on record, and 2016 is heading to become the warmest year on record, warmer even than 2015 which had itself set a clear record over previous warmest years, according to the global surface temperature measurements compiled and released by Nasa. Nasa confirmed that February 2016 was not only the warmest month ever measured globally, at 1.35C above the long-term average, but that it was more than 0.2C warmer than January 2016, which itself had held the previous monthly temperature record. Gavin Schmidt, the director of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, said on Twitter than he does not normally comment on individual months because there is \u201ctoo much weather, not enough climate\u201d but last month was \u201cspecial\u201d. He summarised his reaction to the data simply with: \u201cWow\u201d. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere especially saw temperature rise well above the global average, with the Arctic and northern Russia seeing exceptionally warm surface readings over land and sea. The US National Snow and Ice Data Centre reported that the sea ice in the Arctic in February had once again failed to reform completely, leaving large patches of open ocean which in previous years had been topped with ice. The extent of the sea ice in February was the lowest in the satellite record going back to the 1970s, for the second month in a row. This suggests a new record for winter sea ice will be reached in March \u2013 underling how higher temperatures are affecting both Arctic winters as well as summers. Click HERE for larger annotated version of the graphic European researchers, under the Copernicus Climate Service, using a slightly different method of analysing the surface temperature data than Nasa, also found that February 2016 was by far the warmest month on record.  It found for instance that February was more than 5C above the 1981-2010 average for the month over a region stretching from Finland to Greece and extending eastwards to western Siberia, Kazakhstan and the northern part of the Middle East. In parts of north-west Russia and the Barents Sea, temperatures peaked at more than 10C above average. \u201cFebruary 2016 was the most exceptional month yet in a spell of exceptional months. Globally, the average temperature for the month was: 0.86C above the February average for 1981-2010; almost 0.5C higher than the previous highest February value of 0.37C, which was reached in both 2010 and 2015,\u201d the service said. Professor Phil Jones of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia said that the global temperature figures for February were remarkable given that January was itself such a clear monthly record. The lack of sea ice may have played a role, he suggested. \u201cFebruary 2016 is by far and away the warmest month yet recorded. Part of the warmth was due to the ongoing El Nino event in the Pacific, but the greater part is down to the anomalously warm temperatures in many mid- and high-latitude areas of the Northern Hemisphere,\u201c Professor Jones said. \u201cIn particular, the record low sea ice area in the Arctic has led to anomalously warm temperatures north of Scandinavia and western Russia,\u201d he said. Reuters Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Reuters Reuters Reuters ALAIN JOCARD\/AFP\/Getty Images Reuters Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThis is a pretty big jump between January and February, although this data from Nasa is only the first set of global temperature data. We will need to see what the figures from NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] and the Met Office say, which we will expect in the next few days. \u201cThis is what we would expect, given the big El Nino event that is currently occurring in the Pacific. We expect to see global averages to remain very warm for the next few months before a slight drop in monthly temperatures towards the end of the year,\u201d Dr Hawkins said. \u201cThis is in line with our expectations that due to the continuing effect of greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the effects of El Nino on top, 2016 is likely to beat 2015 as the warmest year on record,\u201d he said.

Just weeks before the Cop26 climate conference started scientists and medical professionals warned that unless urgent action is taken to prevent climate change it could have wide-ranging consequences for health outcomes. The World Health Organisation (WHO) released a report arguing that the burning of fossil fuels \u201cis killing us\u201d and that climate change \u201cis the biggest single threat to humanity\u201d. The report added that climate change is leading to death and illness from increasingly extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods, disruptions to food systems, increases in disease spread and mental health issues. In Canada, this week a doctor suffering from breathing issues has been the first patient worldwide suffering from \u2018climate change\u2019, as his symptoms were due to poor air quality and heatwaves. Below we explore the impact of climate change on global health. From extreme heat to worsening hunger and water shortages, accelerating climate change will have a far reaching impact on health, experts have said. The WHO estimates that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause around 250, 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. A lot of these deaths are linked to the occurrence of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and storms, that disrupt food systems and also cause various illnesses. Andy Haines, a professor of environmental change and public health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Cop26 that climate change is already driving diverse health threats around the world. For example, the ranges of insect-carried diseases such as malaria and dengue are altering as weather patterns shift, and heat deaths are swiftly rising, with over a third of those recorded from 1990-2018 attributed to climate change, he said. The rising toll of wildfires, floods, droughts and extreme heat have hit the headlines in recent years and have a torrid impact on our physical health. But these events are also having \u201creally devastating effects\u201d on mental health, alongside worries among many people about the future under worsening climate change, Haines added. As permafrost melts in the fast-warming Arctic, it could even expose \u201cMethuselah organisms\u201d - long frozen and potentially deadly bacteria and viruses, he said. \u201cAs we release these we don\u2019t know what is going to happen to human health,\u201d he added. But some health risks connected to climate change are already well known. Air pollution, much of it connected to the use of fossil fuels, kills about 7 million people a year. Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella died in London in 2013 of a severe asthma attack that coroners attributed to \u201cexcess air pollution\u201d, told conference participants that \u201cbreathing clean air is a human right\u201d. And in places such as New Delhi, Beijing and Lahore, impenetrable smogs have descended upon the cities, causing severe breathing problems to residents. The root cause of smog is often the burning of fossil fuels. A number of changes have already been proposed at Cop26, including making cycling and walking easier in cities, to altering diets and ramping up renewable energy. Adding more trees and water-absorbing green areas of lower income areas of cities could be actioned to address inequalities, flooding and heat risks. \u201cThe solutions are the same for the climate, our health and biodiversity,\u201d said Rayan Kassem, West Asia regional director for Youth4Nature, a green non-profit focused on climate and nature solutions. The aforementioned WHO report suggested that governments need to commit to a green, healthy recovery from the pandemic, making sure efforts are aligned to the goals of the global Paris Agreement on tackling climate change. It adds that the recovery should focus on 100% green stimulus spending and end fossil fuel subsidies. It also calls for for action to address inequalities at the root of the current climate and health crises. The report lays out further recommendations to deal with climate change, including promoting sustainable and healthy cities, restoring nature, and moving to an economy based more on wellbeing. The NHS could save \u00a317 billion over 20 years if ministers push for a change towards greener transport, according to a report published by the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Royal Society. The authors state that if city residents of England and Wales walked an average of 1km more and cycled an average of 3km further each day, the number of patients suffering heart disease, strokes and diabetes due to inactivity would be dramatically reduced. They said this would alleviate pressure on the healthcare system, saving it the projected \u00a317 billion, while also reducing pollution levels as more people opt to walk instead of drive. Professor Joanna Haigh CBE told a press briefing in mid-October she hoped the report she co-chaired would provide \u201csignificant motivation for Government action on climate change\u201c. The report gives the example of reducing deaths from air pollution, which currently causes up to 36,000 premature deaths a year, as health issue which should incentivise the Government to phase out fossil fuels. Better insulating in homes would also prevent deaths linked to low temperatures - which account for up to 50,000 fatalities a year, the authors said. Professor Sir Andy Haines, who also co-chaired the report, said tackling climate change is likely to reduce health inequalities. He said: \u201cOur report gives many \u2018win-win\u2019 examples of actions that would have a positive impact on health and the climate. \u201cMany of the measures, such as improved public transport access and energy efficient housing, could also help decrease health inequalities.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The study, conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, involved the analysis of 40 years of global climate data, in an effort to find out how many observable effects of climate change - such as melting glaciers, droughts and dwindling ocean ecosystems - could be  attributed to man-made emissions , rather than natural causes. Published in the high-profile  Nature Climate Change  journal, the study found that the blame for two-thirds of the impacts related to rising temperatures can be \"confidently\" pinned on humans. Explaining the significance of the study, Gerrit Hansen from the Potsdam Institute said: \"Previous analyses linking observed impacts to climate change have been generic in nature, addressing whether there is an influence of human-related warming on impacts globally, without an inference to individual impacts.\" His study was different because it looked at the role of man-made emissions in individual issues caused by climate change, which included glacier retreat, droughts, coastal erosion, wildfires, falling food production and negative effects on human livelihoods and health. Humanity's contribution to these issues varies across the world, as illustrated by a map released with the study. For example, it says the researchers only had 'low' confidence levels in attributing the decline of marine ecosystems off the coast of northern South America to man-made emissions, while further north in the Caribbean sea, they were 'very confident' that the same issue was being made worse by human activity. Other issues that scientists were sure could be attributed to humans included wildfires in southern Europe, melting glaciers in North America, and droughts in central Asia. They also said there was a 'medium' chance that significant threats to livelihoods, health and the economy posed by  climate change in the UK  are linked to human emissions. Not only does the study give us a snapshot of how the planet is coping with human emissions, it could be vital to better predicting the future impacts of a warming global climate. Wolfgang Cramer, from the Mediterranean Institute for Marine and Terrestrial Biodiversity in France, told  EurekAlert : \"It is crucial that we continue to develop and maintain observational efforts around the world in order to continue documenting how the world is responding to our greenhouse emissions, as well as to agreed reductions in those emissions.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Just as it is with a plane crash, so it is with global heating. Changes in the  climate  don\u2019t in themselves represent a significant risk  \u2013  the Earth\u2019s climate has been changing for billions of years after all  \u2013  but it is the abrupt changes that could spell disaster for us.  New research  suggests that climate models which predict greater  global warming  in the future also have more volatile warming trends. If that is the case, and the climate is as sensitive to our carbon dioxide emissions as many of the latest models suggest, this will seriously threaten our ability to adapt. And it is that which will put a significant fraction of humanity in jeopardy.  Many scientists focus on how much warmer the Earth\u2019s climate will become because of the extra carbon dioxide humans have put into the atmosphere. The technical term for this is   Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity  (ECS). Equilibrium because it takes years, decades or centuries for the climate system to respond to extra heating.  Think how much energy it takes to heat a bathtub full of water and how long it can stay warm for. The amount of energy required to heat the trillions of litres of the Earth\u2019s oceans is enormous.  Consider that bath of water again. Imagine the tap is dripping because it\u2019s not entirely closed, so the water level in the bath is increasing, but only very slowly. Trying to track changes in water level just by eye would be as difficult as seeing the march of time in the hour hand of a watch. Now picture someone is in the bath. Unless the person stays absolutely still, they will have an impact on the water level as their movements will make waves. Depending on how much they move, these waves can be plain to see and would easily mask the very slow water level increase.  The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty ECS tells us where the climate system will end up \u2013 what the final water level will be. But it may not tell us a great deal about how we will get there. Will we have a smooth increase or a much bumpier ride? How much will the climate fluctuate as it responds to being heated up? How big will the \u201cwaves\u201d in temperatures be? These are the answers that this recent research has addressed and why on reading it my first response was \u201cOh no. This isn\u2019t good\u201d. Because what the team lead by  University of Exeter  PhD researcher   Femke Nijsse  found, is that more sensitive climates have higher fluctuations. Using extensive climate simulations, they discovered that if a climate system reacts strongly to increased greenhouse gases, then it is also more likely to have decades when temperatures are much higher or sometimes much lower than the longer-term average. In fact, more sensitive climates may have a run of years that are cooler than less sensitive climates. But these cooler years are masking the underlying behaviour of the system. As natural variations move in the other direction, they can conspire with the sensitive climate to unleash a period of supercharged heating. OK, but why should we be worried about that? Because the warming trend of the Earth\u2019s real climate between 2002-2012 was a bit less than what it should have been given how much we have been increasing greenhouse gases. Some people leapt at that as being evidence that the climate is less sensitive than was initially feared. They argued we shouldn\u2019t decarbonise too rapidly, or even at all, because there is no urgency to do so. But this period of depressed warming is consistent with the Earth\u2019s climate having higher fluctuations. What this means is that at some point in the future we may see temperatures swing across to much faster warming trends. This period of hyper-warming could swamp whatever adaptation measures we are currently putting in place.  When in the future? Perhaps now, as witnessed by the near continual breaking of temperature records around the world and much faster rates of glacier retreat than expected. Rather than a brief anomaly, this may be the beginning of an acceleration of global heating; an acceleration of a trend that is already greater than any warming trend for the past 2000 years. Exploring the relationship between sensitivity and fluctuations is very complex, and no single study can be considered to provide the last word on the matter. But this new research has kicked away another support against the collapse into despair about how we are affecting the climate.  Because, remember, it\u2019s not the fall, but the sudden stop. And the mess our civilisation will make if  climate change  sends us plummeting hard and fast to the floor will not be pretty.

Human activities leave too many dead satellites and fragments of machinery discarded in Earth orbit. If left unchecked, space junk could pose significant problems for future generations \u2014 rendering access to space increasingly difficult, or at worst, impossible. Yet the two may come to be linked. Our planet\u2019s atmosphere naturally pulls orbiting debris downward and incinerates it in the thicker lower atmosphere, but increasing carbon dioxide levels are lowering the density of the upper atmosphere, which may diminish this effect. A study presented last month at the European conference on space debris says that the problem has been underestimated, and that the amount of space junk in orbit could, in a worst case scenario, increase 50 times by 2100. \u201cThe numbers took us by surprise,\u201d said Hugh Lewis, a space debris expert from the University of Southampton and a co-author on the paper, which will be submitted for peer review in the coming months. \u201cThere is genuine cause for alarm.\u201d Our atmosphere is a useful ally in clearing up space junk. Collisions with its molecules cause drag, pulling objects back into the atmosphere. Below 300 miles above the Earth's surface, most objects will naturally decay into the thicker lower atmosphere and burn up in less than 10 years. In the lower atmosphere, carbon dioxide molecules can rerelease infrared radiation after absorbing it from the sun, which is then trapped by the thick atmosphere as heat. But above 60 miles where the atmosphere is thinner, the opposite is true. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to recapture that energy,\u201d said Matthew Brown, also from the University of Southampton and the paper\u2019s lead author. \u201cSo it gets lost into space.\u201d The escape of heat causes the volume of the atmosphere, and thus its density, to decrease. Since 2000, Brown and his team say the atmosphere at 250 miles has lost 21 per cent of its density because of rising carbon dioxide levels. By 2100, if carbon dioxide levels double their current levels \u2014 in line with the worst case scenario assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2014 that number could rise to 80 per cent. Since 2000, Brown and his team say the atmosphere at 250 miles has lost 21 per cent of its density because of rising carbon dioxide levels For space junk, the implications are stark. More than 2,500 objects larger than four inches in size currently orbit at or below an altitude of 250 miles. In the worst-case scenario, increased orbital lifetimes of up to 40 years would mean fewer items are dragged into the lower atmosphere. Objects at this altitude would proliferate by 50 times to about 125,000. Even in a best-case scenario, where carbon dioxide levels stabilise or even reverse, the amount of space junk would still be expected to double. Brown thinks a more probable outcome is somewhere in between, perhaps a 10 times or 20 times increase. The research is \u201cvery important work,\u201d said John Emmert, an atmospheric scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, who has studied atmospheric density loss. However, Emmert says more research is needed to understand the severity of the problem \u2014 with the impact of the sun\u2019s solar cycle also known to be a major factor in atmospheric density changes. The findings may also pose challenges for regulators and satellite operators, especially  SpaceX ,  Amazon  and other companies seeking to build megaconstellations of thousands of satellites to beam internet service down to the ground from low Earth orbit. Just last month, for example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a request from SpaceX to decrease the orbits of nearly 3,000 satellites in its Starlink constellation, reasoning that atmospheric drag would naturally sweep up dead satellites and debris in a reasonable amount of time. Research by Brown and his team suggests that assumption may be flawed. An FCC spokesman said that most of its applicants currently used Nasa\u2019s debris assessment software to predict lifetimes of satellites in low Earth orbit. \u201cWe do not know at this time if there are any plans to change that program to address the changes in atmospheric composition predicted in the paper,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FCC periodically reviews its rules and regulations and updates them consistent with developments in the marketplace and in scientific knowledge.\u201d SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Lewis said that he suspected that some of the modelling, however, relies on outdated data, and that more needed to be done to actively remove satellites and debris from orbit rather than relying on the passive atmospheric effect. \u201cOperators have to make this aspect of the mission a priority,\u201d he said. Even a moderate increase in lifetimes for large constellations could pose significant problems. \u201cIf SpaceX\u2019s spacecraft re-enter passively in 10 or 15 years, would you argue that\u2019s good enough?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cGiven the fact that it\u2019s a large constellation, lots of people would say probably not.\u201d \u00a9 The New York Times Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Camilla Toulmin, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason now for the UK not to ratify the agreement as soon as possible.\" The Paris agreement will only come into force after a threshold of 55 signatories producing more than half of emissions has been passed, possibly by the end of this year. It came on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, where issues including the Syrian civil war, the Ukraine conflict and the refugee crisis are on the table for discussion. Tensions remain high between Beijing and Washington, with issues including cyber hacking,  Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea  and the planned deployment of an  American anti-missile system in South Korea  souring relations that had recently been improving. But combating climate change is one area where both countries have stressed they can work together, producing 38 per cent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions.  Both China and the US were key to reaching an agreement with 195 nations in Paris last year, where they set a 2030 deadline for emissions to stop rising and announced their \u201cshared conviction that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing humanity\". The Chinese government announced its intention to ratify the deal in April, following  23 other countries. Li Shuo, senior climate policy adviser for Greenpeace, said the move by the US and China was a \u201ca very important next step toward a truly global climate agreement that will bind the two biggest emitters in the world\u201d.  The agreement's long-term goal is to keep global warming below 2C as compared with pre-industrial times. Temperatures have already risen by almost 1C since the industrial revolution, causing a pattern of climate change scientists blame for catastrophic droughts, extreme weather and melting of polar ice caps.

Although the figures are not legally binding, countries must report on their progress and give an update every five years starting in 2020. The plan has  provoked controversy over possible its impact on trade, agriculture and manufacturing  in developing countries, who are \u201cencouraged\u201d \u2013 rather than required \u2013 to reduce emissions as their capabilities evolve over time.

The research, published in journal  The Lancet Planetary Health  this month, revealed that over the past 11 years, the number of deaths attributed to excessive natural heat is at least 50 times greater than is recorded on  death certificates  in Australia.  During that time some 340 deaths in Australia were recorded as excessive heat but experts from The Australian National University (ANU) found that 36,765 could be attributed to the environmental conditions, following statistical analysis. The study indicates that the heat-related mortality rate in Australia is actually around 2 per cent.  The doctors noted that the intense summer bushfires in the country not only killed some of those directly fighting the blazes but also those who died prematurely from smoke exposure.  Dr Arnagretta Hunter, of ANU Medical School who co-authored the study, said in a statement: \"Climate change is a killer, but we don\u2019t acknowledge it on death certificates.\" She pointed to the inclusion on death certificates of pre-existing conditions and other factors.  \u201cIf you have an asthma attack and die during heavy smoke exposure from bushfires, the death certificate should include that information. We can make a diagnosis of disease like coronavirus, but we are less literate in environmental determinants like hot weather or bushfire smoke.\u201d  The researchers said modernisation of death certification is required to account for the impact of large environmental disasters. Other  countries  are exploring ways of modernising death records and the researchers say that it is imperative in order to get a true picture of the consequences of climate change.  \"Understanding the degree to which environmental factors affect human health is important if the impact of climate change is to be fully appreciated,\" the study noted.

Trees store huge amounts of carbon to function as an essential shield against rising temperatures but, surprisingly, some climate experts have said forests should be removed to make way for  carbon capture technologies . Such methods are considered essential if the planet\u2019s warming is to stay below the most ambitious targets set by international climate agreements. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is widely regarded as the most cost-effective and viable negative emissions technology on offer. Power stations using BECCS could grow crops to use as biomass, that could in turn be burned to generate power with the resulting carbon dioxide stored deep underground. Most future predictions in which warming is limited to 1.5C \u2013 the target set by the Paris climate agreement \u2013 include this technology. But there is a problem. The land required to grow enough crops would be twice the size of India, and most scenarios therefore involve chopping down trees to make way for it. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cIf you want to avoid replacing agriculture crops with bioenergy crops, there is only so much land available \u2013 that\u2019s why in these scenarios there was some deforestation for bioenergy crops, but we found that didn\u2019t pay off in terms of carbon in the end,\u201d Dr Anna Harper from the University of Exeter, who led the new study, told  The Independent . \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad or won\u2019t work, but we probably shouldn\u2019t be cutting down forest to put these crops in.\u201d Instead, Dr Harper and her team found that simply planting more trees and preserving the ones we have would be a more effective way of combating climate change.  \u201cIn some places, BECCS will be effective, but we\u2019ve found that in many places, protecting or regenerating forests is much more sensible,\u201d said co-author Dr Tom Powell. The findings,  published in the journal  Nature Communications , come after scientists raised the alarm about a  potential \u201chothouse Earth\u201d  future, in which destructive feedback loops accelerate global warming out of control.  Though the probability of such a catastrophic outcome is uncertain, the only way to prevent it happening, according to scientists, is to stop the planet getting too much hotter than it already is. Forests were highlighted as a major component in achieving this goal and preserving Earth\u2019s stability. \u201cIf we limit climate change then we are less likely to have these runaway feedback loops that occur,\u201d said Dr Harper.

Techniques intended to reduce emissions while also cutting water use may in fact be boosting some greenhouse gases, meaning the impact of rice cultivation may be up to twice as bad as previous estimates suggest. Scientists at the US-based advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund suggest the short-term warming impact of these additional gases in the atmosphere could be equivalent to 1,200 coal power plants. Considering the importance of rice as a staple food crop, providing more calories to the global population than any other food, the researchers have recommended ways to adapt farming practices and make its cultivation more climate-friendly. Past estimates have suggested that 2.5 per cent of human-induced climate warming can be attributed to rice farming. The main culprit is methane, a potent greenhouse gas emitted from flooded rice fields as bacteria in the waterlogged soil produce it in large quantities. However, there is another gas produced by rice fields that can have a harmful climate effect. Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, is also produced by soil microbes in rice fields. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Partly in a bid to reduce methane emissions, several international organisations have promoted intermittent flooding of rice fields, but this practice comes with problems of its own. \u201cThe full climate impact of rice farming has been significantly underestimated because up to this point, nitrous dioxide emissions from intermittently flooded farms have not been included,\u201d said Dr Kritee Kritee from the Environmental Defense Fund, who led the research. Analysis by the team showed that process of alternately wetting and drying rice fields \u2013 while reducing methane levels \u2013 is producing up to 45 times more nitrous oxide than constantly flooded fields. The intermittent flooding and airing of the fields results in pulses of microbial activity that in turn leads to increased nitrous oxide levels. These results, obtained by working with  farms in southern India , were published in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . \u201cIncreasing pressure on limited water resources under a changing climate could make additional rice farming regions look to intermittent flooding to address water limitations and concerns about methane emissions,\u201d said Dr Kritee. \u201cWater management on rice farms needs to be calibrated to balance water use concerns with the climate impacts of both methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\u201d Despite being a powerful greenhouse gas in its own right that traps even more heat in the atmosphere than methane over long time periods, most rice producing countries do not report their nitrous oxide emissions. Dr Kritee said it was essential that scientists began investigating this overlooked threat so that nations can tackle it effectively. \u201cWe now know nitrous oxide emissions from rice farming can be large and impactful,\u201d said Richie Ahuja, a co-author of this study.  By considering each farm individually and taking into account their methane, nitrous oxide and water use, the scientists suggest that specific strategies can be used that can minimise emissions of climate harming gases. \u201cWe now also know how to manage the problem. Major rice producing nations in Asia are investing to improve the agriculture sector and could benefit from the suggested dual mitigation strategies that lead to water savings, better yields, and less climate pollution,\u201d said Mr Ahuja.

Dozens of the naturally refrigerated food shelters exist underneath the region\u2019s mainly Inupiat  whaling  villages \u2013 where many rely on hunting and fishing to eat. But now  climate change  and other modern factors are forcing changes to an ancient way of life, rendering traditional storage methods dangerously unreliable. Ranging from small arctic root cellars to spacious, wood-lined underground chambers, ice cellars are typically stocked with vast amounts of whale, walrus, seal and caribou. These chambers, usually built 10 to 12 feet below the surface, have long been used to age subsistence food to perfection and ensure a steady supply during the sparser months, which is critical for survival.  Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay But increasingly, these cellars are beginning to collect mould and water, in some cases becoming completely submerged. Others collapse completely. In Alaska\u2019s northernmost community, Utqiagvik \u2013 which saw its warmest summer on record this year \u2013 about 60 per cent of the 1,500 households rely on subsistence foods for at least half of their diet,  National Geographic  wrote in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d said Gordon Brower, a Utqiagvik whaling captain whose family owns two ice cellars.  One is more than a century old and used to store at least two tonnes whale meat set aside for community feasts. The other, built in 1955, is used to feed Mr Brower and his family. He recently asked his son to retrieve some whale meat from the one of the cellars, and discovered both were in a bad state. \u201cHe came back and said: \u2018Dad, there\u2019s a pool of blood and water at the bottom,\u2019\u201d said Mr Brower, who is now housing the community\u2019s meat under a tarpaulin sheet above ground.  \u201cIt seems like slight temporary variations in the  permafrost  \u2013 that active layer \u2013 is affecting the temperature of our cellar,\u201d Mr Brower said. There were once at least 50 ice cellars in Point Hope, a native village built precariously on a thin spit of land caught between the Chukchi and Arctic oceans. Now, there are less than 20 cellars in the village of 750 people. Many in the community have little money and cannot afford to replace traditional methods with modern freezers. To compensate, Point Hope whaling captains have use of three walk-in freezers that were donated for use by the whaling community.  But the much colder freezers do not impart the taste of aged whale meat so favoured throughout the region.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge at this time to be able to feed our people that acquired taste,\u201d said 52-year-old whaling captain Russell Lane, who has spent his whole life in Point Hope.  The problem has been building for decades as a warming climate impacts multiple facets of life in the far-north \u2013 thawing permafrost, disruptions in hunting patterns and shorter periods of coastal ice that had long protected coastal communities from powerful storms. Other factors include development and soil conditions. The changes have increased vulnerability to foodborne illnesses and raised concerns about food security, according to studies by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.  State health officials said so far they have not heard of anyone becoming ill. Despite the unprecedented rate of modern climate change, ice cellars have failed as far back as the early 1900s, according to a 2017 study in Utqiagvik in response to reports of flooded and collapsed cellars. Researchers mapped 71 ice cellar locations around town and monitored five functioning cellars from 2005 to 2015, finding little thermal change over that relatively short timeframe. One of those cellars has since failed, however, and another is starting to collapse. The study concluded that while a changing climate has great potential to affect ice cellars, there are other factors, including soil conditions and urban development. \u201cClimate change, air temperatures, all these physical changes are affecting them,\u201d said Kelsey Nyland from George Washington University, one of the study\u2019s authors.  \u201cBut also, a lot of it has to do with development and modern life in an arctic setting.\u201d Scientists had previously agreed that an underground tunnel, known as the utilidor, built in Utqiagvik in 1984 to provide water, electricity, and other utilities had been responsible for the failure of some cellars,  National Geographic  reported in 2015. To adapt to the new environment, the village of Kaktovik, on the Beaufort Sea coast, took ambitious steps after it lost all but one family\u2019s cellar to flooding. In 2013, the village launched a project to build a community ice cellar incorporating traditional designs with contemporary technology used in Alaska\u2019s North Slope oil fields \u2013 thermosyphons, off-grid tubelike refrigeration devices that cool the ground by transferring heat outside. The hand-excavated cellar was ready for use in 2017, but it has yet to be filled. Whaling captains want to expand it first, according to whaling captain George Kaleak Sr, who represents Kaktovik on the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission. Temperature sensors inside the cellar show it\u2019s working as intended, Kaleak said. He expects the expansion to begin as early as next spring. But experts warn melting ice cellars are a problem for hunters across the Arctic.  While some communities are able to avert crisis using modern technology, in Siberia the disappearance of millennia-old permafrost  is now creating climate refugees . With researchers continually revising their predictions for how quickly permafrost could melt, and how this could contribute to the warming of the planet, it seems increasingly likely those forced to leave their homes will not be the last. \u201cThe permafrost is thawing so fast,\u201d Anna Liljedahl, associate professor at the University of Alaska told  The Washington Post  in October \u201cWe scientists can\u2019t keep up anymore.\u201d Additional reporting by AP Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Global warming is causing spring to arrive early and autumn to come late \u2013 but\u00a0not all species are adapting at the same rate Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Every year, as the seasons change, a complex ballet unfolds around the world. Trees in the northern hemisphere leaf out in the spring as frost recedes. Caterpillars hatch to gorge on leaves. Bees and butterflies emerge to pollinate flowers. Birds leave the southern hemisphere and fly thousands of miles to lay eggs and feast on insects in the north. All of these species stay in sync with each other by relying on environmental cues, much as ballet dancers move to orchestral music. But global warming is changing the music, with spring now arriving several weeks earlier in parts of the world than it did a few decades ago. Not all species are adjusting to this warming at the same rate, and, as a result, some are falling out of step. Scientists who study the changes in plants and animals triggered by seasons have a term for this: phenological mismatch. And they\u2019re still trying to understand exactly how such mismatches \u2013 like the blooming of a flower before its pollinator emerges \u2013 might affect ecosystems. In some cases, species might simply adapt by shifting their ranges or eating different foods. But if species can\u2019t adapt quickly enough, these mismatches could have \u201csignificant negative impacts,\u201d said Madeleine Rubenstein, a biologist at the US Geological Survey\u2019s National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Centre. \u201cIf you look at the past history of climate on earth, there has never been such a dramatic, rapid change in the climate,\u201d said Andrea Santangeli, a postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Museum of Natural History. \u201cSpecies have to respond really fast. That\u2019s really unprecedented.\u201d Here are five examples of mismatch, just one of the many threats that species face from global warming, that scientists have discovered so far: An orchid\u2019s sex life turns bleak The early spider orchid relies on deception to reproduce. Each spring the orchid, whose bulbous crimson body looks like an insect, releases a pheromone that tricks solitary male bees into thinking the plant is a mating partner \u2013 a key step for pollination. This ruse, which scientists call pseudocopulation, works because the orchid tends to bloom during a specific window each spring \u2013 shortly after lonely male bees emerge from hibernation but before female bees appear. Yet with spring coming earlier, female bees are now emerging sooner and luring the male bees away from the lovelorn orchid, according to a 2014 study from Britain. By examining data collected in herbariums and in the field over a century, the researchers found that the gap between the times when male bees and female bees emerge shrinks by about 6.6 days for each degree celsius of warming, giving the orchid less opportunity to reproduce. \u201cThe main finding is that things are getting increasingly bad for orchid pollination,\u201d said Anthony Davy, a professor of biological science at the University of East Anglia, and the lead author of the paper. For this orchid \u2013 which is already rare \u2013 the future looks bleak, he said. Spring comes early, but the flycatcher doesn\u2019t The European pied flycatcher runs on a tight schedule each spring. From its wintering grounds in Africa, the bird flies thousands of miles north to Europe to lay eggs in time for the emergence of winter moth caterpillars, which appear for a few weeks each spring to munch on young oak leaves. By timing this just right, the flycatchers ensure there\u2019s enough food around when their hungry chicks hatch. In a series of studies in the 2000s, however, scientists in the Netherlands showed that many flycatchers were starting to miss this narrow window. Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray As spring temperatures warmed, oak trees were leafing out earlier and peak caterpillar season was arriving up to two weeks sooner in some places. But many flycatchers, which appear to schedule their departure from Africa based on the length of day there, were not getting to Europe early enough for their spring meals. In the parts of the Netherlands where peak caterpillar season had advanced the fastest, the scientists later found, flycatcher populations dwindled sharply. \u201cThat was the big discovery that suggested this mismatch could have real consequences for populations,\u201d said Christiaan Both, an ecologist at the University of Groningen. Birds and tractors get too close for comfort Climate change doesn\u2019t just cause missed connections. In some cases, the advance of warmer weather can lead to perilous meetings. In Finland, for example, the Northern lapwing and Eurasian curlew have usually built their ground nests on barley fields after farmers have sown their crops in the spring. But as temperatures have risen, the birds are now increasingly laying their eggs before the farmers get to the fields, which means their well-concealed nests are more likely to get destroyed by tractors and other machinery. Looking at 38 years of data, researchers found that farmers in Finland are now sowing their fields a week earlier in response to warmer temperatures, but the birds are laying their eggs two to three weeks earlier. \u201cThis has created a phenological mismatch,\u201d said Santangeli. \u201cThe response we\u2019ll see is declines of these birds.\u201d Caribou show up late for lunch Caribou in western Greenland follow a strict seasonal diet. In the winter, they eat lichen along the coast. In the spring and summer, they venture inland to give birth to their calves and eat the Arctic plants that grow there. As Greenland has warmed up and sea ice has declined, however, those inland Arctic plants have been emerging earlier \u2013 with some plant species now greening 26 days earlier than they did a decade ago.  But the caribou have not shifted their migration as quickly. And scientists have documented a troubling trend in the region: More caribou calves appear to be dying early in years when the spring plant growth preceded the caribou\u2019s calving season. While that study only found a correlation between warmer temperatures and caribou calf deaths, \u201cit\u2019s consistent with the idea that mismatch is disadvantageous,\u201d said Eric Post, an ecology professor at the University of California, Davis. When Arctic plants green up earlier, they may become tougher and less nutritious by the time the caribou get there and start eating them. Why don\u2019t the caribou speed up their migration? One possibility is that their reproductive cycles respond most strongly to seasonal signals like the length of the day, whereas plants respond more strongly to local temperatures, which are rising. In theory, if given enough time, the caribou might eventually adjust as natural selection takes its course and favours individuals that calve earlier. But with the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the globe, Post said, \u201cthe question is whether things are changing too fast for evolution to matter\u201d. The snowshoe hare has a wardrobe malfunction Climate change doesn\u2019t just cause mismatches in the spring. Consider the snowshoe hare, whose fur coat has evolved to change from brown to white during the winter for camouflage. As the Earth has warmed, however, snow cover in the hare\u2019s habitat melts sooner, leaving the animal more exposed to predators. \u201cCamouflage is critical to keep prey animals alive,\u201d said L. Scott Mills, a professor of wildlife biology at the University of Montana who studies the impacts of camouflage mismatch on species like the snowshoe hare. For every week the hare is mismatched, Mills and his colleagues found, it had a 7 per cent higher chance of being killed by predators like the lynx. Currently, the hare is only mismatched by a week or two. But by mid-century, Mills said, that could extend up to eight weeks. If that were to happen, he said, the hare \u201cwould start declining toward extinction\u201d. There is some good news for the snowshoe hare, however. Where evolution was previously thought to take millions of years, scientists now think an animal like the hare could adapt in five to 10 generations, especially if those parts of the hare population that are more adaptable are protected. \u201cIt does give us an avenue for hope,\u201d Mills said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that species with phenological mismatch are going to go extinct.\u201d \u00a9  New York Times Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A new study by academics at University College London (UCL) found that higher amounts of  greenhouse gas  in the atmosphere could affect our memory, concentration and decision-making abilities. Raised CO2 in workplaces lacking proper ventilation is known to make employees more sluggish and less able to successfully complete tasks.

The UCL team said evidence indicated that \u201chuman cognitive performance declines with increasing CO2 levels\u201d.

Jean-Baptiste Gouyon   discusses Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile T he BBC\u2019s new wildlife television series featuring  David Attenborough ,  Seven Worlds, One Planet , marks a drastic departure from previous programmes. For the first time, the presenter can be heard repeatedly uttering the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d in a BBC documentary series otherwise devoted to exploring and explaining animal behaviour and how they adapt to their environment. The series marks a turn in the history of wildlife television broadcasting. In the UK, it is being celebrated as the long-awaited engagement of one of the most trusted public figures with the most pressing issue of our time. But why has it taken so long, and how will it shape the genre going forward? Critics might want to claim that the move is simply a case of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d \u2013 the BBC jumping on the bandwagon of the climate emergency so that its wildlife programming remains relevant. But the BBC has already produced  specific programmes on climate change , also featuring David Attenborough, over the past two decades. It just hasn\u2019t integrated climate change into wildlife TV until now. Critics might want to claim that the move is simply a case of \u2018greenwashing\u2019, but the BBC has already produced\u00a0specific programmes on climate change, also featuring David\u00a0Attenborough, over the past two decades. It just hasn\u2019t integrated climate change into wildlife TV until now As I show in my new book,  BBC Wildlife Documentaries in the Age of Attenborough , wildlife television\u2019s main environmental focus has traditionally been the conservation of biodiversity. When  Desmond Hawkins  created the BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) in 1957, one of his objectives was to instil a sense of the value of protecting nature in audiences. One line of argument in favour of this project was philosophical and aesthetic. This framed nature as indispensable to humans as a source of solace and regeneration in the aftermath of the Second World War. Another argument was moral and framed wildlife as heirloom. Humans had a duty of care towards other forms of life on the planet, so that future generations could enjoy them. As part of this approach, viewers were encouraged to develop an emotional attachment to wildlife, making them more inclined to support conservation. In one of the most celebrated wildlife TV sequences of all times, from  Life on Earth  (BBC, 1979) , Attenborough appears to cuddle with mountain gorillas in Rwanda. Emphasising how much common ground exists between humans and big apes,  it is credited  with having been instrumental in kick-starting fundraising for the protection of mountain gorillas. The now famous and disturbing sequence of walruses falling off a cliff in north-east Russia in the second episode of the series has come to epitomise this new \u2018show it like it is\u2019 approach But when it came to the environment, British wildlife TV took an allusive approach rather than a head-on one. That\u2019s because producers thought that programmes with an unambiguous focus on environmental issues could only be structured around \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d stories \u2013 scaring away the large audiences that wanted to experience the wonders of wildlife. A daring way forward This kind of tactic could only go so far, though. Forty years on, and the makers of  Our Planet  (Netflix, 2019)  finally did away with it. They provided viewers with uncompromising depictions of the consequences of climate change on wildlife. The now famous and disturbing sequence of walruses falling off a cliff in north-east Russia in the second episode of the series, has come to epitomise this new \u201cshow it like it is\u201d approach. In response, the BBC likewise chose to be uncompromising in its portrayal of climate change\u2019s impact on animals\u2019 existence. The dramatic sequence of a grey-headed albatross chick blown off its nest during a storm induced by climate change in  Seven Worlds, One Planet  is similarly hard to forget. Yet, none of these two series can be said to have gone down the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d pathway seen in many previous documentaries about climate change. On the contrary, the overall message is rather positive, one of hope. How come? Throughout  the history of wildlife television , filmmakers have been adept at talking to scientists, enabling them to use cutting-edge research to renew the stories they tell. Wildlife, after all, does not change very much. And research highlights the value of wildlife conservation as one of the solutions to the climate crisis. For example, a recent study demonstrated that tropical forests with a thriving population of elephants  absorb significantly higher volumes of carbon dioxide  than tropical forests without such animals. Building on such research showing that environmental issues are connected, it becomes possible to make a positive case for wildlife conservation \u2013 beyond the moral or aesthetic arguments that prevailed in the past. A recent study demonstrated that tropical forests with a thriving population of elephants\u00a0absorb significantly higher volumes of carbon dioxide\u00a0than tropical forests without such animals. That climate change  regularly polls  in the top three issues of concern in global populations, as extreme weather events  follow one another , has obviously helped drive this change. The ability to offer hope in the shape of solutions to global warming therefore presents wildlife filmmakers with new storytelling opportunities that can draw large audiences. For the first time in the  history of wildlife filmmaking , the conservation of wildlife can be presented as holding the promise of a happy ending, in ways that are relevant to a large segment of the world population.  Our Planet and Seven Worlds, One Planet  therefore mark the start of a new era for wildlife television \u2013 one which  doesn\u2019t shy away from  political and environmental problems. And the trend looks set to continue. Each episode of  Seven Worlds, One Planet  consistently drew around 8 million viewers in the UK, whereas  Our Planet  boasted 33 million worldwide. In the coming years, wildlife broadcasters are likely to keep using this new story line, foregrounding the climate crisis as evidence that wildlife conservation is more necessary than ever. Ultimately, wildlife television\u2019s long-awaited engagement with climate change is not greenwashing. Instead, it is the outcome of new research enabling producers to integrate the defining issue of our time in their main narrative framework \u2013 and offering hope.

In the messages, sent between 2010 and 2012,  Anne-Marie Trevelyan  approvingly quoted the work of groups which have rejected the mainstream scientific consensus that human activity is driving  climate change . And she stated that one such group had provided \u201cclear evidence that the ice caps aren\u2019t melting after all, to counter those gloom-mongers and global warming fanatics\u201d. Labour condemned the Berwick MP\u2019s elevation to the cabinet just weeks ahead of the COP26 UN conference being chaired by Boris Johnson in Glasgow, at which the prime minister is hoping to persuade countries from around the world to sign up to ambitious carbon-cutting targets. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to the International trade brief on Wednesday from a more junior role in the business department where she had responsibility for clean growth. Her controversial comments on climate change date back to before she entered parliament in 2015, but after she had fought the previous general election as a Tory candidate In one tweet, backing a campaign against wind farms in 2012, she said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t getting hotter, global warming isn\u2019t actually happening.\u201d And in another message she praised as \u201cintelligent\u201d an article about the \u201cglobal warming myth\u201d by the Climate Realists group, who argue that temperature rises cannot be blamed on manmade carbon emissions. In 2011, she gave her support to outspoken climate emergency denier Lord Lawson for \u201chitting back\u201d at then energy secretary Chris Huhne\u2019s \u201cideological obsession with manmade climate change\u201d. Shadow international development secretary  Emily Thornberry  highlighted the string of messages, with the comment: \u201cAt least the last Trade Secretary only hired climate change deniers\u2026\u201d She was referring to Ms Trevelyan\u2019s predecessor  Liz Truss , who hired former Australian PM and climate sceptic Tony Abbott as a UK trade envoy. Ms Trevelyan later insisted she was \u201cproud\u201d of the government\u2019s action on climate change and will make it \u201ca priority\u201d in her new job. \u201cThis government is united in achieving our ambitious climate target goals,\u201d said the international trade secretary. \u201cHaving worked directly on COP26, I am proud of what we have already done to tackle climate change and embrace a greener and cleaner future, including being the first major economy to legislate for a Net Zero target by 2050 and launching a bold plan for the UK\u2019s world-leading hydrogen economy. \u201cAs International Trade Secretary, climate change and protecting the environment will remain a priority as I negotiate ambitious trade deals around the world.\u201d Mr Johnson\u2019s reshuffle continued into a second day on Thursday, with the prime minister finalising non-cabinet jobs and promoting a raft of female Conservative rising stars ahead of the first meeting of the new cabinet at 10 Downing Street on Friday. Former biomedical scientist Maggie Throup was made vaccines minister, following Nadhim Zahawi\u2019s appointment yesterday as education secretary. Lucy Frazer and  Helen Whately  moved to the Treasury as financial secretary and exchequer secretary, while barrister  Victoria Atkins  was promoted to minister of state at the Ministry of Justice. Gillian Keegan was promoted to minister of state rank at the Department of Health, while Chloe Smith moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Work and Pensions. Other appointments included Alex Chalk as Solicitor General and Conor Burns minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office. Robin Walker was moved from Northern Ireland to education. Justin Tomlinson left the Department for Work and Pensions to become Tory Party deputy chair. After sacking three cabinet ministers on Wednesday, Mr Boris also ejected a raft of long-serving ministers of lower rank. Downing Street confirmed that Nick Gibb was leaving the Department for Education after 10 years as a schools minister. In a clear indication he had been sacked, the former minister said he was \u201csad\u201d not to keep the post. Also ousted were former culture secretary John Whittingdale, who had been a fierce critic of the BBC licence fee as media minister, and  Jesse Norman , who leaves the Treasury after five years in government.  Fears that Mr Johnson\u2019s new culture secretary  Nadine Dorries  intends to declare war on the BBC were stoked by a cabinet colleague, who said she would take on \u201ccrackpot\u201d programmes funded by the licence fee-payer. Defence secretary Ben Wallace suggested that Ms Dorries - a best-selling author of romantic fiction - was more in tune with the tastes of the British public than BBC executives. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about Nadine Dorries is that she produces culture that people buy and actually want to see, rather than some of the more crackpot schemes we\u2019ve seen being funded in the past by taxpayers money,\u201d Mr Wallace told Sky News. \u201cI think she\u2019ll bring realism to it.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Managing to do this, he said, would be \u201cthe most amazing thing humanity has ever done\u201d. Mr Gates told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve never made a transition like we\u2019re talking about doing in the next 30 years. There is no precedent for this.\u201d The  Microsoft  founder\u2018s new book,  How to Avoid a Climate Disaster , which will be released on Tuesday, offers a guide on how to tackle global warming with a particular focus on the ways technology can be used to do this.\u00a0 The billionaire has argued that governments need to do more to help deter people from using fossil fuels.  He also suggested countries should be more transparent and use an economic system that prices in the real cost of using fossil fuels and the damage they are doing to the environment. Currently, the world adds around 50 billion tonnes of  greenhouse gases  to the atmosphere every year, which governments including the UK have pledged to cut to net zero in the coming decades.  This means that any carbon emissions would be balanced by absorbing the same amount from the atmosphere. Many governments focus on using more renewable sources of energy. However Mr Gates said these only account for 30 per cent of total carbon emissions and the business magnate raised concerns about how to decarbonise the other 70 per cent.  This other 70 per cent includes emissions created by transport systems and the production of steel, cement and fertiliser. A way to solve this would be innovation on a scale the world has never before seen, Mr Gates said.  He added that he remained optimistic that the world still had time to avoid the worst effects of climate change: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve seen many times, innovation surprises us in a positive way.\u201d Despite his interest in helping to save the planet from climate change, Mr Gates admitted to arriving at the 2015 Paris climate summit in a private plane.  \u201cI am aware that I\u2019m an imperfect messenger on climate change,\u201d he said, according to an extract of his book. \u201cThe world is not exactly lacking in rich men with big ideas about what other people should do, or who think technology can fix any problem.  \u201cI own big houses and fly in private planes \u2013 in fact, I took one to Paris for the climate conference, so who am I to lecture anyone on the environment?\u201d But the billionaire said he wanted his ideas to play a part in the green stimulus packages being proposed around the world, inlcuding those which will be discussed as the UK prepares to host a climate conference in Glasgow in November this year.

The letter was sent after Richard Lindzen, an emeritus professor at the renowned institute, urged the President to withdraw the United States from international efforts to limit global warming, claiming such actions were not justified by the science. Professor Lindzen is one of only a handful of actual climate scientists who disagree with the overwhelming consensus among experts on the issue \u2014 that climate change is real and will increasingly lead to devastating storms, deadly heatwaves, drought and other problems around the world unless action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Signed by various associate, assistant, emeritus and full professors,  the MIT climate scientists' letter said : \u201cIt has come to our attention that our colleague Richard Lindzen, professor emeritus at MIT, has sent a letter urging you to withdraw from the UN climate convention, claiming that actions with respect to global climate are not scientifically justified. \u201cAs his colleagues at MIT in the program in atmospheres, oceans and climate, all of whom are actively involved in understanding climate, we write to make it clear that this is not a view shared by us, or by the overwhelming majority of other scientists who have devoted their professional lives to careful study of climate science. \u201cThe risks to the Earth system associated with increasing levels of carbon dioxide are almost universally agreed by climate scientists to be real ones. \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and increases in extreme flooding and droughts, all with serious consequences for mankind.\u201d It said that various scientific bodies, such as the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union, had backed the scientific consensus. \u201cWe owe it to future generations to remain engaged with the international community to seek the widest possible efforts to understand and mitigate those threats,\u201d the letter added. Professor Lindzen is recognised as a climate scientist by others in the field even though they profoundly disagree with him.  However one leading climatologist, who has worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s reports, described him as someone who enjoyed taking a \u201ccontrarian\u201d position. In his letter to Mr Trump last month, Professor Lindzen wrote: \u201cThe US and other governments have undertaken actions with respect to global climate that \u2026 already have, and will continue to cause serious social and economic harm \u2013 with no environmental benefits.  \u201cRestricting access to fossil fuels has very negative effects upon the well-being of people around the world. It condemns over four billion people in still under-developed countries to continued poverty. \u201cThere is clear evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is environmentally helpful to food crops and other plants that nourish all life. It is plant food, not poison.\u201d Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan His views on poverty in the developing world appear somewhat out of date. Renewable technologies like solar have recently become significantly cheaper than fossil fuels as a source of electricity in many developing countries, resulting in a boom based largely on pure economics. The \u2018greening\u2019 effect, in which plant growth is boosted by extra carbon, is real and is often cited as a benefit of global warming by sceptics, who ignore or dismiss the predicted negative effects. However plants will not absorb enough carbon to prevent the rise in temperature and the associated extreme weather conditions. The Global Warming Policy Foundation, the UK-based sceptic think tank, adopts a \u2018lukewarmist\u2019 position. This  accepts all climate science  up to the present date, but claims the  predicted temperature rises in the future are exaggerated . The forecasts are based on computer models that have been  shown to be remarkably accurate .

The fish-and-chip shop staple may be replaced on plates by warm-adapted species which are growing in abundance in the UK\u2019s heating seas, researchers said. Red mullet, Dover sole, John Dory and lemon sole, which all thrive in warmer waters, are already turning up more often in catches. Scientists who projected changes to fish stocks over the coming decades said diners may need to adapt their diet to help cold-adapted species such as cod, monkfish and megrim survive. The Celtic Sea, English Channel and southern North Sea have undergone significant warming over the past 45 years and further rises in sea temperatures are expected as  climate change  continues. Researchers from the University of Exeter, the University of Bristol, the Centre for Environment,  Fisheries  and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) and the Met Office used computer models to predict changes in fish numbers by 2090. Lead author Dr Katherine Maltby, a marine climate change scientist at Cefas, said: \u201cOur results show that climate change will continue to affect fish stocks within this sea region into the future, presenting both potential risks but some opportunities that fishers will likely have to adapt to. \u201cConsumers can help fishers take advantage of these  fishing  opportunities by seeking out other fish species to eat and enjoy.\u201d Researchers at Plymouth Marine Laboratory have previously warned the numbers of large fish in the North Sea may fall by as much as 60 per cent as waters warm. The North Sea is heating more than twice as fast as the world\u2019s oceans, which hit record high temperatures last year. The average temperature of North Sea waters rose by 1.67C over the past 45 years. According to  Met Office estimates , the North Sea, the English Channel, and the Irish and Celtic Seas will rise a further 3C by the end of the century. The new study, published in the  Journal of Applied Ecology , notes that more flexible management of the fishing industry will be needed to reduce the impact of global warming on species. Co-author Louise Rutterford, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Exeter, said: \u201cWe know from working with fishers that warmer water species are appearing in catches more. Bringing together their \u2018on-the-ground\u2019 experiences with studies like ours will help inform future management decisions that enable sustainable exploitation while supporting fishers\u2019 adaptation.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

But\u00a0what about the natural weapon at our disposal in the fight against global warming: reforestation? Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile As the old green mantra goes, \"think globally, act locally.\" That helps to explain why, on a gusty and showery November day, I'm not for the moment pondering the fate of Borneo or Brazil but gazing out over the young woodlands that spread over the site of a decommissioned surface coal mine in Leicestershire. Cycle routes now criss-cross this refurbished ground and, even today, visitors fill the Hicks Lodge caf\u00e9. Photographs from the 1990s still depict a hellish late-industrial wasteland, the face of the earth scraped and flattened into swathes of ugly black scar-tissue. These days, as Sam Lattaway \u2013 head of landscape and biodiversity for the National Forest \u2013 has just told me, Hicks Lodge is \"probably the best place in the area for bird-watching. If you're up there in the summer, you will hear skylarks, you will see lapwings. Twenty years ago, when I worked in mining, that was an operating open-cast mine.\" Our home-grown National Forest, which is gradually greening more than 200 square miles of Staffordshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire, ranks as a tender sapling in a vast, dark wood. As the great climate-change circus rolls into Paris for the \"COP21\" conference of the United Nations, the vital role of the world's woods as both casualties of environmental ruin and potential saviours of the planet has begun to creep into the sunlight of public debate. Year by year, the loss of forests contributes an estimated 17 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions: more than every mode of transport. Conversely, the ability of trees to store carbon dioxide in natural sinks \u2013 \"carbon sequestration\" \u2013 means that tropical forests alone may remove about a fifth of the chief cause of global warming. Some of the science remains contested, while profit-driven schemes to \"offset\" greenhouse emissions by planting distant trees arouse the ire of green campaigns. Even the measurement of deforestation triggers commotion in activist copses. In September, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) issued its latest \"Global Forest Resources Assessment\". The study calculated that, since 1990, the planet's total forest coverage has declined from 4.13 billion hectares to around 4 billion. Yet those 129 million lost hectares, \"a total area about the size of South Africa\", hide the good news. The rate of loss has slowed by over 50 per cent. FAO director-general Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva reports a positive \"direction of change\", with \"many impressive examples of progress in all regions of the world\". Getty PA Getty Ye et al\/Current Biology Reuters A. Gennari Steven G Johnson  Clay Bolt New Mexico Museum of Natural History Faye Levine, University of Maryland Getty Getty Getty\/AFP Reuters\/AP Viktor Radermacher \/ SWNS ESO\/A. M\u00fcller et al Getty Jos\u00e9 Iriarte Getty Pictures by: Tom Momary Green shoots of recovery, perhaps? Cue a storm of dissent about data-gathering methods, with heated exchanges over (say) the value of reports by individual states against remote assessment by satellite. Do the optimists or the pessimists fail to see the wood for the trees? At any rate, the FAO records that, still, \"the world's forests store an estimated 296 gigatonnes of carbon\", but that degradation has cut capacity by 17.4 gigatonnes since 1990. Whatever the figures, the carbon-storage treasure secreted in our woodlands is now beyond serious dispute. Dr David Coomes, reader in forest ecology and conservation at Cambridge University, confirms that \"there is no question that forests serve globally as major sinks of carbon\". Despite kneejerk doom-and-gloom, he points to successful programmes to limit deforestation and repair degradation in Brazil. \"For the past seven or eight years, it's definitely been a source of inspiration and a good example of why we should not despair. They have protected large areas of the Amazon and committed resources to the restoration of the Atlantic forest.\" Although no panacea, forest renewal still looks like one of the sharpest weapons in the scanty armoury of large-scale measures to mitigate climate change. To Dr Coomes, \"the silver bullet is still flying. We ought to continue to be optimistic about this.\" We need every bullet we can find. This summer, more than 120,000 forest fires on carbon-rich peatlands in Indonesia pushed the country's daily CO2 emissions above those of the US. They struck at least 560,000 people with respiratory ailments, killed a minimum of 22, blanketed South-east Asia in the worst toxic haze since 1997 \u2013 and, most likely, made a future fortune for the oil-palm barons behind many of the criminally-set blazes. Greenhouse-gas statistics aside, the eyes and lungs of scores of millions have just experienced the scourge of deforestation. Compared with the inferno of Sumatra, or the wilderness of parts of Amazonia, an afforestation project like Britain's National Forest may look about as fragile as a twig in a typhoon. Its new woodlands, which began to rise in the early 1990s, knit together former pit villages, market towns, clay-and-gravel works and farmland into a patchwork of varied landscapes. The area has seen 8.5 million trees planted and its \"forest cover\" \u2013 not always uninterrupted woods \u2013 rise from 6 to 20 per cent. These 7,000 hectares of fresh woods will cancel out 2.7m tonnes of CO2 emissions over 50 years. Last year, the forest welcomed almost eight million visitors: to lakes, commons and leisure facilities, as well as into the woods. In English usage, the forest has always meant more than the trees. For Lattaway, \"I think of 'forest' more in the medieval sense, rather than wall-to-wall trees.\" To John Everitt, chief executive of the National Forest Company (an agency sponsored by the Department of Environment), \"the principles we want to promote are building on those traditions of having a mixed, mosaic landscape. We're not trying to create intensive forestry here.\" Literally, as well as figuratively, great oaks sprout from tiny acorns. The seedlings of the 1990s now reach above adult heads. Everitt notes that \"at the outset, you've got trees that are a foot tall in the ground. Taking people to that and saying, 'This is a forest', is quite a leap of faith.\" Now, \"the next generation are planting young trees in an emerging forest. We've carried a generation with us.\" Meanwhile, buzzards fly in the sky and otters swim in the rivers. Lattaway has a wishlist of further reintroductions: woodpeckers, owls, but sadly not red squirrels. This low-conifer landscape simply would not suit them. \"Admittedly, they tend to be quite charismatic species that people are going to get excited about. You're not going to find many slugs on that list.\" Everyone \u2013 in the developed world at least \u2013 loves trees and wants to see more. As an aesthetic choice or a social duty, reforestation predates the discoveries of climate science by centuries. In his classic ramble through the forests of the world, Wildwood, the nature writer Roger Deakin quotes WH Auden: \"A culture is no better than its woods.\" Governments began to grasp the value not only of keeping but reviving them long before the news of global warming hit. In England, which contrary to Robin Hood myth has largely lacked dense woodland for most of its recorded history, protection dates back at least to the \"Charter of the Forest\" in 1217. That mandated penalties for \"waste and assart\": unauthorised felling and enclosure. In modern times, the much-maligned Forestry Commission began its march in the 1920s. It covered tracts of treeless terrain with the drab coniferous carpet that earned it such a bad name. In contrast, traditional broadleaf species \u2013 such as oak, ash and birch \u2013 account for 87 per cent of plantings of the National Forest. As Lattaway makes clear, no one wants monocultural plantations. \"You can plant trees willy-nilly. The challenge is creating new woodlands that contribute to wildlife, to public access, to health and welfare.\" In Britain as a whole, forest cover has reached 12 per cent: low by world standards, but a steep increase on a century ago. Some other countries have gone much further, much faster. On a visit to Korea, I was astonished, and delighted, by the picturesque wooded hills that \u2013 against every expectations of a concrete Asian metropolis \u2013 not only surround Seoul but stretch down almost into the gardens of the city-centre royal palaces. They did not just survive by chance. More than anywhere else on Earth, South Korea re-grew its lost forests as a state priority after the ravages of the Korean War and breakneck modernisation. Under the National Reforestation Programme begun by President Park in 1962, cover rose from 35 per cent in the mid-1950s to 64 per cent today. It took paternalistic, even authoritarian, oversight, under the slogan: \"Cutting trees is evil; planting trees is patriotic.\" But it worked. Above all, Korea regained its forests because the country got rich. A recent report by the Korean Forest Service on the lessons learned from its half-century of re-greening charts the reduction of losses through wood-fuel harvesting, illegal logging or slash-and-burn agriculture. It concludes that \"the underlying cause of all of these drivers was poverty\". Hence the thorny paradox of many reforestation schemes. More affluent people no longer need to chop or burn down woodlands. Yet, as in Korea, the pursuit of affluence may have helped to raze those forests in the first place. Korea has had six post-conflict decades to study the problem and systematically address it. Elsewhere, time is running out. As the clock ticks towards a level of global warming beyond the UN threshold of two degrees, advocates of climate-change mitigation have sought a quicker fix. Set up in 2005, under the UN's Kyoto Protocol, the so-called REDD+ mechanism allows for the creation of a \"compliance carbon\" market. Those assets stored in CO2-neutralising trees have become a tradeable resource. CO2-belching corporations can purge their emission sins in freshly seeded woods. REDD+ remains intensely controversial. Radical ecologists deplore the marketisation of a natural process, and the potential injustice of trapping poor people in a cash-forest that they merely curate for a pittance. Serious money has certainly fallen in love with tall trees. The London-based Permian Global, for instance, finances forest recovery projects in Latin America and Asia run according to \"the highest social and environmental principles\", and sells the \"high-quality verified carbon credits\" they generate. It is headed by Stephen Rumsey: a life-long conservationist, and formerly a pension-fund manager and head of debt markets for Barclays. State actors also play their part. A billion-dollar deal with the Norwegian government helped Brazil to slash its forest loss. \"Economically, it's not going to work against oil-palm\" in still-smoking Indonesia, says Dr Coomes about the REDD model of transactions. However, \"it could be effective against cattle-ranching\" in Amazonia. \"It's not a be-all-and-end-all, but that's no reason to discount it altogether. It's a financial mechanism to protect the forests, and there aren't many of those.\" Back at the National Forest HQ in the former pit village of Moira, John Everitt has begun to pilot a carbon-finance project on a more neighbourly scale. \"We want to move away from the idea of 'trading',\" he explains. \"If you plant trees, in 50 years' time they will have sequestered an amount of carbon. That carbon has value, and that value can be charged out to people who want to pay for it.\" Companies will \"have to make a commitment to keeping the trees for a 50-year period\". Lattaway admits: \"Offsetting makes me nervous. It shouldn't be greenwash. You minimise and you mitigate wherever you can. And whatever's left over that you can't avoid, you offset that.\" Above all, Everitt wants local businesses \u2013 many attracted by the amenities of the forest \u2013 to balance out their CO2 emissions by investing, quite specifically, in their own woody backyard. On both its ethical and economic branches, the carbon-offset business has a lot of growing still to do. Clearer, and less contentious, are the social benefits that woodlands bring. Around the National Forest, schoolchildren plant trees; families dedicate them to loved ones; farmers and landowners raise woods to diversify their income. Forest industries support 300 jobs; leisure and tourism over 4,000 more. Everitt cites the grounds of a stately home that, newly forested, can now host livery stables, festivals, weddings, shoots. A 75-mile walkers' route snakes across this mix-and-match landscape: not a spectacular showcase, but a patchwork re-greening that runs with the grain of the past. Lattaway insists that \"we're not removing the evidence of what was there before\". The \"Black to Green\" project celebrates local mining history: \"We don't want to wipe that out of existence.\" Spoil heaps, as yet unclothed in trees, still dot the country around Moira and Donisthorpe. No one wants to re-name nearby Coalville. Everitt contrasts his mission with the conservation paradigm of, say, an officially designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. \"We're creating heritage, whereas a lot of those other places have heritage that they're protecting. I think it's a really interesting distinction.\" To Lattaway, \"it's a plus-point for us, a selling point. Every time you come, it will have changed.\" Even magnified a thousand-fold, across the tropical carbon sinks of Kalimantan, Madagascar or Minas Gerais, in Brazil, initiatives such as the National Forest can hardly hold back the emissions tide. That will take the sort of binding global deal that Paris aims to deliver. As Dr Coomes reminds me, \"The bottom line is that any seemingly intractable problem cannot be solved overnight.\" Still, new woods, wherever they grow, bring new hope \u2013 locally or globally. Like the living things they are, they also change. Healthy forests mature, mutate, even die. \"The woods decay,\" as Tennyson wrote in Tithonus. \"The woods decay and fall.\" They may also rise again, as in this modestly mingled coal, clay and farming country of the Midlands. \"At the risk of throwing off silly sound bites,\" says Lattaway, \"this is just the next stage of evolution.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile  Gov.  Gavin Newsom  signed an executive order Wednesday to protect nearly a third of California\u2019s  land  and coastal waters in his latest effort to fight  climate change  that he has blamed for recent record-breaking wildfires.  He directed state agencies to pursue actions that will use the state's lands and waters to absorb climate-warming carbon from the atmosphere. Newsom, who made the announcement in a walnut orchard 25 miles outside of Sacramento, said innovative farming practices, restoring wetlands, better forest management, planting more trees and increasing the number of parks are all potential tools.  The goal is part of a larger global effort to protect 30% of the Earth. California is the first state to join 38 countries that have made similar commitments, Newsom said. \u201cThirty by 2030 is the mandate,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cCalifornia, as the fifth-largest economy in the world, needs to flex its muscles, needs to assert itself, and to advance that cause, not only as it relates to its global impacts but hopefully jump-start similar efforts in other states across this country.\u201d This is the second major climate change directive from the  governor  since a string of massive wildfires broke out in mid-August. Fires have burned a record amount of land this year, mostly across  Northern California  killed 31 people, destroyed nearly 9,000 homes, businesses and other structures, and produced massive amounts of air pollution. Last month, Newsom directed state regulators to come up with rules to ban sales of new gas-powered passenger cars and trucks by 2035. He said that plan will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35%.  The automobile announcement was criticized by the White House. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's chief questioned the legality of the move.  Newsom said this latest effort would build on the state's legacy of protecting open space, the environment and biodiversity.  While more than half of California land is owned by the state or federal government, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that only 22% of lands is currently considered protected.  The state thinks it could reach the 30% goal through further conservation efforts on public lands, according to the California Natural Resources Agency. But it wants to get private landowners and the federal government to improve conservation to optimize the role trees, soils and wetlands play in absorbing carbon, said Wade Crowfoot, secretary of natural resources.  \u201cWhen someone thinks about taking action on climate change they think about putting solar on the rooftop or turning off the lights or buying an electric vehicle,\u201d Crowfoot said. \u201dToday the governor elevated nature-based solutions to both combat climate change and build our resilience to these climate impacts.\"  The state said it doesn\u2019t anticipate acquiring costly new lands or requiring significant funding. Practices that could be put in place include easements to conserve land, better soil practices in farming that helps absorb carbon and retain water and clearing out undergrowth to make forests healthier and more efficient at soaking up greenhouse gases. On the state's lengthy coastline, it could also expand its marine-protected waters and restore wetlands.  The news was welcomed by several environmental groups, including some that cheered its impact on threatened species. \u201cGovernor Newsom\u2019s commitment is a watershed moment in the national movement to act on climate, confront the biodiversity crisis, and restore our lands and waters,\u201d Collin O\u2019Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement.  The California Farm Bureau Federation said it is skeptical of the increased use of executive orders. But it is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d growers, ranchers and loggers would have a say in how the order is put into action.  \u201cActions stemming from this executive order should not intensify the existing regulatory environment that favors large businesses over small, and should not favor preservation over the use of renewable resources for public benefit,\" Farm Bureau President Jamie Johansson said in a statement.  Newsom said the effort would not seek to curtail commercial uses on federal lands, such as logging, grazing or mining. He said it was aimed conservation, not \u201ctaking something away.\u201d  Food & Water Action California said the announcement failed to address the fossil fuel industry and thousands of gas and oil drilling permits issued by the state that contributes to climate change.  \u201cUntil Newsom acknowledges the urgent need to halt new oil and gas drilling instead of encouraging it, he can never be taken seriously as a climate leader,\u201d state director Alexandra Nagy said in a statement. \u201cGovernor Newsom needs to go back to the drawing board and tackle the state\u2019s biggest polluters head-on.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Researchers\u00a0created the first ever large-scale map of microscopic algae as they bloomed\u00a0across the surface of melting snow\u00a0 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile \" Green snow \" is spreading on the Antarctic peninsula as global temperatures rise, according to a study published today.  A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey have created the first ever large-scale map of microscopic algae as they bloom across the surface of snow along the coastline, playing an important role in the continent's ecosystem and its carbon cycling. The map provides a baseline to analyse how rapidly  Antarctica  is turning green from the impacts of  climate change . Although each of the single-cell organisms are microscopic in size, when algae densely populate the snow, it turns a vivid green across an area so large that it can be seen from space.  The scientists found that \"green snow\" will likely affect more of Antarctica's frozen landscape as global temperatures rise and create slushy conditions that allow them to bloom.  Researchers discovered that the appearance of green snow algae was strongly influenced by excrement from marine birds and mammals which acts as a natural fertiliser and accelerates algal growth. Nearly two-thirds of blooms were found within 5km of a penguin colony while other blooms appeared near bird nests and and where seals come ashore. The research was conducted by combining satellite data with the team's on-the-ground observations over two summers in Antarctica.  The green snow algae was found in \"warmer\" areas of the Antarctic Peninsula where average temperatures are just above 0 degrees Celsius during the Southern Hemisphere's summer months of November to February.  The study was published on Wednesday in the journal  Nature Communications . Dr Matt Davey, from Cambridge's Department of Plant Sciences who led the study, said: \"This is a significant advance in our understanding of land-based life on Antarctica, and how it might change in the coming years as the climate warms. \"Snow algae are a key component of the continent's ability to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.\" [The process in which plants and algae generate their own energy, using sunlight to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen]. Dr Davey added that 1,679 separate blooms of green algae were found on the snow surface, \"which together covered an area of 1.9 km2, equating to a carbon sink of around 479 tonnes per year\". This is equivalent to the amount of carbon emitted by about 875,000 car journeys. Antarctica is responding rapidly to climate changes in the region. The researchers say that the total amount of carbon held in Antarctic snow algae is likely to be much larger because carbon dioxide is also taken up by other red and orange algae which were not measured in the study. Further work is planned to measure these other algal blooms, and blooms across the entire continent.

And, in a warning to oil-producing states, it said they would face \u201can additional set of economic, fiscal and institutional credit challenges\u201d as the world moves to a  low-carbon economy . The list of the \u201cmost susceptible\u201d nations included the likes of India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Namibia, Bolivia and Honduras, according to a report by Moody's. In contrast, most of Europe, North America and China were among those considered least at risk. The report\u2019s conclusions fit with the general trend that poor countries which have done the least to cause global warming will suffer its effects the most and the nations that built their wealth on fossil fuels will fare better. \u201cWhile all countries will experience the physical effects of climate change to some degree, sovereigns [countries] with larger, more diversified economies and geographies are less susceptible,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.  \u201cThese economies generally have better infrastructure quality that can withstand disruptive events and an ability to carry a higher debt burden at more affordable interest rates.  \u201cIn contrast, those with a greater reliance on agriculture, lower incomes, weaker infrastructure quality, and smaller fiscal capacity exhibit greater susceptibility.\u201d It cited four main reasons why climate change could affect \u201ca sovereign's ability and willingness to repay its debt\u201d.  There were the potential economic impact, for example as a result of lost agricultural production; damage to infrastructure cause by floods and storms; rising social costs resulting from health or food crises; and \u201cpopulation shifts due to forced displacements resulting from climate change\u201d. But it warned the latter problem may have already helped push at least one country into war. \u201cAccording to some studies, the prolonged drought in Syria between 2006 and 2011 led to a large population displacement from rural to urban areas, a trend which contributed to the ongoing civil war,\u201d the report said. Saudi Arabia was listed as one of the \u201cleast susceptible\u201d to the effects of climate change, but Moody\u2019s said it was going to do more work on the effect of climate change on economies heavily dependent on fossil fuels. \u201cSome sovereigns, in particular oil-exporting ones, will face an additional set of economic, fiscal and institutional credit challenges over the longer term related to a transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d it said. \u201cWe plan to address the credit challenges facing sovereigns from carbon transition in a separate publication.\u201d It listed a number of problems already affecting parts of the world. \u201cIn terms of climate trends, the gradual desertification of Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan is leading to land degradation and soil infertility,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.  \u201cAccording to the Lebanese authorities, economic damage from climate change could reach more than $80 billion (156 per cent of 2015 GDP) by 2040. \u201cThe impact of a single event can be severe. The estimated value of disaster effects on Fiji\u2019s economy from Tropical Cyclone Winston in early 2016 was approximately \u2026 21 per cent of 2015 nominal GDP. \u201cFloods in Mozambique in 2015 resulted in critical damage to roads and bridges, cutting land access to almost 70 per cent of the Zamb\u00e9zia province. Downed power cables and electricity towers also left several parts of northern Mozambique without power. \u201cThe severe El Nino-driven drought in Papua New Guinea in 2015 affected more than two million people, or around one third of the population. The impact on food supply and the wider economy prompted the government to step in to buy rice, and provide drought assistance and disaster relief worth around 0.3 per cent of GDP.\u201d Reuters Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Reuters Reuters Reuters ALAIN JOCARD\/AFP\/Getty Images Reuters Climate and poverty campaigners said the report showed the need for wealthy countries to do more to help the developing world during the UN climate talks in Morocco, which began on Monday. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's climate policy lead, said: \u201cThe cruel reality of climate change is that it hits those who are least responsible for causing it and have least capacity to cope with its effects.  \u201cLow-income countries are on the frontlines of climate climate \u2013 they are most exposed and find it hardest to recover from climate shocks such as floods, droughts and heatwaves.  \u201cMany low income countries have economies that are highly reliant on agriculture, a sector that is intensely vulnerable to climatic shocks and changes.  \u201cClimate change is making development harder and more expensive, which is why urgent action is needed at [the UN climate summit] in Marrakech to increase financial support to help countries cope and adapt to their changing climates.\u201d EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA And a spokesperson for Global Justice Now said: \u201cThe history of the world\u2019s fossil fuel bingeing is fundamentally one of environmental racism. \u201cWhile it is the global north that has by far materially benefitted the most by being historically responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, it is countries in the global south that will be bearing the brunt of the rising sea levels, droughts, shifting disease patterns and so on caused by climate change.  \u201cOne of the fundamental problems of the UN climate talks is the unwillingness of Western countries to acknowledge the scale of this climate injustice and their refusal to stump up anything close to sufficient funds to financially support those countries who are going to suffer the hardest impacts.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Mr Gore,  speaking at an event  in which he previewed a sequel to his landmark 2006 documentary,  An Inconvenient Truth,  said the \u201cprincipal\u201d cause of the Syrian Civil War had been the worst drought in 900 years, which forced 1.5 million people to move from the countryside to the cities. There they met a similar number of Iraqis who had fled the conflict in their homeland, creating powder keg conditions that Syrian government officials privately feared would explode. The resulting war brought more refugees into Europe, causing political instability and helping convince some in the UK to vote to leave the European Union. One of the most controversial Leave campaign posters showed a queue of refugees stretching into the distance with the caption \u201cBreaking point: The EU has failed us all\u201d. The then-Chancellor, George Osborne, described the poster as \u201cdisgusting and vile\u201d and, like others who explicitly compared it to Nazi propaganda, said it had \u201cechoes of literature used in the 1930s\u201d. Mr Gore, whose new film  An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power  is due out in the UK in August, told an audience at the Advertising Week Europe event in London: \u201cThis collision between the power of industrial civilisation and the surprising fragility of the Earth\u2019s ecosystem now poses a great danger that could even threaten the future of human civilisation itself. \u201cOne of the lines of investigation [scientists] have been pursuing has led them to the conclusion that significant areas of the Middle East and North Africa are in danger of becoming uninhabitable. \u201cAnd, just a taste of this, to link it to some of the events that the UK and European Union are going through \u2013 think for a moment about what happened in Syria.  \u201cBefore the gates of hell opened in Syria, what happened was a climate-related extreme drought. \u201cFrom 2006 to 2010, 60 per cent of the farms in Syria were destroyed\u2026 and 80 per cent of the livestock were killed. The drought in the eastern Mediterranean is the worst ever on record \u2013 the records only go back 900 years, but it\u2019s historic. \u201cAnd 1.5 million climate refugees were driven into the cities in Syria, where they collided with refugees from the Iraq War. \u201cWikileaks revealed the internal conversations in the Syrian government where they were saying to one another \u2018we can\u2019t handle this, there\u2019s going to be a social explosion\u2019. There are other causes of the Syrian civil war, but this was the principal one.\u201d Ernie Enkelaar Aziz Kawak Aziz Kawak Ernie Enkelaar Ernie Enkelaar Aziz Kawak The war broke out in 2011 as people took to the streets during the Arab Spring protest movement against dictators in the Middle East. President Bashar Assad responded by sending in the troops. Mr Gore said this had produced an \u201cincredible flow of refugees into Europe, which is creating political instability and which contributed in some ways to the desire of some in the UK to say \u2018whoa, we\u2019re not sure we want to be part of that anymore\u2019\u201d. He said this kind of political instability was being felt by a number of countries around the world. \u201cSome countries have a hard time even in the best of seasons but the additional stress this climate crisis is causing really poses the threat of some political disruption and chaos of a kind the world would find extremely difficult to deal with,\u201d Mr Gore said. AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty This is a view shared by the current US Defence Secretary, General James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis.

The latest action has brought more attention than ever before to the group and its aims: addressing the widespread damage that is happening to the environment, and the threat of  climate change . But it has also brought new focus from critics, who argue the group is disrupting normal people\u2019s lives unnecessarily and who are not clear about what the group is trying to achieve. Extinction   Rebellion  has emerged as the premier protest movement for climate change activists. Since its first demonstration last year the group has injected fresh energy into the environmental cause, capturing headlines, recruits and high-profile supporters. Reuters Getty Reuters PA Getty PA Reuters Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP PA Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters Getty Reuters Getty AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty Getty Reuters Reuters EPA AP AFP\/Getty PA EPA EPA PA Getty  AP AFP\/Getty Reuters AP PA AP It has grown into an international movement backed by celebrities, academics and writers, calling for \u201cradical change in order to minimise the risk of human  extinction  and ecological collapse\u201d. In its first protest on October 31 last year, the group assembled a protest on Parliament Square in London, expecting a \u201ccouple of hundred people\u201d \u2013 before 1,500 showed up. The group said: \u201cThe energy was contagious! The next few weeks were a whirlwind. \u201cSix thousand of us converged on London to peacefully block five major bridges across the Thames.\u201d Chapters now exist in dozens of countries including the US, the Solomon Islands, Australia, Spain, South Africa and India, it said. On April 15 protests in London began, with campaigners saying they will bring the capital to a standstill for up to two weeks. Activists in at least 80 cities in more than 33 countries will hold similar demonstrations on environmental issues, campaigners said. Extinction Rebellion (XR) says direct action is needed to force governments to act urgently on climate change and wildlife declines and halt a \u201csixth mass extinction\u201d. It is calling for an ecological emergency to be declared, greenhouse gases to be brought to net zero by 2025, and the creation of a citizens\u2019 assembly to lead action on the environment. XR says the systems propping up \u201cmodern consumer-focused lifestyles\u201d will lead to mass water shortages, crop failures, sea level rises and the displacement of millions. \u201cOnly a peaceful planet-wide mobilisation of the scale of the Second World War will give us a chance to avoid the worst-case scenarios,\u201d it says. The aim of Extinction Rebellion has always been to cause disruption, bringing attention to their cause and hoping to force powerful people to heed their warnings about the climate. As such, the latest disruption to the transport system serves much the same function: aiming to get in the way of the normal running of the world to help raise attention to those environmental concerns. It has involved stopping trains from running as well as shutting down bridges. But the work has drawn criticism from some who claim to be sympathetic to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s cause. \u201cTargeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners\u2019 safety and I\u2019d implore anyone considering doing so to think again,\u201d Sadiq Khan wrote on Twitter.

The report found that of the 51 ads, only one had been actively removed by Facebook while the rest were allowed to run for their \u201cscheduled lifetime\u201d.\u00a0 Two ads, both from conservative nonprofit PragerU, went up on 23 January and ran to 1 October - two weeks after Facebook announced its Climate Science Information Center, a dedicated space for facts and figures from reputable source as part of the network \u201c stepping up the fight against climate change \u201d . The ad  was titled, \u201cMake no doubt about it: The hysteria over  climate change  is to sell you Big Government Control.\u201d Facebook outsources fact-checking to dozens of independent third-party groups, including Climate Feedback, who rate climate-related content. According to the  network\u2019s policies , it \u201cprohibits ads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers\u2026\u00a0 \"Advertisers that repeatedly post information deemed to be false may have restrictions placed on their ability to advertise on Facebook.\u201d In a statement, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said the new report \u201creinforces and reveals how Facebook lets climate deniers spread dangerous junk to millions of people\u201d.\u00a0 The former presidential candidate has been one of the most outspoken critics in Congress of Big Tech. During the primaries she called for breaking up the tech giants and along with Democratic colleagues, has signaled she would overhaul antitrust legislation.\u00a0 Senator Warren added: \u201cWe have repeatedly asked Facebook to close the loopholes that allow misinformation to run rampant on its platform, but its leadership would rather make a quick buck while our planet burns, sea levels rise, and communities \u2013 disproportionately Black and Brown \u2013 suffer. Facebook must be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis.\u201d In an email to  The Independent , a Facebook company spokesperson said: \"We prohibit ads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers and we are investigating the findings of this report. We work to reduce the spread of climate misinformation on Facebook and we recently launched a Climate Science Information Centre to connect people with factual information from the world\u2019s leading climate organizations.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0The new study found that the ads were mostly seen by men over the age of 55 in rural parts of the US, particularly in Texas and Wyoming.\u00a0 They were distributed to more men than women, across all age groups, the researchers discovered by using publicly-available data on Facebook\u2019s Ad Library (Google and Twitter do not disclose the same data on climate ads). The messages appeared tweaked for each audience. When an ad was directed to someone over-55, it misinformed on the \u201ccauses of climate change and credibility of the science\u201d. For the 18-34 age group, ads contested the future impacts of climate change. The report found that the ad campaigns were being created by conservative non-profits, using \u201cfunding from donor-advised trusts, which allows them to hide the source of income\u201d. The nine conservative non-profits identified spent a total of $42,000 on the 51 disinformation ads, according to the findings.\u00a0 Those groups are PragerU, The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Texas Public Policy Foundation, Turning Point USA; Capital Research Center; Washington Policy Center; Clear Energy Alliance; Competitive Enterprise Institute; and CO2 Coalition. Collectively the groups have a total revenue of $68 million per year, InfluenceMap said. The most common misinformation play was to \u201cattack the credibility of climate science and the UN\u2019s expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u201d, and deny the consensus on the climate crisis. That is, that 97 per cent or more of climate scientists  agree : climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator for Rhode Island, had joined Senator Warren in calling on Facebook to close loopholes that allowed disinformation to proliferate.\u00a0 In a statement on Thursday, he said: \u201cFor decades, polluter interests sowed false doubt and peddled lies to block climate action, screening themselves behind dark-money front groups. InfluenceMap\u2019s new report exposes the powerful role Facebook plays in enabling these disinformation campaigns. Facebook talks a good game on climate, but it makes money spreading climate denial and disinformation.\u201d The report was unable to establish why Facebook allowed the ads to run but suggested that advertisers may be exploiting the company\u2019s policy which permits \u201cindividual expression, opinions and debate.\u201d Bill Weihl, former Director of Sustainability, Facebook, and Founder of NGO ClimateVoice, said: \u201cCalling out the climate misinformation issue on Facebook is crucial because the company's limited attempts to deal with the problem are failing to keep pace with powerful tactics like micro-targeting.\u00a0 \"It's yet another attempt by Facebook to say 'we're doing some good\u2019, when the problem continues, mostly unabated.\" Nearly 1.79 billion people logged on to  Facebook  each day in the second quarter of 2020. The scale of Facebook\u2019s reach means that it hauls in 59 per cent of US political digital ad revenue, InfluenceMap reported.\u00a0 The study also found a further 30 ads which it did not view as climate disinformation but used \u201ctactics to undermine public trust in climate science\u201d.\u00a0 One suggested that environmental issues were getting better with a focus on clean air and water but omitting mention of the climate crisis. The second associated \u201cclimate science with \u2018leftist\u2019 rhetoric or the claims of \u2018alarmist\u2019 campaign groups\u201d, the study said.

Unliveable heat, ecosystem collapse, species extinction, more diseases, and cities buckling under the onslaught of rising seas are a few consequences noted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) draft report obtained by  Agence France-Presse . Even if still-rising greenhouse gas emissions, largely caused by burning fossil fuels, begin a downward slide, some of these impacts are already baked in. Communities must move much faster to prepare as \u201ccurrent levels of adaptation will be inadequate\u201d, according to AFP\u2019s report.  The IPCC\u2019s 4,000-page sixth assessment is expected to be published in portions over the next year but will not be completely available until early 2022 \u2013 after world leaders meet at the UN biodiversity summit in Kunming, China this October and the crucial climate summit in Glasgow a month later.  The climate crisis is already bringing significant change to Earth systems. At present, the average global temperature is 1.1C above the pre-industrial era. The best-case scenario based on our current trajectory would result in  3C warming by 2100 . The 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by almost every nation, pledges to curb temperature rise to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C, and aim for an increasingly ambitious 1.5C. (The World Meteorological Organization  reported in May  that the world will hit 1.5C in the next five years).  A key takeaway of the IPCC draft, according to AFP, is the danger of crossing thresholds known as \u201ctipping points\u201d, which scientists are only beginning to understand. The IPCC assessment highlights a dozen \u201ctemperature trip wires\u201d in the climate system that could cascade into potential devastating change. At 2C, the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic\u2019s ice sheets could become irreversible. They hold enough water to raise sea levels 43 feet (13 metres). Further destruction of the Amazon, which one study shows has  already \u201cflipped\u201d  and emits more carbon pollution than it stores, could see it transformed into savannah. In Siberia, the rapid thawing of the vast, carbon-rich, underground layer of ice and frozen dirt called  permafrost  is causing the region to warm faster than almost anywhere else on Earth, spewing billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Life on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems. Humans cannot. \u201cLife on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems,\u201d the draft reportedly reads. \u201cHumans cannot.\u201d The IPCC\u2019s sixth assessment offers a stark choice: The decisions that nations make now will determine whether our species thrives or life becomes simply a matter of survival in the coming century. \u201cThe worst is yet to come, affecting our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s lives much more than our own,\u201d says the report, according to AFP. The report also underlines that humans continue to wreak havoc on some of our greatest allies in combatting global heating like the ocean and forests. Climate activist  Greta Thunberg told AFP  that while the IPCC draft assessment confirmed that the \u201cthe situation is very dire\u201d and urgent action was needed, she was also hopeful it \u201ccould wake people up\u201d. \u201cWe can of course not face this crisis unless we tell it like it is, unless we are adult enough to tell the truth, and to face the reality,\u201d Ms Thunberg said. The UN\u2019s draft assessment also emphasises that there is still much that can be done to avoid the worst impacts. Individual actions are important but \u201ctransformational change\u201d is needed at all levels including businesses, institutions and governments, according to the report. The draft report recommends better protection and restoration of \u201cblue carbon ecosystems\u201d, such as kelp and mangrove sea forests, which not only protect coastal communities from storm surges and create wildlife habitats but are effective at soaking up carbon. As agriculture, forestry and other land use currently account for about 25 per cent of global emissions, the IPCC draft reports that a global shift to more plant-based diets could reduce emissions from the food sector by as much as 70 per cent by 2050. In a statement to The Independent,  the IPCC said it was unable to comment as the report is not yet final and will go through further changes.  The IPCC added that the final approved and accepted version of the report is planned for release in February 2022, and at that point earlier drafts will also be issued.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Planet much\u00a0more sensitive to fossil-fuel emissions than past studies have shown, scientists say Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The world\u2019s  oceans  have absorbed far more heat than previously estimated, suggesting  global warming  and  climate change  could accelerate faster than predicted, according to new research.  The results suggest over the past 27 years, the world\u2019s oceans have retained 60 per cent more heat each year than research teams had previously thought. This represents an enormous amount of additional energy stored on Earth, indicating the planet is far more sensitive to fossil-fuel emissions than past studies have shown. It also raises further serious doubts over whether current temperature goals \u2013 to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 are attainable. If accurate, the study is likely to have a major impact on climate modelling, which has largely used lower estimates for the amount of energy stored in the oceans.  Most previous models for ocean heat uptake have used data taken from the Argo Float programme, in which about 4,000 buoys drifting at around 1,000m below the surface of the oceans take temperature and other readings. It has been fully operational since 2007. Issues with the system are that it only measures the upper part of the ocean, and there remain huge gaps in coverage. But the new study provides a separate estimate with data going back to 1991, and uses \u201cdependable\u201d measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 levels of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases \u2013 as a \u201cwhole-ocean thermometer\u201d, the authors wrote. The study,  published in the journal  Nature , says the world\u2019s oceans took up more than 13 zettajoules \u2013 which is a joule, the standard unit of energy, followed by 21 zeroes \u2013 of heat energy each year between 1991 and 2016. This amounts to the oceans absorbing an amount of heat energy 150 times greater than the energy humans produce as electricity annually, over each year of the past quarter of a century. \u201cWe thought that we got away with not a lot of warming in both the ocean and the atmosphere for the amount of CO2 that we emitted,\u201d lead author Dr Laure Resplandy of Princeton University, told  The Washington Post .  \u201cBut we were wrong. The planet warmed more than we thought. It was hidden from us just because we didn\u2019t sample it right. But it was there. It was in the ocean already.\u201d   Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters REUTERS Reuters REUTERS Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters The study comes three weeks after scientists from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) commissioned by the United Nations  issued  the most urgent and far-reaching call yet  for world governments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and stop global warming. \u201cIt is a big concern,\u201d Dr Resplandy said. \u201cIf you look at the IPCC 1.5C, there are big challenges ahead to keep those targets, and our study suggests it\u2019s even harder because we close the window for those lower pathways,\u201d  she told the BBC .  Scientists already know the ocean takes up roughly 90 per cent of all excess energy produced as the Earth warms, so calculating the actual amount of energy makes it possible to estimate the level of surface warming we can expect, said the study\u2019s co-author Ralph Keeling, a Scripps Oceanography geophysicist. \u201cThe result significantly increases the confidence we can place in estimates of ocean warming and therefore helps reduce uncertainty in the climate sensitivity, particularly closing off the possibility of very low climate sensitivity,\u201d Professor Keeling said. The findings suggest if governments are to prevent temperatures from rising above 2C, emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas produced by human activities, must be reduced by 25 per cent compared to what was previously estimated, Dr Resplandy said.

Jordan Peterson announced that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as climate\u201d and that \u201cclimate and everything are the same word\u201d during a four-hour interview on  The Joe Rogan Experience , posted on Tuesday. Dr Peterson, who resigned from a tenured professorship at the University of Toronto last week partly over the institution\u2019s mandates on  diversity, inclusivity and equity , has written a number of self-help books. He has garnered a large social media following (his YouTube channel alone has 4.5million subscribers) for his  anti-political correctness views,  arguments that white privilege isn\u2019t real , and  defense of the patriarchy .  In the latest Joe Rogan episode, the conversation began with Dr Peterson asking the podcast host how he prepares for interviews. Mr Rogan responded that he usually read the person\u2019s book, explaining that he was currently reading a \u201cclimate change book\u201d, calling it \u201cintense\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s requiring a lot of thinking, and then I have to like look at the criticisms of this guy and criticisms of the work,\u201d Mr Rogan said. \u201cWho believes in 10 years that Miami is going to be underwater, who believes that this is probably hyperbole and that it\u2019s a gross exaggeration and the reality is the world sort of always goes through these cycles of change but human beings are definitely having an effect on it, but a small effect compared to cows and other things \u2026 the climate change one is a weird one.\u201d A survey of 88,12 climate studies,  published last year  in  Environmental Research  , found that more than 99.9 per cent of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that the  climate crisis  is mainly caused by humans. \u201cWe are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99 per cent now and that it\u2019s pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change,\u201d Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and the paper\u2019s lead author, told  The Cornell Chronicle  in October. On Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, Dr Peterson, who is not a climate scientist, claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as climate.\u201d He was asked by Mr Rogan to explain, so he launched into an obtuse theory.  \u201cClimate and everything are the same word, and that\u2019s what bothers me about the climate change types. It\u2019s like, this is something that bothers me about it, technically. It\u2019s like climate is about everything. OK. But your models aren\u2019t based on everything. Your models are based on a set number of variables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that means you\u2019ve reduced the variables \u2013 which are everything \u2013 to that set. Well, how did you decide which set of variables to include in the equation if it\u2019s about everything?... Because your models do not and cannot model everything.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by everything?\u201d Rogan then asked. \u201cWe have to change everything \u2026 The same with the word environment,\u201d Mr Peterson continued. \u201cThat word means so much that it actually doesn\u2019t mean anything. Like when you say everything, like in a sense that\u2019s meaningless. What\u2019s the difference between the environment and everything? There\u2019s no difference.\u201d Peterson then asked the question: \u201cSo this is a crisis of everything?\u201d before providing his own answer. \u201cIt\u2019s like, no, it\u2019s not. Or if it is, if it really is, then we\u2019re done because we can\u2019t fix everything.\u201d At one point, the Mr Rogan acknowledges that his guest \u201cwent on these rants\u201d but continues the conversation on climate change. The episode meanders into a discussion on energy sources, where Peterson alleges, with zero factual basis, that \u201cmore people die every year from solar energy than die from nuclear\u201d. \u201cWho dies from solar?\u201d Rogan asked. \u201cGuess how you die from solar?\u201d Dr Peterson says, with a laugh.  \u201cSunburn?\u2019\u201d Rogan asks. \u201cNo, you fall off the roof when you're installing it ... gravity,\u201d Peterson replied, describing it as a \u201cgood example of unintended consequences\u201d. He also at one point claims that fracking has not polluted water supplies. ( Numerous studies  have repeatedly documented the risk to water supplies from the drilling technique). The Independent  has contacted both Spotify and Dr Peterson for comment on the climate misinformation. Spotify has 345 million monthly active users, according to  Soundcharts.com . Rogan has an exclusive podcast deal for a  reported $100million with the streaming service. The episode was lambasted by a number of climate experts and distinguished scientists. Dr Michael Mann, Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of Earth System Science Center at Penn State University and a National Academy of Sciences member, said he had listened to some of the podcast and that \u201cthe bit that I heard made me dumber\u201d. \u201cAs I understand Jordan Peterson\u2019s argument, it\u2019s \u2018the climate is complicated. it\u2019s got lots of components. so we can never model it or understand it,\u2019\u201d Dr Mann wrote in an email. \u201cThe argument betrays either a total lack of understanding of how science works (or, more likely, a total disdain for his audience and an intention to disinform). It could be used to dismiss physics, chemistry, biology, and every other field of science where one formulates (and rigorously  tests  \u2013 the part Peterson conveniently ignores) conceptual models that attempt to distill the key components of a particular system and the interactions between those components.  \u201cEvery great discovery in science (including the physics that allowed Peterson and Rogan to record and broadcast their ridiculous conversation) has arisen through that process. \u201cSo Jordan (and Rogan, who facilities the spread of this misinformation by subjecting his viewers to this nonsense) has essentially dismissed the very notion of scientific discovery.\u201d Professor Mann added: \u201cThis almost comedic type of nihilism would be funny if it weren\u2019t killing people (Peterson and Rogan\u2019s antiscientific rhetoric about Covid-19 almost certainly has and will continue to lead to large numbers of human deaths).\u201d Meanwhile, Dr Sam Gregson, a  University of Cambridge  physicist who works on the  Large Hadron Collider  experiment at CERN in Switzerland, tweeted: \u201cJordan Peterson explains why nothing can be modelled and physics doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m going to need a new career.\u201d Amy Westervelt, an investigative journalist who runs climate change podcast Drilled, also posted: \u201cI guess I know the answer to this but why is anyone asking Jordan Peterson about climate change in the first place? THIS IS WHY LEGIT SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO ACTUALLY RESEARCH CLIMATE NEED MORE ATTENTION AND FUNDING jfc.\u201d The news site Mediaite dubbed the interview \u201cwhackadoo\u201d while author Daniel Pinchbeck noted: \u201cClimate change is not \u2018hard to sort out\u2019. We put over 30 billion tons of CO2 into the air every year, causing a rise in CO2 and temperatures. Climate change is not synonymous with \u2018everything.\u2019 This is pathetic.\u201d Spotify announced in December that \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d was its Number 1 podcast globally in 2021. The streaming site did not respond to  The Independent\u2019s  question on how many people had listened to Tuesday\u2019s episode. Rogan, who is also a standup comedian and a UFC commentator, drew the ire of doctors and scientists over his recent podcast interview with Dr Robert Malone. The infectious disease specialist has been banned from Twitter for spreading misinformation but has become a hero in the anti-vaccine community after he questioned the Covid vaccine\u2019s effectiveness, and falsely suggested that millions of people had been hypnotised into believing that the  vaccines  work to prevent serious disease. A group of doctors and scientists signed an online petition calling on Spotify to adopt policies to prevent the spread of misinformation on its platform. On Monday, singer-songwriter Neil Young posted a letter on his website demanding that Spotify remove his music in protest of Rogan spreading vaccine misinformation. However the letter was later taken down, and the rock star\u2019s music remains on the streaming platform.

Primates and marsupials are believed to have the most individual species suffering as a result of global warming, according to a paper in the journal  Nature Climate Change .  Only two groups of mammals, rodents and insect-eaters, are thought to have benefited. This is partly because they have fast breeding rates, tend not to be specialists suited to a particular habitat, and often live in burrows which provide insulation against changes in the weather. The figures are much higher than previously thought, making up 47 per cent of land mammals and 23 per cent of the birds on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of species threatened with extinction. According to the list itself, just seven per cent of the mammals and four per cent of the birds are described as being threatened by \u201cclimate change and severe weather\u201d. The researchers developed a model to compare the animals\u2019 weight and other characteristics with changes in the climate, such as the temperature. \u201cUsing this model, we estimated that 47 per cent of terrestrial [non-flying] threatened mammals (out of 873 species) and 23.4 per cent of threatened birds (out of 1,272 species) may have already been negatively impacted by climate change in at least part of their distribution,\u201d the article in Nature Climate Change said. \u201cOur results suggest that populations of large numbers of threatened species are likely to be already affected by climate change, and that conservation managers, planners and policy makers must take this into account in efforts to safeguard the future of biodiversity.\u201d Primates and marsupials are more at risk than other animals partly because they have lived mostly in tropical parts of the world which have had a stable climate for thousands of years. \u201cMany of these [animals] have evolved to live within restricted environmental tolerances and are likely to be most affected by rapid changes and extreme events,\u201d the paper added. \u201cIn addition, primates and elephants are characterised by very slow reproductive rates that reduce their ability to adapt to rapid changes in environmental conditions.\u201d One reason why climate change is causing a problem for animals is changes in the distribution of plants. \u201cIn areas with reduced precipitation and\/or temperature seasonality, it is likely that plant species may have narrower climatic tolerances, and therefore that these areas may have already experienced vegetation changes with consequential loss of habitat for animals living there,\u201d the paper said.  Alamy Alamy Alamy \u201cA more specialised diet was also associated with greater probability of negative responses in mammals.  \u201cOur findings are in agreement with previous studies on the predictors of general extinction risk, in which species with narrower diet breadths were associated with lower ability to exploit resources and adapt to new environmental conditions and selective pressures.\u201d Birds living in the world\u2019s cold mountain regions appear to be particularly at risk. \u201cPopulations of species living at high altitudes and in colder places have fewer opportunities to move towards cooler areas or upslope to avoid increasing temperatures, and hence may have increased extinction risk,\u201d the paper said. Another problem is that higher temperatures are inducing birds to lay eggs earlier. \u201cFor animals living in these environments the effects of temperature changes may have been exacerbated, potentially leading to disruption in synchronisation between the timing of chick-feeding and peak food availability,\u201d the paper said.

The former governor of California claimed the state\u2019s wealth and job creation proves carbon dioxide reduction does not affect economic success \u2013 and can in fact help the global economy. The Terminator actor told the  BBC : \"They are liars, they are stupid. Or they don\u2019t know how to do it, because we figured how to do it and it\u2019s all about having the balls to do it.\u201d Since leaving political office in 2011, the Austrian-American actor has devoted time to environmental causes. As a Republican, he sparred with former President\u00a0 Donald Trump \u00a0over climate issues. Speaking just ahead of the\u00a0 Cop26  climate summit,\u00a0Schwarzenegger also took aim at the air pollution and greenhouse gases generated by shipping and urged consumers to shop local.

Every time you buy something from overseas, that is evil for the environment - this is like the worst thing you can do.\" The Terminator star says humans can \u2018terminate\u2019 climate change  During his tenure as governor of California, Schwarzenegger worked to pass the Global Warming Solutions Act to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, as well as other renewable energy and low carbon initiatives. After leaving office in 2011, he continued to promote state and local clean energy efforts by campaigning and through the work of the Schwarzenegger Institute at the University of Southern California. At the Austrian World Summit earlier this year, Schwarzenegger argued that the public perceives the environmental movement as being \u201cstuck in despair and confusion,\u201d and using language that goes over people\u2019s heads. He argued that activists need to zero in on one message: \u201c Pollution \u00a0is enemy number one... it is the very thing that causes climate change.\u201d \u201cHumans can solve it \u2014 we can kill it, we can terminate it,\u201d he said.

The  Met Office  has said a warming climate will lead to more  heatwaves  and hotter evenings, which could have an impact on people\u2019s health. Four tropical nights have been recorded in the UK so far this year, with three occurring since 8 August and one on 25 June. \u201cWith climate change and a warming climate, we will see more tropical nights,\u201d Nicola Maxey, a Met Office spokesperson, said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. Heatwaves are more likely and so as well as more days, we are going to see warmer nights.\u201d Ms Maxey added that between 1961 and 1990 there were 44 nights where temperatures did not drop below 20C, although these were mostly associated with heatwaves in 1976 and 1983. Since 1991, there have been a further 84 tropical nights. This month\u2019s heatwave is due to continue over the coming days, with temperatures forecast to remain in the mid-30s in the south east of  England  on Wednesday. However, thunderstorms and heavy rain are also forecast to bring further flooding to parts of England and  Scotland , with a yellow weather warning for storms in place for most of the UK until Thursday evening. The Met Office has said up to 40mm (1.6 inches) of rain could fall within an hour in parts of northeast England and up to 80mm (3.1 inches) in three hours. The  Environment Agency  has issued five flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, for parts of Birmingham and its surrounding districts. Flood alerts have also been issued for 17 locations in Scotland, with one alert for the Vyrnwy catchment area in  Wales . The UK recorded its hottest August day in 17 years on Friday, one week after recording a temperature of 37.8C on 31 July \u2014 the third warmest day in the country on record. Michael Byrne, a lecturer in earth and environmental sciences at the University of St Andrews, said last week that high temperatures were \u201cnot surprising\u201d due to the impact of climate change. \u201cBreaking temperature records year on year will absolutely keep happening, unless we take drastic action against climate change that\u2019s a certainty,\u201d Mr Byrne said. The Met Office has said temperatures are forecast to fall slightly to 30C in London on Thursday, before dropping again to about 26C on Friday.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Economic growth could prompt greater greenhouse gas emissions than previously forecast, study says Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Scientists may have to recalibrate their projections of what a \u201cworst case\u201d  climate change  scenario is, as new studies take into account greater global economic growth than previously forecast. Climate scientists forecasting how the earth\u2019s climate will change over time examine trends in greenhouse gas emissions, which are largely dependent on how the global economy behaves. As countries get richer, the amount they consume goes up, and so too do greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists use four scenarios called representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that attempt to depict possible futures for our planet. The standard worst case scenario, RCP 8.5, assumes rapid and unrestricted economic growth which will see rampant burning of fossil fuels. In addition, it also assumes no further action will be taken to limit warming than the policies countries are already pursuing. However, scientists at the University of Illinois say there is a one-in-three chance that by the end of the century emissions will have exceeded those estimated in the RCP 8.5 scenario.  \u201cOur estimates indicate that, due to higher than assumed economic growth rates, there is a greater than 35 per cent probability that year 2100 emissions concentrations will exceed those given by RCP8.5,\u201d Peter Christensen told the  New Scientist . Glen Peters of the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway points to the rise in  carbon emissions  in Europe over the past four years as economic growth has sped up. In 2017, EU emissions rose by 1.8 per cent. However, the worst case scenario remains unlikely as economic growth does not rule out environmentally-beneficial policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve already locked in a certain amount of climate policy,\u201d Mr Peters said.  Nonetheless, the latest research also means higher levels of emissions may now have to be factored in to the other climate scenarios. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Numerous climate models have previously predicted an apocalyptic future for existence on earth. From rapid icecap melt and catastrophic sea level rise, to rising temperatures making some areas uninhabitable, and mass extinctions of species in affected areas. But even our best efforts may not be enough to avert disaster.  The  Paris climate agreement  commits the world\u2019s countries to preventing global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial temperatures by the end of the century.  However, even if all countries meet their non-binding targets, some projections estimate global temperatures could still rise by more than 3C, and possibly by over 4C. This would have a devastating effect on the planet, raising sea levels as much as 1.5 metres, putting cities like Amsterdam and New York under water and causing widespread famine.

A  paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters  said natural climate variations in the Pacific which change over a period of decades may have provided a \u201ctemporary buffer\u201d to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing extreme events such as heatwaves. But this cycle, called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), could be about to flip or may have already done so, sending temperatures higher for the next 10 to 20 years. Under the Paris Agreement, the world decided to \u201cpursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels\u201d. However, the researchers said the combination of a natural warming phase and human carbon emissions could see temperatures reach this point by 2026. Last year, the  hottest on record for the third time in a row , was 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than the average between 1850 and 1900, according to separate research by the Met Office and Nasa. That prompted Professor Gabi Hegerl, a world-leading climatologist at Edinburgh University, to warn that it was \"getting tight for avoiding dangerous climate change\". However the natural El Nino effect was estimated to have contributed about 0.2C to this figure. The IPO,  described as \u2018El Nino\u2019s uncle\u2019 , affects the weather over a much longer period. In the paper, the researchers wrote the 21st century\u2019s first decade had been \u201cunder the influence of a negative IPO phase\u201d. \u201cThis may have provided a temporary buffer for the radiative forcing effect of continually rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations on global temperatures,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is therefore possible that a negative phase of the IPO since the turn of the century has cushioned the impacts of global warming on extreme events, such as heatwaves. \u201cA turnaround of the IPO to its positive phase could initiate a period of accelerated warming over the next one or two decades. \u201cThis would likely lead to the Paris target of 1.5C being surpassed within the next decade.\u201d Even without the effect of the IPO, the scientists said that global mean temperatures were expected to \u201cpass the 1.5C warming mark within the next 10 to 15 years\u201d under a \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 scenario for greenhouse gas emissions as a result of human activity. They suggested that, while world might go beyond the 1.5C target, it could still get back to that figure. \u201cEquilibrating the Earth\u2019s climate at 1.5C above the pre-industrial level will involve overshooting the target and then reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperatures on a net negative carbon emissions pathway,\u201d the paper said. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan One of the researchers, Dr Benjamin Henley, of Melbourne University,  told the Carbon Brief website  that it was too soon to say if the IPO had actually shifted, although there was some evidence from computer models that this would happen soon or had already begun. And he stressed trying to understand the natural cycle was a difficult business. \u201cIt remains a significant challenge to reliably predict long-term variations in ocean circulation, due to data limitations and the inherently chaotic nature of the ocean-atmosphere system,\" Dr Henley said. Scientists had long thought restricting global warming to 2C would avoid dangerous effects of climate change \u2013 heatwaves, droughts, floods, increased storms and rising sea levels. But the Paris Agreement introduced the 1.5C target amid suggestions that going beyond this level could lock in irreversible sea level rise caused by melting land ice in Antarctica and Greenland for centuries. Commenting on the research, Professor Richard Betts, a Met Office fellow and chair of climate impacts at Exeter University, said it was important to keep the paper\u2019s conclusions \u201cin perspective\u201d.  \u201cWe should not expect major impacts in 10 years\u2019 time, but we should not be complacent either,\u201d he wrote in an email to The Independent. \u201cIn the first year at 1.5C, events like flooding, drought and other extreme weather may not be very much different from now.  \u201cBut as the world warms further, longer-term effects will become apparent, especially ongoing sea level rise as glaciers continue to melt.  \u201cThe full impacts will take decades to play out, but once set in motion they could be hard to reverse.\u201d The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has commissioned  an expert report into the effects of 1.5C of global warming , which is due to be published in 2018.

Newton Upper Falls could show him a thing or two, writes  Louise Boyle   Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Joe Rogan moved to Newton Upper Falls in Massachusetts and attended high school in the small town outside of Boston. Like most of the Northeast, its feeling acute climate impacts  A t Newton South High, close to Boston, a wave of urgent action has swept through the hallways.  \u201cAll across the school, there are groups of students working to educate themselves and others about climate change,\u201d wrote reporter Eve Cohen in  The Denebola , one of Newton South\u2019s two student newspapers.  Like young people across the US and beyond, Newton students marched in the 2019 global climate strikes. Afterwards, they worked to reduce plastic waste in the cafeteria, improve recycling and learn about the issues. Junior biology classes adopted \u201cClimate Change Friday\u201d with students taking turns to present a topic. \u201cTheir end goal is to actually do an action, make a difference that will be long-lasting at Newton South,\u201d Molly Estrada, a biology teacher, told the student paper, adding that, \u201cif every school did that, you\u2019d start to really see a change in our whole country\u201d. Newton South sits in the top  3 per cent of public schools  in the country and has some wildly successful past alumni.  Roger Myerson , a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, is a former student along with  Jonathan Mann , a leading figure at the World Health Organization who spearheaded early AIDS research. There\u2019s actors  John Krasinski  and BJ Novak, actress and model Hari Nef, and director Eli Roth. And Spotify\u2019s podcasting superstar, Joe Rogan. Joseph James Rogan was born in Newark, New Jersey, and moved to California and Florida before his family settled in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts, where he attended Newton South. Spotify podcaster Joe Rogan pictured in his high school year book in 1985 \u201cI learned 2 wrongs only make a right if you don\u2019t get caught, and life is too important to be taken seriously,\u201d he quipped in his Class of 1985 yearbook. His Newton South successors could offer a few lessons to Spotify\u2019s $100m man, who currently finds himself at the centre of a controversy on misinformation, including an episode last week which waded into the murky waters of climate denial. During a lengthy interview on  The Joe Rogan Experience , Dr  Jordan Peterson , a clinical psychologist famous for his  anti-political correctness views, attacks on the trans community,  arguments that white privilege isn\u2019t real , and  defence of the patriarchy,  aired his views to an audience (of an estimated 11million people) that climate science has no basis in reality, and that solar power kills more people than nuclear, with little pushback from the host. Dr Peterson subsequently cited a book by S Fred Singer, as his source material. Singer, who died in 2020, founded the Science and Environment Policy Project, a climate-sceptic advocacy group with financial support from the Heartland Institute, a think-tank backed by oil interests, ExxonMobil, and the Koch family, as  Desmog reported.  Contrary to the scientific consensus, Singer dubbed human-caused emissions \u201ctrivial\u201d and claimed climate models were \u201calarmist\u201d. Dr Peterson did not respond to a request for comment from  The Independent  about his statements on climate change. The remarks compounded a mounting crisis for Spotify over Covid misinformation on Mr Rogan\u2019s show which is exclusive to the company.  After an open letter signed by hundreds of doctors and public health professionals did little to make Spotify address the issue, rock veteran Neil Young last week asked the company to remove his music, followed by  Joni Mitchell, Young\u2019s former  bandmate Graham Nash  and Bruce Springsteen guitarist  Nils Lofgren . Best-selling author  Brene Brown  has suspended her exclusive Spotify podcast \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. Singer-songwriter India.Arie asked for her music to be removed due to Mr Rogan\u2019s \u201cproblematic language around race\u201d. During the discussion with Dr Peterson, Mr Rogan also talked about climate change, noting that he was currently reading an \u201cintense\u201d book on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s requiring a lot of thinking, and then I have to like look at the criticisms of this guy and criticisms of the work,\u201d Mr Rogan said. \u201cWho believes in 10 years that Miami is going to be underwater, who believes that this is probably hyperbole and that it\u2019s a gross exaggeration and the reality is the world sort of always goes through these cycles of change but human beings are definitely having an effect on it, but a small effect compared to cows and other things \u2026 the climate change one is a weird one.\u201d Climate scientists responded with dismay to the episode. \u201cSimilar anti-science spread by these two individuals about COVID-19 likely has and will continue to lead to fatalities,\u201d Dr Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, told  CNN . \u201cEven more will perish from extremely dangerous and deadly weather extremes if we fail to act on the climate crisis. So the promotion of misinformation about climate change is in some ways even more dangerous.\u201d Boston University Professor Nathan Phillips, a physiological ecologist who studies land-climate interactions and lives in the Newton area, said that Mr Rogan \u201ccould be doing a lot better than pandering to fake controversy\u201d. Professor Phillips is a fierce critic of building new fossil fuel infrastructure, taking part in ongoing local campaigns of nonviolent civil disobedience. In 2020, he went on hunger strike to draw attention to public health and safety concerns at a controversial gas compressor station in Weymouth, south of Boston. \u201cWe just can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d he told  The Independent  this week. \u201cThe science, the facts, and the environmental justice is clear. No one wants it, except for a very few corporate interests. Instead of Joe Rogan distracting us with the climate denial, let\u2019s work on resilient communities.\u201d The Independent  has contacted both Mr Rogan and Spotify for comment. In response to the furore, Mr Rogan posted an Instagram video on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to promote misinformation. I\u2019m not trying to be controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried to do anything with this podcast other than just talk to people and have interesting conversations.\u201d He noted that he would \u201ctry harder to get people with differing opinions\u201d and \u201cdo my best to make sure I\u2019ve researched these topics\u201d. While research published in  99.9 per cent of peer-reviewed scientific papers  agree that  climate change  is real and mainly caused by humans, for a real-world distillation of the climate crisis Mr Rogan need look no further than his former Beantown backyard, where the challenges are piling up. Mr Rogan, 54, spent his teenage years in in Newton Upper Falls. He lived in a large, wooden-clad home near Echo Bridge which spans the Charles River in a scenic area known as Hemlock Gorge. Originally a mill village, Newton Upper Falls is now largely protected as a historic area and is among  the 15 per cent highest-income neighbourhoods in America . For the town, as is true across the US, climate change can be viewed through a local lens and as part of a much bigger picture. Data gathered at the Blue Hill Observatory near Newton, Massachusetts shows the rise in annual temperature over almost 200 years In the Northeast, the last few decades are the warmest in the past 1,500 years and the region is heating up faster than the global average.  Average annual temperatures have increased about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) or more in New England since 1901, according to the latest  National Climate Assessment (NCA) , a congressionally-mandated report which involves work from hundreds of scientists.  Newton\u2019s heat is rising in line with the broader region, according to data gathered from the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, less than 10 miles from the town. \u201cIn urban communities, heat can be a significant threat to human health, particularly in marginalised and under-resourced communities,\u201d Dr Heather Goldstone, from the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts told  The Independent . Along with increased heat, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and leads to greater humidity. The combination can be lethal: particularly as heatwaves are now lasting longer and failing to cool off at night, amplifying health risks. More heat and humidity makes it difficult for people who live with respiratory conditions, and vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, the sick, and the poor.  A 2020 study,  led by Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health, found that thousands of US deaths may be attributable to heat each year, far more than the 600 deaths previously estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Higher temperatures can also drive more insect-borne diseases, EPA notes. There is more likelihood of people being exposed to ticks that transmit Lyme disease (which are active when temperatures top 45F) and excessive heat also makes more of New England hot enough for the Asian tiger mosquito, a carrier of West Nile virus.  Temperature increases will have potential consequences for some of New England\u2019s most iconic industries. \u201cChanges in fall weather are impacting cranberry production and maple syrup production,\u201d Dr Goldstone says. \u201cChanges in winter temperatures and snowfall impacts the ski industry further north. \u201cOn Cape Cod, it\u2019s hard to go fishing for cod now. In large part that\u2019s because of overfishing but climate change is thought to be playing a significant role in why cod fisheries are not responding to [catch] limits, and not rebounding as expected. \u201cMore than half of commercially-fished species have shifted from where they are found in the ocean as a result of increasing water temperatures off our coast.\u201d Then there\u2019s the rain. The Northeast has seen among the most dramatic increases in extreme precipitation of anywhere in the country, leading to more dangerous and destructive flooding. Rainfall in Boston has jumped 10 per cent since the Seventies and there has been a 71 per cent increase in how much rain falls in the top 1 per cent of storms. A decade ago, severe downpours in Newton led to millions of dollars in damages and disrupted service on the Green Line of Boston\u2019s light rail system. A third of city facilities flooded, according to a City of Newton climate change vulnerability assessment in 2018. \u201cAs rainfall amounts increase, rain events similar to 2010 will become more frequent. A one-thousand year event would nearly double the rainfall experienced over three days in March 2010,\u201d Newton\u2019s researchers wrote. A steady march of hurricanes and superstorms \u2013 Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Maria, Ida \u2013 have led to the loss of lives and livelihoods across the Northeast.  The fingerprint of the climate crisis is in this extreme weather. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s leading authority on  climate  science, found that storms with sustained higher wind speeds \u2013 in the Category 3-5 range \u2013 have likely increased in the past 40 years. The ocean is absorbing  over 90 per cent of excess heat  trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, primarily caused by burning of fossil fuels. All that warm water feeds into hurricane power. Annual risk of flooding by 2070 in Newton, Massachusetts \u201cAs is evident from Hurricane Harvey, damage and suffering from such an extreme event is severe. Indeed, flooding or extreme heat, and the resultant potential for power outages can have devastating and cascading effects during far lesser storms than a one-in-one-thousand-year occurrence,\u201d Newton\u2019s climate report states. This August, Tropical Storm Fred brought another bout of flash-flooding across Boston leaving dozens of people stuck in submerged vehicles. In one terrifying snapshot from Newton, a driver narrowly escaped via his sunroof when a small brook suddenly became a powerful torrent and swept his car away. More rainfall in Newton has raised concerns about the 12 dams that surround the area and were \u201cmost likely designed based on historic weather patterns\u201d. More rain could mean potential breaches or failures of these dams, some of which were first built centuries ago. \u201cIn many instances, potential impacts of a warming climate do not prompt entirely new challenges, but rather, exacerbate existing concerns,\u201d Newton\u2019s assessment sagely points out. More frequent and intense rainfall could increase flooding and stormwater hazards in a town where they are already concerns. Predictably, areas of greatest concern are along waterways including the Charles River, Bullough\u2019s Pond and number of smaller brooks that flow through town, but also less-obvious places with poor drainage. During a serious storm in 2010, more than 700 homes and 25 city buildings were damaged, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency records. \u201cCity officials suggest that the number of homes affected by flooding may have been closer to 2,000,\u201d Newton\u2019s report notes. Increased vulnerability to flooding has economic repercussions, too, particularly if it puts highways and public transport out of bounds. Eight in 10 workers who live in Newton commute to their jobs, with roughly a third heading for downtown Boston.  For coastal communities, more rain and flash floods are a double whammy with increased sea-level rise and shoreline erosion. In tourist-magnet towns along Massachusetts cherished coastline, climate impacts put at risk the infrastructure they need to operate: highways, rail lines, parking lots, pavilions, boardwalks along with \u201ccultural landscapes and historic structures\u201d. Saltwater intrusion poses a threat to drinking water supplies. Waves crash over oceanfront homes during a noreaster in Scituate, Massachusetts, on January 29, 2022. Climate change is making storms more powerful compounding coastal issues of sea-level rise and erosion For Boston, the total cost of storm damages this century could range from $5bn to $100bn, depending on how the city responds to rising sea level, the  US Environmental Protection Agency  reports. Newton also warns that extreme weather could lead to financial shocks for residents and business owners due to disruption, reduced spending, property damages and loss. Some 40 per cent of Newton\u2019s businesses are located in areas that suffer from particularly high temperatures, a specific concern for the estimated 1,800 people in the area who work outside. \u201cThe really important thing to realise is that the impacts of climate change at this point are pervasive impacts on people\u2019s lives and their livelihoods. They are widespread and undeniable,\u201d Dr Goldstone said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that reflected in public opinion. People are realising, \u2018Oh this is climate change and it is impacting my daily life where I live.\u2019\u201d Dr Goldstone pointed to the recent NOAA study which found that weather and climate disaster events resulted in the deaths of 688 people in 2021. \u201cThis is not just about dollars and cents, it\u2019s really about people\u2019s lives,\u201d she added. While the city of Boston has developed a reputation as a leader in progressive climate action, neighbouring Newton is no shirker in this regard. The city has developed a five-year action plan through to 2025 titled \u201c Use Less and Green the Res t\u201d with an eye to carbon neutrality by 2050. Among the plans are boosting clean energy with municipal solar arrays and promoting rooftop solar among residents.  Newton\u2019s residents, workforce, and visitors will be supported in switching to electric vehicles alongside plans to install EV charging stations in village centres, schools, and other municipal sites. Biking, walking, telecommuting, public transport, and shared trips will be encouraged over single driver journeys, and supported with infrastructure.  New construction will have to meet carbon neutrality standards while old buildings will be refitted with energy efficient technology to reduce natural gas and heating oil use. At the same time, protecting natural resources and reducing consumption and waste is high on the priorities. Prof Phillips noted that as a town, Newton is \u201cvery engaged\u201d on climate but said that even in the most progressive places, there remains much more work to be done. He advocates for the \u201cdemocratisation of energy\u201d - making people less reliant on centralised power grids and upping localised renewable options like individual or community solar panels and increasing battery storage. It also includes a shift from gas-powered vehicles, not just to electric cars but bikes and e-bikes. \u201cHuman-powered resilience for mobility, for example, if there\u2019s a big gasoline spike,\u201d he explained. Prof Phillips cited the example of Texas (where, incidentally, Mr Rogan now lives in a  $20m mansion outside of Austin ). The Lone Star state last year suffered a grid-wide power outage which left more than 200 people dead during a historic deep freeze (Texas is facing more extreme cold this week, with all eyes once again looking at how the power grid will hold up). With so much at stake, Prof Phillips says that Mr Rogan using his platform for climate misinformation is a missed opportunity. \u201cJoe Rogan could focus on these huge, unifying solutions rather than taking the easy way out and getting clicks with climate denial which just sets us back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seems energetic, creative and engaged. He could use that in so much more of a constructive way.\u201d  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Such a target would be in line with the ambitious targets laid out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recent report, which revealed unprecedented changes were needed across society to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Meanwhile, one of the UK's biggest energy suppliers has completely dropped fossil fuels in favour of wind power - setting the agenda for the nation's future power supply - and the three activists jailed for protesting against fracking have been freed. Here you can follow the latest climate change news from the UK and around the world after scientists urged nation's to take action last week. Please allow a moment for the live blog to load Scottish Power says it is giving us a taste of the future as it sells off its fossil fuel assets and goes 100% renewable. I'm wrapping up for today, but tune in again for more climate change news tomorrow. The Australian government currently has no plans to reduce emissions beyond 2020, and now its ministers have made it clear they have no plans to end the nation's love affair with coal - despite the IPCC's warnings. When considering the news about climate change, it is easy to think of it as a vague, abstract entity - but the reality is that this is something that is already affected people's lives. Scientists are increasingly confident attributing the likelihood and intensity of particular events - hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves - to the changing global climate. This year we have already seen climate change's fingerprints on events from Europe's\u00a0summer heatwave to Cape Town's drought. In this piece from our Middle East correspondent Bel Trew, she looks at\u00a0how vanishing water resources could fuel the next war in the Middle East and\u00a0North Africa: This morning a\u00a0Dutch appeals court upheld a historic ruling that ordered the government to slash the country's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25 per cent by 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels.\u00a0The decision means the government will have to accelerate decarbonisation.\u00a0 The order to increase emissions cuts is particularly pertinent a day after the IPCC report concluded global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are far from sufficient. The original June 2015 ruling came from environmental group Urgenda on behalf of 900 Dutch citizens, and has been followed by several similar cases in countries across the world. Judge  Tan de Sonnaville  said: Climate change is a grave danger. Any postponement of emissions reductions exacerbates the risks of climate change. The Dutch Government cannot hide behind other countries emissions. It has an independent duty to reduce emissions from its own territory. Tessa Khan , co-director of the Climate Litigation Network said: \r\nToday\u2019s judgment is a resounding vindication of all our demands that governments act decisively on climate change. \u00a0As yesterday\u2019s IPCC report confirmed, time is not on our side and our actions in the next few years will determine our future. The Appeal Court made it clear that if governments fail to urgently reduce emissions, they are knowingly putting their citizens in harm\u2019s way.\u00a0 This judgment puts governments all over the world on notice. Ordinary people in Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway and the US are already turning to the courts to protect their human rights in the face of devastating climate change. Governments have no more excuses for inaction after today; they must ramp up their ambition without delay or face the consequences.

But scientists say that's only a sliver of climate's overall toll \u2014 even more people die from other extreme weather amplified by global warming such as storms, flooding and drought \u2014 and the heat death numbers will grow exponentially with rising temperatures.  Dozens of researchers who looked at heat deaths in 732 cities around the globe from 1991 to 2018 calculated that 37% were caused by higher temperatures from human-caused warming, according to a study Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.  That amounts to about 9,700 people a year from just those cities, but it is much more worldwide, the study's lead author said. \u201cThese are deaths related to heat that actually can be prevented. It is something we directly cause,\u201d said Ana Vicedo-Cabrera, an epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventative Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland. The highest percentages of heat deaths caused by climate change were in cities in South America. Vicedo-Cabrera pointed to southern  Europe  and southern  Asia  as other hot spots for climate change-related heat deaths.  Sao Paulo  Brazil, has the most climate-related heat deaths, averaging 239 a year, researchers found. About 35% of heat deaths in the  United States  can be blamed on climate change, the study found. That\u2019s a total of more than 1,100 deaths a year in about 200 U.S. cities, topped by 141 in New York. Honolulu had the highest portion of heat deaths attributable to climate change, 82%. Scientists  used decades of mortality data in the 732 cities to plot curves detailing how each city\u2019s death rate changes with temperature and how the heat-death curves vary from city to city. Some cities adapt to heat better than others because of air conditioning, cultural factors and environmental conditions, Vicedo-Cabrera said. Then researchers took observed temperatures and compared them with 10 computer models simulating a world without climate change. The difference is warming humans caused. By applying that scientifically accepted technique to the individualized heat-death curves for the 732 cities, the scientists calculated extra heat deaths from climate change. \u201cPeople continue to ask for proof that climate change is already affecting our health. This attribution study directly answers that question using state-of-the-science epidemiological methods, and the amount of data the authors have amassed for analysis is impressive,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin. Patz, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said it was one of the first to detail climate change-related heat deaths now, rather than in the future. ___ Read stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/climate. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

They said that confidence human activities were raising the heat at the Earth's surface had reached a \u201cfive-sigma\u201d level. This statistical measure meaning there is only a one-in-a-million chance that the signal would appear if there was no warming. Such a \u201cgold standard\u201d was applied in 2012, for instance, to confirm the discovery of the  Higgs boson  subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Benjamin Santer, lead author of the study at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said he hoped the findings would win over sceptics and spur action. \u201cThe narrative out there that scientists don't know the cause of climate change is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do.\u201d Mainstream scientists say the burning of  fossil fuels  is causing more floods, droughts, heat waves and rising sea levels. Donald Trump  has often cast doubt on global warming and plans to pull out of the 197-nation  Paris climate agreement  which seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energies such as wind and solar power. Sixty-two per cent of Americans polled in 2018 believed that climate change has a human cause, up from 47 per cent in 2013, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. The findings, by researchers in the US, Canada and Scotland, said evidence for global warming reached the five sigma level by 2005 in two of three sets of satellite data widely used by researchers, and in 2016 in the third. Professor John Christy, of the University of Alabama in Huntsville which runs the third set of data, said there were still many gaps in understanding climate change. His data show a slower pace of warming than the other two sets. \u201cYou may see a certain fingerprint that indicates human influence, but that the actual intensity of the influence is minor (as our satellite data indicate),\u201d he said.  Separately in 2013, the  United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded that it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d, or at least 95 per cent probable, that human activities have been the main cause of climate change since the 1950s. Peter Stott of the British Met Office, who was among the scientists drawing that conclusion and was not involved in Monday's study, said he would favour raising the probability one notch to \u201cvirtually certain\u201d, or 99-100 per cent. \u201cThe alternative explanation of natural factors dominating has got even less likely,\u201d he said.  The last four years have been the hottest since records began in the 19th century. The IPCC will next publish a formal assessment of the probabilities in 2021. \u201cI would be reluctant to raise to 99-100 per cent, but there is no doubt there is more evidence of change in the global signals over a wider suite of ocean indices and atmospheric indices,\u201d said Professor Nathan Bindoff, a climate scientist at the University of Tasmania.

Mr Pence touted America\u2019s clean air and clean water while refusing to address the fact that climate change is a driving factor behind extreme events such as wildfires and hurricanes.\u00a0 The vice president claimed that rejoining the Paris Climate Accord would \u201ccrush\u201d the US economy and jobs, while Senator Harris said that she and Mr  Biden  were committed to rejoining the global commitment on reducing emissions to combat the climate crisis.

Warming in the 20th century, seen over 98 per cent of the world, is in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to previous warm and cool periods such as the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d when frost fairs were famously held on a frozen Thames, according to the findings in published in the journal  Nature . These occurred on a regional basis and others were seen in different parts of the world.  Researchers examined climate changes over the past 2,000 years which were thought to have been global in nature, such as the medieval warm period from 800 to 1200 AD and the Little Ice Age between 1300 and 1850. It found that warmer and cooler periods before the  Industrial Revolution , when human activity started to put out large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, were not \u201cglobally coherent\u201d. AFP\/Getty  Reuters EPA EPA Reuters EPA AP AP EPA AFP\/Getty During the Little Ice Age for example, the coldest temperatures were seen during the 15th century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the 17th century in north-western Europe and south-eastern North America, and during the mid-19th century over other regions. The researchers also said the previous periods are in line with natural variability of the climate. However, the rapid warming over the past 150 years is very different, with the warmest period of the past two millennia occurring during the 20th century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. \u201cThere\u2019s this globally coherent warm period that\u2019s very different than what we see in the past and that coherence cannot be explained by the natural variability of the climate,\u201d said one of the study\u2019s authors, Dr Nathan Steiger, of New York\u2019s Columbia University. \u201cIn the past the large patterns we do see we find those are consistent with natural variability but that\u2019s not the case with the current period.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen you go back in the past these are really regional phenomena, there\u2019s cold periods in Europe or the central Pacific, but they are not global, whereas the contemporary warm period really stands out. We find 98 per cent of the globe has this coherent warming during the contemporary warming period after the Industrial Revolution. That very much stands out and contrasts with the climate variability that has happened before in the past 2,000 years.\u201d Earlier this year a YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Poll found that 13 per cent of Americans agreed with the statement that human activity is \u201cnot responsible at all\u201d for  climate change .  Professor Mark Maslin, from University College London, (UCL) who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cOver the last 2,000 years the only time the global climate has change synchronically has been in the last 150 years when over 98 per cent of the surface of the planet has warmed. \u201cThis paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle. This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.\u201d His colleague, Professor Simon Lewis from UCL, said the study reinforced \u201cthe abundant evidence that human actions are driving rapid changes to the climate of our home planet\u201d. He added: \u201cWith new robust analyses and new and painstakingly collated data, the last few decades are again shown to stand out: it is warming everywhere. As I sit in a sweltering heatwave in London, the big question remains: are people going to force governments and businesses to take swift action to drive down greenhouse gas emissions to zero to stabilise the climate?\u201d Additional reporting by Press Association  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A study found there is the potential for an extra 900 million hectares (2.2 billion acres) of tree cover in areas that would naturally support woodland and forests. As they grow and mature, the trees could absorb and store 205 billion tonnes of  carbon , the analysis published in the journal  Science  suggests. If that mostly came from the atmosphere, it could tackle around two thirds of the 300 billion extra tonnes of carbon which is in the atmosphere because of human activity since the industrial revolution. In their study, the Swiss scientists from the Crowther Lab say it \u201chighlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date\u201d. AFP\/Getty Alan Schaller Nasa\/Getty Ross Wills AP Reuters AFP\/Getty Art Wolfe However, other experts claimed the study over-estimated how much carbon such forest restoration could take out of the atmosphere, and that the focus should instead be on eliminating emissions from fossil fuels. Professor Tom Crowther, senior author of the study, said: \u201cWe all knew restoring forests could play a part in tackling climate change, but we had no scientific understanding of what impact this could make. \u201cOur study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today and it provides hard evidence to justify investment. \u201cHowever, it will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential. \u201cIt is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies in order to avoid dangerous climate change.\u201d In the UK, an estimated 4.6 million hectares of tree cover could be created, much of it on grazing land which could continue to support livestock while providing carbon storage, the researchers say. The analysis used almost 80,000 high resolution satellite images of protected areas to assess natural levels of tree cover in areas ranging from Arctic tundra to savanna, open woods and dense forests. The Crowther Lab found that forests could be regrown on 1.7 to 1.8 billion hectares of land in areas with low human activity that are not currently used as urban or agricultural land, adding 900 million hectares of tree cover. The study led by Dr Jean-Francois Bastin also suggests that there is further potential to regrow trees in croplands and urban areas. The researchers estimate 700 million hectares of tree cover could be added through city trees and \u201cagroforestry\u201d \u2013 for example planting lines of apple trees through crops in the UK. Commenting on the study, Professor Simon Lewis, from  University College London , said the estimate that the extra forests could store 200 billion tonnes of carbon was \u201ctoo high\u201d. He added: \u201cNew forests can play a role in mopping up some residual carbon emissions, but the only way to stabilise the climate is for greenhouse gas emissions to reach net zero, which means dramatic cuts in emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation.\u201d PA contributed to this report.

Presented at a  major climate conference in Poland , a new report has compared the amount of money going into tackling  global warming  to the quantity of CO2 pollution each country emits. The EU, including the UK, and the US are home to most of the planet's wealthiest people, receiving more than half of the global income. At the same time, the poorest half of the world receives less than one tenth of the global total income and generates virtually no emissions. This disparity means the top countries are pumping out several tonnes more CO2 per capita than could be considered their \u201cfair share\u201d under existing climate targets. Without substantial support from wealthy countries, poorer nations will fall far short of ambitions to cut fossil fuels and the world will not be able to limit warming to the 1.5C increase scientists think is necessary. This independent review was backed by social movements, NGOs, trade unions, faith and other civil society groups from around the world. They also warned that \u201cglobal elites\u201d must not pass the burden onto poorer people within rich countries. French president Emmanuel Macron has  recently come under fire  for pushing through a fuel tax in an effort to cut emissions that critics said would place too much financial stress on ordinary French citizens. A key focus of the  COP24  event in the Polish city of Katowice is meant to be ramping up climate finance, specifically the annual $100 billion goal from donor nations to lower-income countries. AFP\/Getty EPA Reuters AFP\/Getty PA PA PA AFP\/Getty EPA PA Reuters PA Reuters AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty PA EPA EPA EPA PA Reuters EPA AFP\/Getty EPA Reuters The World Bank  pledged on the opening day  to invest $200bn (\u00a3157bn) to aid in a green transition for developing nations, but campaigners think more investment needs to come from wealthy nations. Though many poorer countries, particularly island states like Fiji and the Marshall Islands, have been vocal in their commitment to tackling global warming, they lack the capacity to meet global climate targets without support.  \u201cToday\u2019s report says all high emitters, predominantly the US and the EU, will have to do more to close the emissions gap. But they must also assist poorer countries to meet their goals through finance and technology access,\u201d said Rachel Kennerley, international climate campaigner for  Friends of the Earth . \u201cThis could, for example, mean sharing patent-free renewable technology. Equity is not a moral luxury, it is a practical necessity in meeting the Paris goals, but climate discussions in Poland this week have so far sidestepped it.\u201d Due to the huge quantities of carbon emissions coming from the wealthiest nations, the report found that they \u201ccannot possibly meet their full fair shares through domestic action alone\u201d. International aid to ensure \u201cclimate equity\u201d will therefore be vital, particularly as poorer nations tend to be most at risk from climate change, including drought and rising sea levels. \u201cUnless there is a fair deal that accounts for the legacy of climate change caused by industrialised developed countries, we will never have a sustainable global strategy,\u201d said Brandon Wu, ActionAid USA\u2019s director of policy and campaigns. \u201cWe have to get some trust back into the process, and that starts with rich countries making much stronger commitments to fix the climate crisis that they, and their wealthiest elites, are largely responsible for creating.\u201d The UK government has  come under fire  for using foreign aid money to support fossil fuel developments overseas, including China\u2019s fracking industry. Critics pointed out that it would be more beneficial to support the renewable energy industry and a green transition in other parts of the world.

The head of the EPA team is Patrice Simms, an environmental attorney at Earthjustice, which has filed more than 100 lawsuits against Donald Trump's administration.\u00a0 The Trump administration rolled back Obama-era fuel economy standards and stripped California of the ability to set zero-emission vehicle rules. Both actions remain subject to appeal. Meanwhile,  Greta Thunberg has launched a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump  for failure to concede the presidential election to Mr Biden. On Twitter, the teenage climate activist attacked Mr Trump for \u201cdenying democracy itself\u201d.\u00a0 Follow The Independent\u2019s latest updates below Hello, and welcome to  The Independent \u2019s rolling coverage of the climate crisis.\u00a0 Joe Biden has released the names of his transition teams, including those overseeing transfer of power at federal environmental and energy agencies - despite the Trump administration refusing to play ball.\u00a0 The Trump administration conducted 80 environmental rules and regulations rollbacks in the past four years, such as leaving the Paris Agreement earlier the month, with another 20 rollbacks still underway. People on Mr Biden\u2019s new teams have publicly condemned these actions, and come from organisations which have launched lawsuits over them, suggesting the 46th president considers how the US handles the climate crisis one of his top priorities. The Independent \u2019s  Louise Boyle  has all the details: The White House has instructed senior department officials to rebuff overtures from the Biden team to get the transition process underway while Mr Trump refuses to concede Greta Thunberg has launched a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump for failure to concede the presidential election to Joe Biden. The teenage climate activist took to Twitter to criticise Mr Trump for \u201cdenying democracy itself\u201d.\u00a0 The 10 executive actions president-elect Joe Biden has said he will take on his first day as president to combat the climate crisis and reduce emissions are: While the the Philippines endured a second typhoon in two weeks, the country\u2019s president, Rodrigo Duterte, called for developed nations to cut their carbon emissions in a bid to combat the effects of climate change. \u201cWe must amplify our voices to demand climate justice from those most responsible for this existential challenge we face today. Developed countries must lead in deep and drastic cuts in carbon emissions. They must act now, or it would be too late. Or if I may add, it is too late,\u201d Mr Duterte said. \u201cThis is their moral responsibility from which there should be no escape. Otherwise, it would be great injustice \u2013 a double blow to those who bear the brunt of the adverse consequences of their past actions and present inactions,\u201d he added. The current Typhoon Ulysses has yet to exit the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR).\u00a0 Just over two weeks ago, the Philippines was left devastated following another disaster, Typhoon Goni, which caused billions of pesos worth of damage to buildings and agriculture.\u00a0 The Dalai Lama has made an appeal to the world to do more to tackle the climate crisis in a new book published today. The Buddhist leader, who has more than 500 million followers across the world, praised Greta Thunberg and other young climate strikers for leading the charge in calling for tougher measures to tackle global heating. In the book, he also writes that \u201cBuddha would be green\u201d and he \u201ccertainly be connected to the campaign to protect the environment\u201d. Daisy Dunne ,  The Independent \u2019s climate correspondent, has more: The Buddhist leader praises Greta Thunberg and urges followers to act for the good of the planet in new book Actor Jane Fonda has said that by campaigning for action on climate change she hoped to show that \u201cold folks could be involved as well\u201d. Ms Fonda, 82, told  Harper's Bazaar  magazine she wanted to inspire others to take action on the climate crisis. The activist has regularly spoken out about environmental issues. Last year she was arrested during a climate change protest in Washington DC. Ms Fona said in the interview that people refuse to \u201cadmit the cause of the climate crisis which is fossil fuels\u201d. \u201cWhat makes me furious is so many people talk about windmills and turbines, but they don't talk about fossil fuels because it's controversial,\u201d she said. Fonda added: \u201cGrow some balls, the future is at stake.\u201d If you fancy some in-depth analysis,  Louise Boyle  has taken a look at what the climate crisis has to do with this year\u2019s most active hurricane season on record. \u201cThe researchers\u2019 results suggested \u2018a detectable increase of Atlantic intensification rates with a positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing\u2019. In other words, human-driven climate change.\u201d Read the full report here: 2020 is the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record after the 29th storm, Theta, on Monday Boris Johnson has said there is \u201cno time to waste\u201d on climate action as he called on world leaders to put forward ambitious commitments to tackle the crisis. The PM also promised to set out plans for driving UK action in comments marking a year until the UK hosts the United Nations Cop26 climate summit. The event was meant to be held this November but was delayed by the pandemic. The keenly-awaited \u201c10 point plan\u201d from Downing Street on a green industrial revolution is expected to outline action in areas such as cutting emissions from transport, electricity and buildings, and the use of hydrogen and other new technology. Mr Johnson has already highlighted plans to have every home in the country powered by offshore wind within 10 years as part of the plan. The UK has a legal target to cut greenhouse gases to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050, with huge cuts to emissions and any remaining pollution offset by measures such as planting trees, and has sought to position itself as a world leader on the issue. In December the UK is co-hosting a climate action summit for world leaders to bring forward more ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets ahead of next year's Cop26 meeting. International climate action has received a series of boosts in recent weeks, including China's pledge to become carbon neutral by 2060 and the US presidential election victory for Joe Biden who has made it a priority. Mr Johnson said: \u201cThere is no greater duty for any nation than protecting our people and our planet. \u201cThe pandemic has brought this into sharp focus, but climate change will remain the most enduring threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren - and the world we're fighting for - if we do not act. \u201cWe are one year out from hosting the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, bringing countries together to agree bold action to confront global warming. \u201cThere is no time to waste. That's why I'll be setting out my ten-point plan shortly which will not only create thousands of British jobs, but also invigorate our plans to achieve net zero by 2050. \u201cAnd that's why I'm calling on world leaders to put forward their own ambitious commitments to help eradicate our contributions to climate change, before we meet in Scotland next November.\u201d Countries are expected to submit more ambitious plans to cut emissions under the Paris Climate Agreement, as current proposals do not go far enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises and the worst impacts such as drought, sea level rises, extreme weather and wildlife loss. The UK also has to submit new plans, known as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d, as it is no longer covered by the European Union's efforts in the wake of Brexit, and officials say the plans are currently being reviewed. Greenpeace UK's senior climate campaigner, Paul Morozzo, said: \"Boris Johnson is right to call on world leaders to waste no time in setting out their commitments to cut carbon emissions, but the Prime Minister's actions will carry far more weight than his words. \"This is why it's so important that the UK Government lays out a world-leading plan to cut climate-wrecking emissions from every sector of our economy and society, including a phase-out date for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030. \"There's no vaccine against climate change. The real breakthrough has to come from political will, real action, and smart diplomacy, and next year's climate summit in Glasgow is our best chance to make it happen.\" PA Public service announcement: if you find yourself wondering what the climate crisis actually means, and how it could affect you -  The Independent \u2019s  Emma Snaith  has you covered.

Researchers from t he Energy and Climate Intelligence U nit , a non profit organisation that supports debate on climate change and energy issues, analysed 59 studies which looked at climate change and extreme weather. All had been published since the  Paris climate summit  two years ago. They concluded that 41 of the studies demonstrated climate change had made extreme weather events more intense and more long-lived. These included droughts in  Syria  to  Storm Desmond , which battered the UK in 2015. The harm inflicted by these events was estimated at around $8bn (\u00a35.9bn) in economic damage and resulted in at least 4,000 deaths. \u201cJust a few years ago it was hard to say more about any storm, drought or heatwave than it was \u2018consistent with what science predicts\u2019,\u201d said  the report\u2019s  author, Richard Black, a  director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. As climate science has advanced, scientists have become increasingly able to not just make future predictions of climate change\u2019s impact, but also look for its effects in current weather events, he added.  \u201cThis is a real world analysis of what is actually happening, rather than a projection of what might happen in the future,\u201d he said. \"This report shows that increasingly, [scientists are] finding that specific events are made more likely or more damaging by climate change.\" The effects were most obvious for heatwaves, as the connection between increased general temperatures and increased temperatures during a hot spell are relatively straightforward. Storms and hurricanes are more complicated. Although such events are strongly linked to climate change, they are complex phenomena with many contributing factors, making the links more ambiguous. \u201cWe\u2019re now finding that for many kinds of extreme weather event, especially heatwaves and extreme rainfall, we can be quite confident about the effect of climate change,\u201d said Dr Friederike Otto, deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the report. \u201cThis ECIU report shows just how quickly knowledge is accumulating, and I think it\u2019s only going to accelerate.\u201d Mr Black added: \u201cTwo years\u2019 worth of studies shows that climate change is affecting heatwaves, droughts and rainfall right now.\"  Reuters Reuters AP Photo\/LM Otero Reuters\/Nick Oxford Reuters Reuters\/Nick Oxford EPA AP Reuters EPA Rosenberg Police Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters EPA EPA AP EPA The new report comes shortly before another climate summit in Paris, the One Planet Summit, which is set to focus on the economics of climate change. Soenke   Kreft , leader of Munich Climate Insurance Initiative at the United Nations University, who was not involved in the report, said u nderstanding the links between natural disasters and climate change was important, as it can play a role in convincing policymakers and citizens of the threat posed by climate change and encouraging them to take action. \u201cAttribution science is an important field of research that has the potential to transform public narratives into more specific prevention measures of risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also helps to underscore the international responsibilities in supporting the protection of communities by prevention measures and insurance related mechanisms, and providing swift assistance in post disaster situations.\" Mr Black added: \u201cThe science shows that the further and faster climate change progresses the larger this effect is likely to be, therefore the best way to restrain this is to curb global emissions.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Results from the first five years of the government-funded National Plant Monitoring Scheme, using data from 15,000 surveys by volunteer citizen scientists, already shows the impact of a warming world on the  UK \u2019s plants. The data reveals that plants such as wild orchids are expanding their range northwards, experts said. The National Plant Monitoring Scheme looks at 30 different habitats, from woodland and hedgerows to blanket bogs and streams, with around 30 wildflowers to search for in each type of place. Data is collected by volunteers, coordinated by wildlife charity Plantlife and analysed by botanists from a range of organisations led by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). Southern marsh-orchids, a tall plant found in damp grasslands, was once restricted to the southern half of the UK but records have come in from as far north as Newcastle upon Tyne. Bee orchids were not previously found in  Scotland , but volunteers have discovered the plants, whose flowers resemble a bee\u2019s backside, at several sites around Glasgow and Edinburgh. Other specialist plants are moving outside their usual range, including mossy stonecrop, a succulent once only found in the New Forest and East Anglia, which is spreading to sandy habitats in Scotland. Early meadow-grass was formerly only found on the Lizard Peninsula in the extreme South West of England but has now been recorded in Fishguard, southwest Wales, as well as Rosslare in Ireland, and central London. There are also concerns about the threat and extinction risk to plants which have no further to go, for example Arctic and alpine species which cannot go further up the mountains, such as Highland saxifrage. And the increased risk of drought due to climate change puts many smaller, short-lived species at risk, with fairy flax, yellow-wort, soft brome and common mouse-ear suffering from heat and lack of water in 2018\u2019s drought. But the results from the monitoring scheme also show a rise in species able to cope with drought. These include salad burnet, a dark crimson flower found in old hay meadows, which has a longer root so it can reach down to moist soil, and wild thyme, which managed water loss with its tiny leaves. The analysis also reveals the impact of nitrogen pollution, with nitrogen-hungry stinging nettles the most frequently recorded native species in woodlands.  Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Dr Trevor Dines, Plantlife\u2019s botanical specialist, said experts had previously thought that it would \u201ctake an awful lot\u201d for plants to start moving northwards because their dispersal is very slow. \u201cTo actually start seeing that now, coming through so strongly, is a real wake-up call,\u201d he said. \u201cIt proves to us that climate change is having a real impact.\u201d And he said: \u201cOur concern is that we live in such a fragmented landscape, there aren\u2019t the places for these plants to go.\u201d Growing chances of drought, particularly in the crucial spring months of April, May and June, is even more of a risk than general warmer conditions, he warned. \u201cAny climate change that involves drought scenarios is going to affect plant populations much more quickly.\u201d He said tackling climate change is about making the landscape as permeable as possible so things can move around, by creating a habitat where flowers can bloom and setting as much seed as possible through grazing animals and hay cutting at the right time of year. Road verges, which are corridors through the landscape, should not be subject to repeated mowing while moving livestock, machinery and distributing wildflower-rich hay can all move seed around the landscape, he said. And while rewilding can play a part on a small scale, Dr Dines said agri-environment schemes could be used to get habitat management in place to suit wildflowers on as wide a scale as possible.

La Nina lowers temperatures.  The WMO said there is a 35 per cent chance of an El Nino and only a 5 per cent chance of a La Nina weather pattern developing this year. But despite the likely absence of an El Nino, the WMO warned there will still be above-average sea surface temperatures in many parts of the world, which will lead to higher than normal land temperatures, particularly in the tropics.  Mr Taalas said: \u201cEven ENSO neutral months are warmer than in the past, as air and sea surface temperatures and ocean heat have increased due to climate change. \u201cWith more than 90 per cent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases going into the ocean, ocean heat content is at record levels. \u201cThus, 2016 was the warmest year on record as a result of a combination of a strong El Nino and human-induced global warming. 2019 was the second-warmest year on record, even though there was no strong El Nino.\u201d He added: \u201cWe just had the warmest January on record. The signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as that from a major natural force of nature.\u201d Already this year, January has broken records to become the warmest ever recorded. Norway  saw its hottest January day  since records began, with a reading of 19C \u2013 more than 25C above the monthly average \u2013 measured in the village of Sunndalsora, which is around 250 miles north of Oslo. Weather stations in central and southern Finland also recorded their warmest January in the period since at least 1961, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change service.  This week the Finnish Meteorological Institute  revealed  the capital, Helsinki, experienced the first ever January - February period on record without any measurable snow.

Ms Stratton said that the science was clear that faster action is needed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in order to stop global temperature increases by 2030. Her comments are likely to alarm backbench Conservative MPs who fear that voters are being asked to shoulder too great a financial burden to give the UK a world-leading role in the fight against climate change. The UK was the first major industrialised country in the world to sign the 2050 target into law in 2019, and is aiming to persuade other nations to follow suit at the  COP26  summit which Mr Johnson is chairing in November. But Ms Stratton stressed that the plan envisaged immediate action, with interim targets of 68 per cent reductions by 2030 and 78 per cent by 2035 to put the UK on a \u201cglide path\u201d to net zero. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s  World This Weekend , Ms Stratton said that the technology needed to reduce emissions was becoming cheaper all the time, making the  net zero  target no more expensive than the previous 80 per cent target, at about 1 per cent of GDP.

We have to bring countries to COP26 in November in Glasgow with real substantial plans.\u201d Ms Stratton, who speaks on COP26 on the prime minister\u2019s behalf, pointed to the government\u2019s 10-point plan for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d and to pledges from FTSE100 companies to go net-zero as signs of progress towards the 2050 goal. But she added: \u201cEvery bit of society is moving in tandem towards this net zero in 2050, but let\u2019s be honest that\u2019s too far away. \u201cNet zero is the glide path. What we have to be doing more quickly \u2013 the science is clear \u2013 [is] we have to be changing our carbon emissions output right now, so that we can stop temperature increase by 2030.\u201d Amid growing concerns that the UK is lagging behind in its drive to secure international agreement on ambitious targets, Ms Stratton acknowledged that progress had been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. But she said that plans will be unveiled when parliament returns in September for projects like the replacement of gas boilers with more climate-friendly alternatives over the coming decade. Ms Stratton admitted that ministers had to overcome distrust from voters in light of fast-changing advice on issues like diesel cars \u2013 which were promoted as environmentally friendly for many years before the harmful effects of their exhaust became known. \u201cMy granny says to me \u2018Why would we believe government when look what they encouraged us to buy and how quickly they changed their opinion?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut that only underscores the reason why this has to be done properly so we take people with us because it would be so damaging to have another version of that.\u201d She said that the government had a \u201cbalancing act\u201d between moving swiftly enough to respond to the scale of the challenge and taking enough time to ensure that new technology like electric cars works as it should. \u201cThis is a long-term journey we are all on,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a journey to 2050. \u201cThis is not going to happen overnight. This is going to be a conversation we have with the British people about what is fair, protecting vulnerable families from some of the more difficult decisions they will have to make.\u201d Ms Stratton declined to discuss reports that chancellor Rishi Sunak is holding out against green taxes to pay for action on climate change. \u201cWhat worries me and what worries members of the government is the extreme climate change and weather events that we are seeing in this country now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe climate has warmed by 1.2 degrees. We are trying to limit that increase to 1.5. Everyone can see that the margin we have right now is not big. We are headed for 3. If we think about the weather we\u2019re seeing right now at 1.2, what the weather be like at 3 doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Under pressure from shareholders and regulators, companies are increasingly disclosing the specific financial effects they could face as the planet warms, such as  extreme weather  that could disrupt their supply chains or stricter climate regulations that could hurt the value of coal, oil and gas investments. Early estimates suggest that trillions of pounds may ultimately be at stake. Even so, analysts warn that many companies are still lagging in accounting for all of the plausible financial risks from global warming. \u201cThe numbers that we\u2019re seeing are already huge, but it\u2019s clear that this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Bruno Sarda, the North America president for Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an international non-profit that wrote the new report and works with companies around the world to publicly disclose the risks and opportunities that climate change could create for their businesses. Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters PA AFP\/Getty  Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty AFP\/Getty In 2018, more than 7,000 companies submitted such reports to CDP and, for the first time, CDP explicitly asked firms to try to calculate how a warming planet might affect them financially. After analysing submissions from 215 of the world\u2019s 500 biggest corporations, CDP found that these companies potentially faced roughly $1 trillion (\u00a3790 million) in  costs related to climate change  in the decades ahead unless they took proactive steps to prepare. By the companies\u2019 own estimates, a majority of those financial risks could start to materialise in the next five years or so. The disclosures show how business leaders expect climate change, and the policy responses to it, to ripple through every corner of the global economy. Many firms are bracing for direct impacts. Hitachi Ltd, a Japanese manufacturer, said that increased rainfall and  flooding in South East Asia  had the potential to knock out suppliers and that it was taking defensive measures as a result. Banco Santander Brasil, a large Brazilian bank, said increasingly severe droughts in the region might hurt the ability of borrowers to repay loans. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, Inc, noted that rising temperatures could increase the cost of cooling its energy-hungry data centres. Others are keeping a close eye on the potential public reaction to climate change. Total, a French energy company, is grappling with the possibility that ambitious efforts by nations to limit global warming and restrict fossil fuel use could render  some oil and gas reserves \u201cunburnable\u201d . BASF, a German chemical company, said it has a \u201csignificant corporate carbon footprint\u201d that could scare off environmentally conscious shareholders unless it takes steps to act on climate change. In all, the world\u2019s largest companies estimated that at least $250bn (\u00a3198bn) of assets may need to be written off or retired early as the planet heats up. Those assets include buildings in high-risk flood zones, or power plants that may have to shut down in response to tighter pollution rules. The disclosures offer only a partial glimpse at the potential price tag of climate change. Only a fraction of companies worldwide currently report their climate risks, and many large firms, including  energy giants Exxon Mobil  and Chevron, did not submit a disclosure to CDP last year. The companies that do disclose often struggle to tease out precisely how rising temperatures might hurt or help them financially. For instance, Sarda said, it\u2019s relatively straightforward for businesses to calculate the potential costs from an increase in taxes designed to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Indeed, this is one of the most common climate-related risks that companies now disclose. But it\u2019s trickier to take scientific reports about rising temperatures and weather extremes and say what those broad trends might mean for specific companies in specific locations. Previous studies, based on computer climate modelling, have estimated that the risks of global warming, if left unmanaged, could cost the world\u2019s financial sector between $1.7 trillion (\u00a31.34 trillion) to $24.2 trillion (\u00a319.1 trillion) in net present value terms. A recent analysis published in the journal  Nature Climate Change  warned that companies are reporting on these risks only \u201csporadically and inconsistently\u201d and often take a narrow view of the dangers that may lie ahead. On the flip side, the CDP report found, many companies also see money-making  potential in climate change . Some 225 of the world\u2019s largest corporations highlighted roughly $2.1 trillion (\u00a31.66 trillion) of possible opportunities in a warming world, with the majority expected to materialise within the next five years. Eli Lilly, a drug-maker in the United States, cited research suggesting that rising temperatures could  drive the spread  of infectious diseases \u2013 a problem the company was well-positioned to help address. \u201cThis may then increase demand for certain medicines we produce,\u201d the firm said. At the same time, the company also warned that climate change could hurt financially if flooding and fiercer storms disrupted its manufacturing facilities in places like Puerto Rico, as happened after Hurricane Maria in 2017. And any shift towards clean energy sources offers a chance to profit. ING Group, a Dutch financial services firm, estimated that the shift to a low-carbon economy could require $30 trillion (\u00a323.7 trillion) in new investments towards clean energy and energy efficiency worldwide. As a result, ING aims to double its \u201c climate finance  portfolio\u201d by 2022, the company said in its disclosure. The report comes as financial regulators have expressed growing concern that markets are not yet fully pricing in the potential financial consequences of climate change. Last month, the European Central Bank warned that a spate of severe weather that caused major losses for insurers, or an unexpectedly rapid shift by investors away from fossil fuels could hit the balance sheets of unprepared banks and potentially destabilise the financial system. \u201cClimate change-related risks have the potential to become systemic for the euro area,\u201d the bank said, \u201cin particular if markets are not pricing the risks correctly.\u201d In 2015, the Financial Stability Board \u2013 an influential panel made up of finance ministers, central bankers and regulators from the world\u2019s largest economies \u2013 established a task force that aimed to coax banks and other businesses to be more transparent about their climate risks. But progress has been slow. The CDP report found that companies headquartered in the European Union are much more likely to detail the potential financial effects of global warming, in part because local regulations often require them to do so. By contrast, companies in the United States, China, Brazil and Mexico were far less likely to report significant financial risks.

The UN food agency has  warned  that thousands of families in southern Madagascar are on the edge of starvation as the country faces its worst drought in four decades. Families have been sustaining themselves on raw red cactus fruits, wild leaves, and locusts for several months.  World Food Programme ( WFP ) Executive Director David Beasley\u00a0explained\u00a0that he had met women and children who had \u201cwalked for hours\u201d to get to the food distribution points. \u201cThese were the ones who were healthy enough to make it\u201d, he added. More than 1.14 million people are food insecure as severe droughts in Madagascar have led to an almost total disappearance of food sources and pushed communities to the brink of starvation.  \u201cThis is not because of war or conflict, this is because of climate change,\u201d Mr Beasley said.  WFP warned that an estimated 14,000 people are already in catastrophic conditions, which will double by October. While this area of the world has contributed nothing to climate change, they are \u201cpaying the highest price\u201d, he added. Last month, analysis by Geneva-based aid agency Care International pointed out how wealthy countries are \u2018\u2019falling short\u2019\u2019 on financial goals to mitigate climate crisis in developing countries. The analysis showed that rich countries\u2019 latest climate finance plans were devoid of exact details and did not meet the $100bn- a-year target (\u00a370bn) for 2020. In 2009, rich countries agreed to provide public and private money to help developing nations expand their clean energy options and adapt to the consequences of rising temperatures - which countries like southern Madagascar desperately need. Meanwhile, WFP said it needs $78.6 million to provide life-saving food for the next lean season. In the long term, the country needs irrigation systems, roads, and much more to stem the hunger crisis - infrastructure which it doesn\u2019t have. The remote location of many communities, coupled with poor roads, has prevented aid workers from delivering aid to the intended recipients. WFP said that malnutrition levels in children under five in Madagascar have almost doubled over the last four months, to an alarming 16.5 per cent. And the district of Ambovombe is among the worst-hit areas where 27 per cent face a life-threatening situation. \u201cThis is enough to bring even the most hardened humanitarian to tears\u201d, said Mr Beasley. Last week the WFP chief met with Prime Minister Christian Ntsay and senior officials to identify immediate and long-term solutions to this crisis.

Despite pledges to work to mitigate and deal with climate change, current plans still lead to a 3-degree Celsius rise in temperatures by the end of the decade, a major new report warns. If that happens, it will not only break through the 2-degrees target set in the Paris agreement, but also lead to deadly changes in the climate across the world. In its latest \"Emissions Gap\" report issued ahead of an important climate conference in Germany next week, the program takes aim at coal-fired electricity plants being built in developing economies and says investment in renewable energies will pay for itself \u2014 and even make money \u2014 over the long term.  Tuesday's report comes as U.N. officials are making a renewed push to maintain momentum generated by the Paris climate accord of 2015. It aims to cap global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 compared to average world temperatures at the start of the industrial era. But that agreement has come under threat after Donald Trump suggested he might opt to pull out of it. The new report doesn't include any impact from the US withdrawing, and if it did then the picture would become \"even bleaker\", the UN said. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \"The Paris agreement boosted climate action, but momentum is clearly faltering,\" said Edgar Gutierrez-Espeleta, Costa Rica's environment minister who heads the 2017 UN Environment Assembly. \"We face a stark choice: up our ambition, or suffer the consequences.\"  The report does find some causes for hope. It notes that there is \"rapidly expanding mitigation action\" being done by governments, and finds that carbon dioxide emissions seem to have stopped rising since 2014. But it noted that other dangerous greenhouses gases like methane continue to rise. The report also highlights the positive effects of investment in solar and wind energy and efficient appliances and cars, and efforts to preserve forests. But it warns that both private companies and governments could reverse those gains by failing to do enough to counteract current levels of emissions.

One of Theresa May\u2019s first acts as Prime Minister was to move responsibility for climate change to a new Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. Only on Monday, Government advisers had warned of the  need to take urgent action  to prepare the UK for floods, droughts, heatwaves and food shortages caused by climate change. The news came after the appointment of Andrea Leadsom \u2013 who revealed her first question to officials when she became Energy Minister last year was \u201c Is climate change real?  \u2013 was appointed as the new Environment Secretary. And, after former Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd announced in November that Britain was going to \u201cclose coal\u201d by 2025, Ms Leadsom later asked the  coal industry to help define what this actually meant .  Former Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted: \u201cDECC abolition just plain stupid. Climate not even mentioned in new deptartment title. Matters because departments shape priorities, shape outcomes.\u201d Greenpeace said it was concerned that the new Government did not view climate change as a serious threat.. John Sauven, the campaign group's executive director, said: \u201cThe voting record and affiliation with climate sceptics of key cabinet appointees are deeply worrying. \"They show a lack of understanding posed by climate change to the UK and the world. If we are to continue to have a key global role in environmental action, we need urgent reassurance from the new government that the hard won progress on climate and renewables targets, air pollution and the protection of wildlife will not be sidelined or abandoned in the Brexit negotiations.\u201d Green Party MP Caroline Lucas described the decision as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. \u201cClimate change is the biggest challenge we face, and it must not be an afterthought for the Government,\u201d she said. \u201cDealing with climate change requires a dedicated Minister at the Cabinet table. To throw it into the basement of another Whitehall department, looks like a serious backwards step.\u201d She said she would work with any Minister \u201cwilling to take climate change seriously\u201d, but added she would seek to hold Government to account for \u201cany backpeddling on our climate change commitments\u201d. Getty Images PA Reuters Rex PA PA PA Getty PA Getty Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Reuters Getty Images Reuters Reuters EPA PA EPA Getty  PA AP PA PA GETTY Getty Images Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, pointed out that a major report into the effects of climate change on Britain had made clear that it was already happening. \u201cThis is shocking news. Less than a day into the job and it appears that the new Prime Minister has already downgraded action to tackle climate change, one of the biggest threats we face,\u201d he said. \u201cThis week the Government\u2019s own advisors warned of ever growing risks to our businesses, homes and food if we don\u2019t do more to cut fossil fuel pollution.  \u201cIf Theresa May supports strong action on climate change, as she\u2019s previously said, it\u2019s essential that this is made a top priority for the new business and energy department and across government.\u201d And Stephen Devlin, an environmental economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), said the department\u2019s abolition was \u201c a terrible move by our new Prime Minister \u201d. He said it appeared to signal \u201ca troubling de-prioritisation of climate change by this government\u201d. \u201cTackling climate change is an era-defining challenge that must direct and determine what industries we develop, what transport infrastructure we construct, how we manage our land and what our diets look like. It requires a central co-ordinated strategy; if we leave it to the afterthoughts of other departments we will fail,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reshuffle risks dropping climate change from the policy agenda altogether \u2013 a staggering act of negligence for which we will all pay the price.\u201d He called on Ms May to reaffirm the Government\u2019s commitment to the 2008 Climate Change Act, which he described as a \u201cworld-leading piece of legislation\u201d. This commits the UK to an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is \u201cone of few remaining silver linings in UK environmental policy\u201d, Mr Devlin said.  A letter by  DECC\u2019s permanent secretary, Alex Chisholm, to staff in his department,  which was leaked to Civil Service World , confirmed that its responsibilities were being transferred to the new  Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, under its new Secretary, Greg Clark. \"We can make sure we have the 21st century infrastructure we need. Business will have a strong champion in government,\" he wrote.  \"Energy and climate change will continue in a single department ensuring efficient paths to carbon reduction.\u201d A spokesman for DECC told The Independent: \"Nothing is changing. The commitment [to dealing with climate change] is still there.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Gene editing - making changes in the DNA sequence of living things, essentially tailoring characteristics - has developed rapidly in the past decade. On Wednesday, American biochemist Jennifer A Doudna and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier were awarded the Nobel Prize for the pioneering CRISPR gene editing method which can change the DNA of animals, plants and micro-organisms with exacting precision. A report published last month  by nonpartisan science and tech think-thank the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) looked at how gene editing can tackle climate challenges, from optimising biofuels to improving the sustainability of fish and shrimp aquaculture and reducing methane emissions from rice paddies and  cows .\u00a0 ITIF\u2019s report suggested that gene editing could lead to a 50 per cent improvement in agricultural productivity by 2050.\u00a0 There are around 1.4 billion cattle on the planet, making up the second-largest source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) after  food waste . Cow farts, and more importantly cow belches, release methane, a powerful GHG. \u00a0In the first two decades after its release, methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to the  Environmental Defense Fund . Along with other grazing animals, cattle make up about 40 per cent of the annual global methane budget, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. Cows have become the unwitting target of a polarised climate debate. \u00a0After the Green New Deal proposed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey highlighted the impact of agricultural emissions in the climate crisis, a wave of hysteria ensued among Republicans and on conservative news outlets. \u00a0\u201cThey want to take away your hamburgers,\u201d Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump adviser, told CPAC,\u00a0 while Fox News host Jeanine Pirro appeared in a segment with a vivid depiction of a cow\u2019s fiery explosion destroying the earth.\u00a0 Cows get nutrients by chewing cud, partly-fermented plant material, that is regurgitated from the first of its four stomach chambers prior to digestion. The methane that cows produce is mainly caused by microbes which live in a cow\u2019s digestive tract rather than the cattle themselves, the ITIF report notes.\u00a0 Gene editing and selective breeding could provide a long-term solution for those methane emissions. A 2012 Australian study of more than 1,000 cattle from different herds found that among the quarter of a million different microbes in their digestive tracts, some 39 correlated with both productivity and methane generation.\u00a0 \u201cAs the individual genes responsible for the presence of these microbes are identified, it will become straightforward to use gene editing to knock out those most responsible for high methane production bacteria or increase the expression of others that favour low-methane species,\u201d the ITIF study says. The results suggest that gene editing could dramatically reduce emissions from livestock and researchers are now seeking to extend the technique into sheep as well as cattle. Such is the possibilities for tackling  climate change , ITIF calls on governments to increase research and development and \u201celiminate unscientific regulatory burdens on gene editing\u201d. Val Giddings, senior fellow at ITIF, who co-authored the report, said in a statement: \u201cWhile it is impossible to predict the extent to which gene-edited solutions will contribute to climate change mitigation, it is clear there is considerable potential. \u201cThe gene editing toolkit is so powerful, its applications so widespread, and its development so rapid that we simply cannot yet conceive all the ways in which it will be used in the coming decades.\" However the speed at which advances are being made has raised ethical questions. In 2018, there was outrage among the scientific community after a Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced that he had used gene editing to modify the DNA of twin girls before birth and make them resistant to HIV. He was subsequently \u00a0jailed for three years. Altering cows\u2019 diets can also reduce methane emissions. Research conducted in 2018 found that adding seaweed to their feed could reduce emissions from cattle gut microbes by as much as 99 per cent.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Donald Trump \u2019s reelection could have a lasting impact on the fight against the  climate crisis , scientists say. A second Trump term would end mid-way through the 2020s, a decade in which scientists say greenhouse gas emissions must be sharply reduced to limit more catastrophic consequences caused by global heating. However as soon as it was possible, the president announced that the US would withdraw from the  2015 Paris Climate Agreement , the international pact to limit global heating to well below 2C, with an increasingly ambitious target of 1.5C. The US officially abandons the agreement on 4 November, the day after the election. Climate scientists  are also worried that Trump\u2019s re-election would bolster the oil and gas industry, and lead to further rollbacks on climate and environmental protections. So what exactly has the president said about the climate crisis and what are his plan to tackle further global heating? The president has waxed and waned from outright climate change denial to misleading GOP talking points. During a visit with California public officials in September , as the state battled unprecedented  wildfires , Mr Trump blamed bad forest management while ignoring the climate crisis. \u201cWhen trees fall down after a short period of time, they become very dry \u2014 really like a matchstick. And they can explode. Also leaves. When you have dried leaves on the ground, it\u2019s just fuel for the fires,\u201d Mr Trump said. California\u2019s State Natural Resources Agency Secretary, Wade Crowfoot, urged the president to \u201crecognise the changing climate and what it means to our forests\". \u201cIf we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it\u2019s all about vegetation management, we\u2019re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,\u201d Mr Crowfoot added. Mr Trump responded: \u201cIt will start getting cooler, just you watch.\u201d The state official pushed back, saying that he wished the science agreed with the president.\u00a0 The president countered: \"I don\u2019t think science knows, actually.\u201d Over the years, the President has called it a \u201choax\u201d and told the\u00a0 Washington Post \u00a0that he is \"not a big believer in man-made climate change\".\u00a0 He has\u00a0 blamed China \u00a0(then later said it was a \"joke\") and pointed to snaps of freezing weather as evidence that global heating isn\u2019t happening. \"In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can\u2019t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? [sic] Please come back fast, we need you!\"  he\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in January 2019 .\u00a0 (A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appeared to respond with a tweet that read, \"winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening\" and a link to an explainer). Donald Trump's campaign site posted his  second-term MAGA agenda , \"Fighting for You!\u201d in August. The brief list of bullet points appear under headline themes similar to issues which Mr Trump campaigned on in 2016, like \u201cDrain The Swamp\u201d and \u201cEnd Illegal Immigration And Protect American Workers\u201d.\u00a0 There\u2019s no mention of climate change or the environment. \u201cOver the coming weeks, the President will be sharing additional details about his plans through policy-focused speeches on the campaign trail,\u201d the agenda notes. The Independent  sought comment from the Trump campaign\u2019s press office for updates on the president\u2019s plan to tackle climate change but had received no response at the time of publication. During questions on climate change at the last debate, Mr Trump said: \u201cYou know we\u2019re planting a billion trees,\u00a0a billion-tree project.\u201d This month, he signed an executive order making the US government part of a global tree planting initiative but did not commit to a number of trees. \u201cThe fossil fuel carbon is so much bigger than all the carbon in the trees. You can\u2019t do carbon neutral by planting trees ... it\u2019s sort of a band aid,' University of Chicago geophysical sciences professor David Archer previously told  The Hill . In his first year as president, Mr Trump withdrew from the Paris Accord, the global agreement involving almost every nation on earth to reduce the human-caused greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. If Mr Trump wins a second term, the US will officially exit the deal on the day after the election. He quashed the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan - which set the first-ever limits on power plants, the largest source of carbon pollution in the US.\u00a0 The president has rolled back nearly 100 environmental rules, according to a tally kept by the  New York Times.  The greatest number focused on air pollution and emissions.\u00a0 He has watered down vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, also established during the Obama-era, which had aimed to encourage auto-makers to ramp up electric vehicle production, and ended a waiver that allowed California and some other states to apply their own stricter standards. Mr Trump has cosied up to the fossil fuel industry  throughout his presidency  and supported its expansion, reversing President Obama\u2019s decisions to deny permits for pipelines like the Dakota Access site and Keystone XL. Some of the industry\u2019s most powerful figures have subsequent showered him in campaign donations,  E&E News  reported.

It also called for a new  UN  treaty committing nations to better interventions against the crisis. The report,  published on Tuesday by the Environment Investigation Agency  \u2013 an international NGO that investigates and campaigns against environmental crime and abuse \u2013 said the threat from  plastic pollution  is almost equivalent to  climate change . Citing previous studies, the report warned that the emissions of virgin plastic into oceans alone are expected to triple by 2040, threatening the ability of habitats across the planet to sustain life. However, it pointed to the lack of a significant legally-binding global treaty to address rampant plastic pollution. A recent United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report titled  Making Peace with Nature  identified three existential environmental threats \u2013 climate change,  biodiversity loss , and pollution \u2013 and discusses how they need to be addressed together to achieve sustainability. The EIA report argues that while two of these threats \u2013 biodiversity and climate change \u2013 have had dedicated multilateral environmental agreements for about three decades, \u201cno such instrument for plastic yet exists\u201d. The three environmental crises compete for public and policy attention, \u201cwith each crisis having its own band of proponents who insist their crisis is the one most in need of awareness, interest and financial support\u201d. But, the report argued, these do not exist in isolation.  It noted that these three crises are intricately linked, with shared causes and problem drivers, as well as a common root cause \u2013 \u201cthe overconsumption of finite resources\u201d. Despite the overlapping connection between plastic production, use, and related greenhouse gas emissions, the report argued that \u201cno mention of plastic was made\u201d in the final  Glasgow  Climate pact from November 2021 at the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Without serious efforts to curb this pollution, the report warned that by 2040, plastic waste could amount to about 700 million tonnes, and by 2050, the weight of plastic could \u201cfar exceed\u201d the weight of fish in every ocean on the planet. \u201cOur oceans truly are turning into a plastic soup,\u201d the report warned, adding that polluting plastic was not just found in the deepest parts of the seas but also on the highest mountain peaks, human organs, and on remote uninhabited islands. When plastic in the environment breaks down into ultra-small micro and nano plastics with the release and accumulation of toxic chemicals, they also act as potential vectors for disease and invasive species and contribute to global warming, it said. Plastics are about 80 per cent carbon and their manufacturing also involves the burning of large quantities of fossil fuels to provide for the high energy demands of industrial processes. During the recycling and disposal phases, about 12 per cent of all plastic waste ever created has been incinerated \u2013 a process that could release new toxic chemicals into the environment such as dioxins produced from burning Poly-Vinyl Chloride. Some of these toxic chemicals have serious health effects. They can compromise immunity and reproductive systems, cause cancers and impair cognitive functions, even in extremely low doses. Past estimates suggest that about 80 per cent of all plastic waste ever created is either in the open environment or ends up in a landfill where they continue to leak methane \u2013 a powerful greenhouse gas several times more potent than carbon dioxide. In 2015 alone, the report said, the total estimated lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from plastics, including from their manufacture and degradation, was 1.78 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. \u201cFor context, if the whole plastics lifecycle were a country, it would be the fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world,\u201d it noted. Plastic pollution, the report cautioned, also threatens the Earth\u2019s biodiversity with at least 914 species found to be directly impacted by either plastic ingestion or entanglement. \u201cThis includes all marine species, nearly half of all surveyed seabird and marine mammal species as well as 69 freshwater birds and 49 land birds from 53 families,\u201d the report noted, adding that lost and discarded fishing gear are responsible for over 83 per cent of entanglement cases. As the plastics on Earth break down, the microplastics released are taken up by plants and animals at the bottom of the food chain, including ocean plankton, which are responsible for producing most of the planet\u2019s oxygen. Recent studies have also shown that bacteria and other micro-communities living on plastic help spread antibiotic resistance genes globally. Since surface of discarded plastic offers a conducive environment for several microbial species to grow and thrive, the report warned, citing recent research, that some of these bacteria can trade genetic code for resisting antibiotic treatment through a process called Horizontal Gene Transfer across species, posing a greater public health threat. While global treaties with jurisdiction, holding countries and entities accountable, exist for climate change and biodiversity loss, the EIA report argued that in the case of plastic pollution, despite mounting evidence on its harms, no such agreement exists. With over 100 countries, including the UK, expected to favour a new agreement at the next  UN Environment  Assembly in February and March, the report highlighted the need for a comprehensive agreement with interventions envisioned for every stage of the plastic lifecycle, including production, product design, and waste management.

Future warming from greenhouse gases that have already been emitted is called \u201ccommitted warming\u201d. \u201cIt arises because when you emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it takes a very long time to fully realise the warming,\u201d said Andy Dessler, a co-author of the report. \u201cThe ocean has an enormous amount of heat capacity and it takes decades or centuries for it to warm up in response to those emissions.\u201d And as fossil fuels continue to be burnt, the level of future warming humans are committing the planet to is still continuing to rise. \u201cWe have few ways to avoid this committed warming,\u201d he said in  a video  summarising the findings of the report. Previous estimates for the Earth's committed warming suggested an additional 1.3C was on the way, but the new report suggests that number could be over 2C. In particular the paper looks at how cloud cover over Antarctic areas could change in future. Clouds reflect sunlight back into space, helping to keep the planet cool, but if cloud coverage drops, energy from the sun is readily absorbed by the Earth, warming it up. \u201cOne way to estimate committed warming is to assume that changes in the future will pretty much follow changes in the past. In particular we can estimate how clouds have changed in the past as the climate warms \u2013 a process known as the cloud feedback, and assume that future changes will be similar. This yields an estimate for committed warming of 1.4C [above pre-industrial levels],\u201d said Professor Dessler. This is similar to the previous estimates for committed warming. \u201cWhat this means is that we are committed to 1.4C of warming above pre-industrial, just due to emissions which have already taken place \u2013 future emissions will cause warming above this committed baseline.\u201d But he said: \u201cThe main conclusion of our paper is that assuming future changes in the climate system will follow past changes is a bad assumption.\u201d He said this is because historical data reveals that over the 20th century, the slowest area of warming has been in the Southern Ocean, around Antarctica.\u00a0 But this is an area of very high heat capacity \u2013 it takes a long time to warm it up, and  global warming  has not been going on long enough to have had a significant impact on weather patterns here. \u201cThe existence of cold present day sea-surface temperatures in these regions, while the overlying atmosphere is warming due to global warming, favours the buildup of low clouds over the region,\" he said. \"These clouds reflect sunlight back into space and tend to cool the planet.\u201d But when the Southern Ocean does eventually warm up, the likely result will be the clouds are more readily burnt off, allowing more sunlight through to be absorbed by the Earth, and giving us additional warming, Professor Dessler said. This has not happened during the 20th century, and is therefore not in the datasets which have previously been used to calculate likely future warming, and have potentially therefore underestimated possible global temperature rises. \u201cWhen we account for this process, we find that committed warming has a most-likely value of around 2.5C above pre-industrial ... this is just from emissions that have already occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously this exceeds the Paris agreement limits. While I would not categorise this as good news, it is not game over for the climate.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s important to realise this committed warming is a very slow process because it requires warming regions of the planet that are very slow to warm, therefore it could take centuries for the bulk of this committed warming to occur. \u201cOn the other hand if we continue to emit greenhouse gases at the rate we currently are, we will blow through the 1.5 and 2C limits possibly within a few decades.\u201d He added: \u201cThis means our work is consistent with the conclusion we need to reduce emissions as quickly as possible - if we do that, we will still break 2C, but it will be hundreds of years in the future.  \u201cIf we can get emissions to net zero soon, we can stay below 2C for a very long time, giving us more time to adapt.\" The research  is published in  Nature Climate Change .

The administration already is dealing with congressional refusal to enact the climate change proposals in President  Joe Biden 's Build Better Back plan. Now the justices, in arguments Monday, are taking up an appeal from 19 mostly Republican-led states and coal companies over the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The court took on the case even though there is no current  EPA  plan in place to deal with carbon output from power plants, a development that has alarmed environmental groups. They worry that the court could preemptively undermine whatever plan Biden's team develops to address power plant emissions. Biden has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade. A broad ruling by the court also could weaken regulatory efforts that extend well beyond the environment, including consumer protections, workplace safety and public health. Several conservative justices have criticized what they see as the unchecked power of federal agencies. Those concerns were evident in the court's orders throwing out two Biden administration policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Last summer, the court's 6-3 conservative majority ended a pause on evictions over unpaid rent. In January, the same six justices blocked a requirement that workers at large employers be vaccinated or test regularly and wear a mask on the job.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey, speaking at a recent event in  Washington , cast the power plant case as about who should make the rules. \u201cShould it be unelected bureaucrats, or should it be the people\u2019s representatives in Congress?\" Morrisey said. West Virginia is leading the states opposed to broad EPA authority. But David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Supreme Court's consideration of the issue is premature, a view shared by the administration. He said the administration's opponents are advancing \u201chorror stories about extreme regulations the EPA may issue in the future. The EPA is writing a new rule on a clean slate.\u201d The power plant case has a long and complicated history that begins with the Obama administration's  Clean Power Plan . That plan would have required states to reduce emissions from the generation of electricity, mainly by shifting away from coal-fired plants.  But that plan never took effect. Acting in a lawsuit filed by West Virginia and others, the Supreme Court blocked it in 2016 by a 5-4 vote, with conservatives in the majority. With the plan on hold, the legal fight over it continued. But after President Donald Trump took office, the EPA repealed the Obama-era plan. The agency argued that its authority to reduce carbon emissions was limited and it devised a new plan that sharply reduced the federal government's role in the issue. New York, 21 other mainly Democratic states, the District of Columbia and some of the nation's largest cities sued over the Trump plan. The federal appeals court in Washington ruled against both the repeal and the new plan, and its decision left nothing in effect while the new administration drafted a new policy.  Adding to the unusual nature of the high court's involvement, the reductions sought in the Obama plan by 2030 already have been achieved through the market-driven closure of hundreds of coal plants. The Biden administration has no intention of reviving the Clean Power Plan, one reason Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, argues the court should dismiss the case.  Some of the nation's largest electric utilities, serving 40 million people, are supporting the Biden administration along with prominent businesses that include Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla.  A decision is expected by late June.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Why, despite overwhelming scientific evidence, do some people cling to the belief that the climate crisis is not man-made? Sam Webb speaks to the experts Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that the  climate crisis is caused by human behaviour . But despite this consensus, and news reports showing the climate crisis destroying lives across the planet, a worrying number of people still cling to the belief the climate crisis is not man-made, or even deny it exists. The situation is improving. A total of 72 per cent of Britons think the climate crisis is a result of human activity, according to YouGov research.  Less than 10 years ago only half of people thought humanity was to blame. But 13 per cent believe climate crisis is not due to human activity and 3 per cent of people  do not think the climate is changing at all. In the US 72 per cent think global warming is happening, but only 57 per cent think it is mostly caused by human activities, according to the Yale Program on Climate Communication. What drives climate denial? Megan Kennedy-Woodard is a coaching psychologist and co-founder of Climate Psychologists. She is also the co-author of  Turn the Tide on Climate Anxiety, Sustainable Climate Action for Your Mental Health and the Planet. She says there are two different factors at play when it comes to the issue \u2013 denial and denialism. Denial is a defence mechanism for individuals and groups who find it difficult to engage with climate science and the reality we will face if action is not taken. She said: \u201cDenial is a psychological defence that can in some cases protect us from information that would otherwise be too traumatic to immediately process. For example, if a loved one is suddenly killed our first thoughts are often, \u2018No. It\u2019s not true.\u2019 \u201cWe say that a little bit of denial is OK in climate action because if we only perceive the crisis we are in, it would be hard to carry on with necessary climate action, let alone get out of bed in the morning. \u201cSo we can view a small amount of denial as helpful just as we can view a small amount of  anxiety or anger , as long as we still engage and it doesn\u2019t weigh too much on our mental health. We can nod to these emotions without bowing to them.\u201d Megan Kennedy-Woodard is an expert in climate psychology Then there is constructed denialism, which Kennedy-Woodard says has been cultivated and perpetuated by multi-million-pound disinformation campaigns primarily stemming from the fossil fuel industry and the politicians they target. \u201cThese seeds of denial have been sewn to purposefully discredit science and the human influence of change on our planet,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people don\u2019t believe or grasp it. We can\u2019t wholly blame the people targeted by these campaigns for their denial. \u201cFor some, the climate crisis feels too big to engage with and yes, there is the element of burying our heads in the sand, but as we see increases in extreme weather, climate migration, loss of life, this will become more and more difficult.\u201d Discounting the problem Dr Rachel McCloy, an Associate Professor in Applied Behavioural Science at the University of Reading, is an expert in the fields of understanding pro-environmental behaviours, food choice, and applying  psychology  to public policy issues. She says most people accept to some degree that the climate crisis is real, but choose to ignore or do little about it. \u201cThe psychological drivers here include what we call discounting (living for today at the expense of tomorrow) and our emotional responses to large scale negative events,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the behavioural economist Dan Ariely has pointed out, if we were trying to design a problem that people wouldn\u2019t care about we would design something that looks a lot like climate change\u2013 its full extent is uncertain, it takes place in the future and may not be directly experienced by the person making choices, and will have its first effects remotely from many people. \u201cAll of these things can increase  short-term thinking  at the expense of longer-term planning. \u201cIt is also the case that the impact changes to a single person\u2019s behaviour may have are minimal and are dependent upon the collective actions of others. \u201cThis can lead to feelings of a lack of control, which, alongside fears of potential large-scale negative events, can lead us to stick our heads in the sand as a protective mechanism.\u201d Dr Rachel McCloy of the University of Reading Fringe figures Kennedy-Woodward says climate crisis deniers seek out fringe news websites and media figures like  Jordan Peterson  because they offer comfort. \u201cHuman brains love to feel like they are right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe deliberately seek out information that corresponds\u00a0and maintains our belief systems.\u201d \u201cAlso, we want to feel like we are part of the community we identify with. This can serve as an echo chamber and make it difficult to form opinions and listen to \u2018outsiders\u2019, scientists in this case, who appeal to our rationale more frequently rather than our emotions. \u201cIf these outspoken, yet unqualified fringe celebrities\u00a0appeal to them or they feel they can identify with them, it is very easy for them to blindly follow and they absolutely can cultivate division and be exploitive. \u201c(Social media) algorithms lead people to these sources and make them appear more credible or popular than they actually are but when people are afraid or insecure, they may not necessarily be assessing the situation in a logical way.\u201d This emotion may lead climate crisis deniers\u00a0to viciously attack prominent climate activists like  Greta Thunberg. Kennedy-Woodward added: \u201cThere is a lot of \u2018othering\u2019 that occurs in our world that is so deeply divided right now. \u201cCertain scientists, and now activists like Greta, are victims of what Michael Mann has called the \u2018Serengeti Strategy\u2019 meaning they are separated off and hunted like prey by the politically and economically motivated. \u201cPeople get on the bandwagon, go along with their in-group and vilify those who don\u2019t share their point of view.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Increased temperatures not only make heatwaves more extreme and wildfires more likely, they also tamper with weather patterns, making storms more intense.  As part of the study, scientists looked at three storms in  North Carolina  from the past 20 years \u2013 hurricanes Floyd, Matthew and Florence.  They found the probability of them occurring randomly in such a short period of time is just two per cent.  \u201cNorth Carolina has one of the highest impact zones of tropical cyclones in the world, and we have these carefully kept records that shows us that the last 20 years of precipitation events have been off the charts,\u201d said Professor Hans Paerl, lead author of the study published in the journal  Scientific Reports . Reuters Getty Reuters PA Getty PA Reuters Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP PA Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters Getty Reuters Getty AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty Getty Reuters Reuters EPA AP AFP\/Getty PA EPA EPA PA Getty  AP AFP\/Getty Reuters AP PA AP The scientists analysed records of tropical cyclone landfalls and rainfall associated with Costal North Carolina storms since 1898.  They found that six out of the seven largest hurricanes, tropical storms and floods occurred in the last 20 years. This frequency is probably caused by \u201cincreased moisture carrying capacity of tropical cyclones due to the warming climate\u201d, the study said. As well as more storms, North Carolina has also experienced unprecedented levels of rainfall since the late 1990s. In the long term it has also seen an increase in rainfall from tropical storms over the past 120 years.  This is increasingly problematic as the state is now home to more than 10.3 million people and climate change is already having a devastating impact on people\u2019s lives.  \u201cThe price we\u2019re paying is that we\u2019re having to cope with increasing levels of catastrophic flooding,\u201d said Professor Paerl, from the University of North Carolina\u2019s Institute of Marine Sciences.  \u201cCoastal watersheds are having to absorb more rain. Let\u2019s go back to Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which flooded half of the coastal plain of North Carolina. Then, we had Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Just recently we had Hurricane Florence in 2018. These events are causing a huge amount of human suffering, economic and ecological damage.\u201d Increased rainfall results in more runoff into coastal waters and estuaries. This results in organic matter and nutrient losses from soil erosion which results in damaging algal blooms.  \u201cWe are in part responsible for what\u2019s going on in the context of fossil fuel combustion emissions that are leading to global warming,\u201d Prof Paerl said. \u201cThe ocean is a huge reservoir that is absorbing heat and seeing more evaporation. With more evaporation comes more rainfall.\u201d At the end of last year, research found that extreme weather events cost the world billions of pounds in the previous 12 months.  The report by Christian Aid identified 10 of the most expensive natural disasters that struck in 2018, all of which cost at least $1bn (\u00a3790m) each. The costs established for these events are likely to be underestimates, as they often only included insured losses and did not take into account long-term costs to productivity.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Global warming is coming for your wine, and it\u2019s starting with the good stuff Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Many of the world\u2019s most revered  vineyards  may face the choice of diversifying the grape varieties they grow or risk harvesting smaller and smaller crops, as  climate change  brings less favourable conditions. Even if the world manage to rein in the  greenhouse gas emissions  causing average global temperatures to rise as the  Paris agreement  outlines \u2013 limiting global warming to 2C \u2013 then the regions of the world suitable for growing  wine  grapes could shrink by as much as 56 per cent. Currently humanity is not on course to meet that target. Emissions over 2019 were 4 per cent higher than when the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, and the  United Nations  has warned that current trends put the planet on course for a 3.4C temperature rise over the next 80 years. A new study warns that under a potential scenario of 4C of warming, 85 per cent of lands suitable for vineyards would no longer be able to produce good wines because the grapes are extremely sensitive to the changes in temperature and season brought by  climate change . \u201cIn some ways, wine is like the canary in the coal mine for climate change impacts on agriculture, because these grapes are so climate-sensitive,\u201d said Benjamin Cook from Columbia University and the  Nasa  Goddard Institute for Space Studies, co-author of the study. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty But all hope is not yet lost.  \u201cThere are still opportunities to adapt viticulture to a warmer world,\u201d said Professor Cook. \u201cIt just requires taking the problem of climate change seriously.\u201d The study suggests wine producers could look at diversifying their crop by \u201creshuffling\u201d grape varieties. Such a move could halve the potential losses of wine-growing regions under 2C of warming, the authors say. The team suggests crop diversity could be key to making agriculture more resilient to climate change, and said wine grapes offer a unique opportunity to test this assumption.  Wine grapes are both extremely diverse \u2013 there are more than 1,100 different varieties planted today, growing under a wide range of conditions \u2013 and they are well-documented, with harvest data stretching back centuries.  The researchers \u2013 led by Ignacio Morales-Castilla at the University of Alcal\u00e1 in Spain and Elizabeth Wolkovich at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver \u2013 focused on 11 varieties of grape: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chasselas, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Monastrell (also known as Mourvedre), Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah and Ugni Blanc. For the 11 varieties, the team used vintner and researcher archives to build a model for when each would bud, flower, and ripen in winegrowing regions around the world under three different warming scenarios: 0, 2, and 4C of warming. Then they used climate change projections to examine which regions those varieties would still be viable in the future. Losses were unavoidable under both warming scenarios, due to shifting temperatures and seasonal changes which would affect conditions while the varieties were ripening. These factors would considerably impact the wines\u2019 quality. But the team found that \u201cby switching these varieties around, you can reduce losses by a significant amount\u201d, said Professor Cook. With 2C of global warming and no attempts at adaptation, 56 per cent of the world\u2019s wine-growing areas may no longer be suitable for growing wine. But if wine producers switch to varieties more suitable for the changing climate, only 24 per cent would be lost.  For example, in France\u2019s Burgundy region, the authors suggest heat-loving Mourvedre and Grenache could replace current varieties such as Pinot Noir. In Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot could also be replaced with Mourvedre. Implementing such major cultural changes in areas steeped in rich viticulture history would be a significant challenge, as would the legal position \u2013 strict rules govern the grapes used in wines sold as coming from particular regions. However, some change is already afoot. For example, in Bordeaux, where Cabernet S auvignon dominates blends, just a handful of grapes including Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec were previously permitted to be used.  But this changed in July 2019. Bordeaux wineries  reportedly authorised  the use of four new red grapes to combat temperature increases in Bordeaux. They are: Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa. \u201cConversations in Europe have already begun about new legislation to make it easier for major regions to change the varieties they grow,\u201d said Dr Wolkovich.  \u201cBut growers still must learn to grow these new varieties. That\u2019s a big hurdle in some regions that have grown the same varieties for hundreds and hundreds of years, and they need consumers who are willing to accept different varieties from their favourite regions.\u201d The scientists said cooler wine-growing regions such as Germany, New Zealand and the US Pacific Northwest would be relatively unscathed under the 2C scenario. These areas could become suitable for warmer varieties like Merlot and Grenache, while varieties that prefer cooler temperatures, such as Pinot Noir, could expand northward into regions not currently suitable for growing wine. Wine-growing regions that are already hot now \u2013 such as Italy, Spain, and Australia \u2013 faced the largest losses, because they are already limited to planting the warmest varieties. The variety-swapping was less effective at higher amounts of global warming. With 4C of warming, planting climate-specific varieties reduced losses from 85 to 58 per cent \u2013 about a third. The researchers note that management practices like increased irrigation and using shade cloths can also help to protect grapevines, but only at lower levels of warming. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any strategy depends on growers having the options and resources to adapt at a local scale, and on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting warming globally, the authors said.

Calling for world leaders to be guided by the scientific evidence rather than \u201chide their heads in the sand\u201d, they said \u201centire ecosystems\u201d were already beginning to collapse, summer sea ice was disappearing in the Arctic and coral reefs were dying from the heat. The world could emit enough carbon to bust the  Paris Agreement  target of between 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius in anything from four to 26 years if current levels continue, the article said. Global emissions had been rising rapidly but have plateaued in recent years. The experts, led by Christiana Figueres, who as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change played a key role in the Paris Agreement, said they must start to fall rapidly from 2020 at the latest. \u201cThe year 2020 is crucially important for another reason, one that has more to do with physics than politics,\u201d they said. Citing a report published in April, they added: \u201cShould emissions continue to rise beyond 2020, or even remain level, the temperature goals set in Paris become almost unattainable. \u201cLowering emissions globally is a monumental task, but research tells us that it is necessary, desirable and achievable.\u201d The article was signed by more than 60 scientists, such as Professor Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, politicians, including former Mexican President Felipe Calderon and ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, businesspeople like Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, investment managers, environmental campaigners and others. Since the 1880s, the world\u2019s temperature has risen by about 1C because of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity \u2013 a process predicted by a Swedish Nobel Prize-winning scientist in 1895. The  Nature  article laid out the effect of this sudden increase on the planet. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cIce sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are already losing mass at an increasing rate,\u201d it said. \u201cSummer sea ice is disappearing in the Arctic and coral reefs are dying from heat stress \u2013 entire ecosystems are starting to collapse.\u201d And it added: \u201cThe social impacts of  climate change  from intensified heatwaves, droughts and sea-level rise are inexorable and affect the poorest and weakest first.\u201d Humanity is currently emitting about 41 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, but if the Paris target is to be met it only has a carbon \u2018budget\u2019 of between 150 and 1,050 gigatonnes. \u201cIf the current rate of annual emissions stays at this level, we would have to drop them almost immediately to zero once we exhaust the budget. Such a \u2018jump to distress\u2019 is in no one\u2019s interest. A more gradual descent would allow the global economy time to adapt smoothly,\u201d the experts wrote. But they urged people not to abandon hope. \u201cThe good news is that it is still possible to meet the Paris temperature goals if emissions begin to fall by 2020,\u201d they said. Donald Trump , the US President and climate science-denier, has  pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement , which will take until 2020. The  Nature  article urged world leaders to take the opposite approach by using science to guide policy and defending scientists. \u201cThose in power must stand up for science,\u201d it said. \u201cFrench President Emmanuel  Macron\u2019s Make Our Planet Great Again campaign  [a deliberate play on Mr Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again slogan] is a compelling example. \u201cHe has spoken out to a global audience in support of climate scientists, and invited researchers to move to France to help accelerate action and deliver on the Paris agreement.\u201d Any delay would pose a threat to human prosperity. \u201cWith no time to wait, all countries should adopt plans for achieving 100 per cent renewable electricity production, while ensuring that markets can be designed to enable renewable-energy expansion,\u201d the experts wrote. Optimism was also important. \u201cRecent political events have thrown the future of our world into sharp focus,\u201d they said. \u201cBut as before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it\u2019s an attitude. It is crucial that success stories are shared. \u201cThere will always be those who hide their heads in the sand and ignore the global risks of climate change. \u201cBut there are many more of us committed to overcoming this inertia. Let us stay optimistic and act boldly together.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The head of a Philippines Commission on Human Rights panel, which has been investigating  climate change  for three years, revealed its conclusions on Monday that major fossil fuel firms may be held legally responsible for the impacts of their carbon emissions.  The announcement was made by commissioner Roberto Cadiz during  COP25   international climate talks  in Madrid, which have seen a growing focus on human rights issues. The commission was tasked in 2016 by Greenpeace South-East Asia and other local environmental groups whether 47 of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel firms \u2013 including Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 were violating the rights of Filipino citizens. It held hearings in Manila, New York and London where it heard from scientists, lawyers and people who had suffered from climate-related disasters. Its final report, which has yet to be published, will say that these companies have clear legal and moral responsibilities to act, which includes shifting away from  fossil fuels  and investing in cleaner energy sources. Greenpeace Southeast Asia executive director Yeb Sa\u00f1o described the inquiry\u2019s conclusions as a \u201clandmark victory for climate justice\u201d. AFP\/Getty Alan Schaller Nasa\/Getty Ross Wills AP Reuters AFP\/Getty Art Wolfe He noted that a growing number of cases related to climate change are now being filed in courts across the world \u201cand with the conclusion of this investigation, we believe many more communities will take a stand against fossil fuel companies that are putting profit before people\u201d. ExxonMobil, for example, one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas firms, has faced multiple legal challenges from US states and shareholders who claim it misled investors and the public over the real risks of climate change. And in Germany, utility firm RWE is being sued by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya whose home is at risk from a melting glacier. The human rights implications of climate change cannot be avoided during the ongoing talks in  Madrid , but observers fear that attempts to include human rights protections in the  finer details of the Paris Agreement are failing .  In September the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet  described the climate crisis  as a \u201crapidly growing and global threat to human rights\u201d and said no countries or institutions could stand on the sidelines without acting on it. On Tuesday, a group of young people including Swedish teenage activist  Greta Thunberg  will send a letter to the prime ministers of Norway and Canada accusing them of violating children's rights by supporting new oil and gas development. They had already lodged a  petition  with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in September, saying Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey are perpetuating the climate crisis by failing to curb emissions and promoting fossil fuels. During her first official appearance at the talks, Thunberg also sought to draw attention to the plight of Indigenous Peoples and other vulnerable groups by handing the microphone over to a diverse panel of young people. Activists from Indigenous backgrounds and developing nations, who are disproportionately at risk from climate change despite contributing little to global carbon emissions, feel their stories have been sidelined in political discussions and the wider media. Angela Valenzuela, an activist from Chile, which was originally due to host the talks, said she had found it \u201coutrageous\u201d that her government had tried to clean up its image in Madrid \u201cwhile committing human rights violations every day\u201d. \"While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments the world is literally burning out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are courageous.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile THE BACKGROUND: Melting glaciers, deadly floods in  Germany  record high summer temperatures in generally mild  Oregon  more urgent pleas for help from  Pacific  island nations. With growing urgency, the effects of climate change were felt around the world in 2021. A  United Nations  climate conference in Glascow, Scotland, in November \u2014 called COP26 \u2014 ended with almost 200 nations agreeing to a compromise aimed at keeping a key global warming target alive, but which contained a last-minute change that watered down language about phasing out coal. While many nations complained the deal did not go far or fast enough, they said it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress. Here, some  Associated Press  journalists involved in the coverage reflect on the story and their own experiences. ____ SETH BORENSTEIN, science writer, Washington, D.C.: COP26 leaves us sort of where we were before. There\u2019s a little bit more being done to try to control emissions, a lot more pledges to do stuff. But a lot of these pledges are still based very much in the future. These net-zero by 2050, 2060 pledges \u2014 these are pledges made by leaders who won\u2019t be alive when their pledges become due. This has also been an interesting year where you had a major climate report in August. But more than anything, it\u2019s yet another year where climate change keeps popping up in extreme weather all over the world. But this year, perhaps a little bit more in the Western, richer countries than in the past: in Germany, in Belgium, horrible flooding in Tennessee, places like that. And not to mention the wildfires and 116-degree (47 Celsius) heat in Portland, Oregon. I mean, if you had to choose one weird thing, the Pacific Northwest is known for mildness, but there are records and then there are records, and theirs are so far off the scale that your eyes pop out. And that\u2019s what Portland was. ___ Rich countries aren't exempt. But when you're rich, you can flee that more easily. You can weather weather extremes when you're in the global North far better than you can in the South. But then, there come extremes that are so big, that wealth can't help you as much. ___ And so that\u2019s one of the issues of adaptation: the rich countries of the world can, and the poor countries can\u2019t. And that was one of the major issues we saw in Scotland at the conference. What we saw ... is this sort of combination of hope because nations were saying the right thing and pledging the right thing to do that would help reduce emissions in the future. More so than they\u2019ve ever done. And yet, the temperatures are still going up, the extremes are still getting worse. So you sort of have this combination of optimism \u2014 and there was a lot of optimism there \u2014 and also harsh reality smacking each other in the face. And you would ping-pong there from \u201cOh, this looks promising\u201d to \u201cOh my God.\u201d ___ FRANK JORDANS, correspondent, Berlin: Thinking about what was special about covering climate this year, it struck me that normally, covering climate change from Germany is a bit like covering a war 100 miles from the front line, right? Because you sort of think all the action is happening somewhere else. And it\u2019s certainly true that most of the direst impact is happening in countries in what\u2019s known as the global south. Or the far north, because that\u2019s heating up much faster than anywhere else.  But this year, we had two events in Germany that were really quite striking. One of them was a Supreme Court decision in April here in Germany. Basically the court ruled that the government hadn\u2019t done enough to chart the course that the country needs to set if it wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to meet these Paris goals. And the judges basically said that they were putting too much of the strain on younger generations, pushing too much to beyond 2030. And they said that this was actually a restriction on freedoms of the younger generation. ... The judges in the Supreme Court here actually said that if we don\u2019t tackle climate change, then core freedoms are going to be impinged upon. And by saying that, that was a hugely significant moment that could change the trajectory of how future governments see things. The second one was these floods that Seth mentioned in Germany and Belgium. Certainly, there are occasional floods here, but nothing like what we saw in July. And while some people said, well, we should have seen this coming, really, the general population was not prepared for this. And it really woke people up to see almost 200 people killed in a matter of hours, and entire villages swept away. In a country like Germany, I mean, they can afford to rebuild, but it\u2019s still billions (in damages) in one devastating flood. ___ NOAH BERGER, photographer, San Francisco: I\u2019ve been a news photographer for 26 years, so I\u2019ve done a bunch wildfires here and there. But really, 2013\u2019s Rim Fire near Yosemite was the first one that got me focused on this as a specialty. I went out there and spent a few days there with a colleague from Getty, we were riding around, and I just loved being out there. In California, we have press access to emergency zones. .... So, when I started, it was more an issue of how close you could get yourself because I didn\u2019t have all the tools that I have now. It was harder to know the right spots to be in, but it was a powerful experience. And after that, I said, this is what I want to do with my summers and falls. And every year since then, I\u2019ve really ramped up the gear that I use, the knowledge I have, the interactions with firefighters. Whether it\u2019s something physical, like a carbon monoxide detector for the car, or fire shelter, or a better understanding of firefighting techniques.  Every year I\u2019ve increased my fire knowledge. And it\u2019s worked out well, because our fires have also ramped up incredibly. Every year since then, with a couple exceptions, you just see new superlatives: more homes, more lives lost, more intensity. Especially since about 2015.  The firefighters are easy to interact with. I\u2019m dressed like a firefighter. I know the lingo. You know, I pull up and they know I\u2019m not a firefighter, but I also blend in. ... I always have a hard time with (civilians). I mean, we go up to somebody, and usually it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s either fleeing their home as flames bear down, in immediate danger or returning to their leveled home. And it\u2019s really hard to go up to people as a human. You know, it\u2019s one of the worst days of their lives and you say, \"Hey, can I hang out with you?\" ___ I think the intensity has been startling for all of us, and how much it\u2019s increased. I don\u2019t know what percentage you can put on climate change, what percentage on PG&E, what percent on the bark beetle tree mortality, which was part of the drought here, where a lot of trees have are very flammable and combustible. But it\u2019s pretty indisputable that the fires have definitely intensified. I think you could look up the exact figure. But, according to CalFire, our state firefighting agency, 15 out of 20 of California\u2019s most destructive wildfires have occurred in the last six years. It\u2019s a very striking statistic. I\u2019ve only been doing this for eight years, and I\u2019ve covered 14 of the 20 most destructive wildfires in California history. ___ For a full overview of the events that shaped 2021, \u201cA Year That Changed Us: 12 Months in 150 Photos,\u201d a collection of AP photos and journalists\u2019 recollections, is available now: https:\/\/www.ap.org\/books\/a-year-that-changed-us Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Doing so, according to the report, means that in California alone around 555,000 premature deaths would be avoided, along with 400,000 ER visits and hospital stays for cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and nearly 5,000 hospitalizations for children suffering from asthma. The report also found that nearly 32 per cent of premature deaths caused by air pollution in California could be eliminated in a decade. The economic value of these health benefits would be nearly $4.5 trillion, it stated. In recent months, California has battled raging wildfires and since August 15, there have been 26 fatalities, 6,700 structures destroyed and thousands of people displaced. The state has also faced widespread drought and dangerously high heatwaves. The subcommittee report emphasized that benefits are maximized if the US works with other nations under the Paris deal, but that \u201cthere are substantial benefits with unilateral action\u201d. Over 15 years, \u201cunilateral action would achieve 80 per cent of the avoided premature deaths in the state that would result from global action\u201d. President Trump, who has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and rolled back dozens of climate and environmental regulations while in office, is committed to withdrawing from the Paris agreement if he is re-elected in November. The research was conducted by Dr Drew Shindell, Nicholas Distinguished Professor of Earth Sciences at Duke University. \u201cOne of the key findings of this report is that the United States can save lives, reduce illnesses, and save trillions of dollars by acting now on its own\u2014at a local, state, regional, and national level\u2014to eliminate the primary impacts of fossil-fuel pollution,\u201d the report states.\u00a0 Democratic members of the committee, Chair Harley Rouda and California Reps.

The full Federal Court decided unanimously in favour of the appeal by Environment Minister Sussan Ley against a judge\u2019s ruling that she had a duty of care to avoid harming children when weighing approval for a coal project. The court ruled \"the duty should not be imposed upon the Minister\". Australia  is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coal used in power generation, in terms of export volume. It ranked  \u201cdead last\u201d  for the climate action taken among comparable developed countries since nations pledged in the 2015\u00a0 Paris \u00a0agreement to take steps to limit global warming, according to a report from the Climate Council in October. The original ruling, which related to approval of a coal mine extension in the state of New South Wales, was seen as setting a precedent for other mine applications. Ms Ley approved the mine, run by Whitehaven Coal, last September ahead of the appeal. Emissions from burning the coal from the mine project were estimated at 100 million tonnes of  carbon dioxide-equivalent . The case was brought by eight schoolchildren and a nun seeking to require Australia\u2019s environment minister to protect children from future harm caused by  climate change . Some of the children had gathered outside the court in Sydney to await the ruling and were left in tears when the decision was announced. \"Today\u2019s ruling leaves us devastated, but it will not deter us in our fight for climate justice,\" Anjali Sharma, 17, one of the students who brought the original case, said in a statement. Chief Justice James Allsop said the duty of care should not be imposed because the minister could not be held liable for \"all damage by heatwaves, bushfires and rising sea levels to all Australians under the age of 18, ongoing into the future\". The court also said the duty would not fit with the minister\u2019s role set out in the environmental protection law that governs mine approvals. Anti-coal activists Lock the Gate said the judgement, coming in the wake of  historic flooding  on the country\u2019s east coast, showed Australia\u2019s environmental laws are too weak. Ms Ley welcomed the decision and said the government remained committed to protecting the environment.

And in recent years, another question has crept up, fuelled by the looming  climate crisis : what is the impact of having children on the  planet ? The question hangs heavy for many young people as topics of  sustainability  and the  future  of the planet dominate the news agenda, and  overpopulation  is often cited as a factor. The first academic study of the issue last year found that an overwhelming number of people who are concerned about the climate crisis are deciding not to have children over fears their next of kin would struggle in the future. The survey  of 600 people aged 27 to 45 found that 96 per cent were very or extremely concerned about the wellbeing of their potential future children in a world ravaged by climate change. It also revealed deeply pessimistic views of the future, with 92.3 per cent of 400 respondents offering a negative vision of the future and only 0.6 per cent were positive. The scientific consensus is that having children is the highest impact action an individual can do to create a lifetime of carbon emissions. A 2017 study carried out by climate scientists Kimberley Nicholas and Seth Wynes found that a child born into the developed world leaves a 58.6 metric tonne carbon footprint annually. The study,  published in  Environmental Research , recommended that individuals reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by having one fewer child, living car-free, avoiding air travel and eating a plant-based diet. The authors added: \u201cThese actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household light bulbs (eight times less).\u201d Most recently, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle brought the issue into the spotlight after the birth of their second \u2013 and last \u2013 child in June this year. Before Meghan became pregnant with Lilibet, Harry told  British Vogue  that they were planning to have a \u201cmaximum\u201d of two children. Now we know that having a smaller family is actually one of the most effective steps they can take - and it\u2019s no longer a fringe idea The couple were  named as environmental \u201crole models\u201d  by UK-based charity Population Matters, which campaigns for a \u201csustainable human population\u201d. The charity said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision would help \u201censure a better future for their children\u201d. So how heavily should climate change factor into our decision to have children, or more children? The answer is not clear-cut and has sparked debate across academic and scientific communities for years. The issue of overpopulation is often cited as a reason not to have more children as the world seems to hurtle towards environmental devastation. As the Earth\u2019s resources are finite, it cannot support unlimited population growth \u2013 however, the guzzling of resources has also been linked to the  consumption habits of high-income countries  that have slower population growth rates than the rest of the world. However, climate change is also driven by households.  Studies have shown  that through consumption, households are responsible for 72 per cent of global greenhouse emissions, making them key factors in reaching goals set by the Paris Agreement. Alistair Currie from Population Matters, which encourages people to have smaller families to achieve a sustainable population, told  The Independent : \u201cAccording to the UN Environment Programme, around two-thirds of all emissions are linked to households.\u00a0 On average, someone in the UK will be responsible for four-and-a-half times the emissions of someone in India, or 25 times the emissions of someone in Burkina Faso. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut that and people are already taking positive steps, like changing their diets - something very few people were doing just a few years ago. Now we know that having a smaller family is actually one of the most effective steps they can take - and it\u2019s no longer a fringe idea. \u201cIn fact, in a recent poll we conducted, nearly a third (31 per cent) of 18 to 24-year-olds said they wanted to have fewer or no children because of concerns about their future environmental impact. \u201c We only have the next few years to solve the climate crisis reasonably well However, Kimberly Nicholas, a climate scientist who co-authored the 2017 study that recommended people have fewer children, said in her 2021 book \u201c Under The Sky We Make \u201d that if someone really wants to become a parent, they should go ahead. She  told  Vox  that reducing the population will not \u201csolve the climate crisis\u201d, adding that making the switch to sustainable agriculture was more urgent in the effort to reverse climate change. \u201cThe reason for that is that we only have the next few years to solve the climate crisis reasonably well,\u201d said Ms Nicholas. \u201cWe know that we have this limited carbon budget that determines how much warming we\u2019re going to experience. We\u2019re really close to scary and dangerous limits right now. \u201cAnd we know what we have to do, which is leave fossil fuels in the ground and switch to regenerative and sustainable agriculture. That\u2019s what our job is basically in this next decade.\u201d In global terms, it is estimated that agriculture is directly responsible for up to 8.5 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, with a further 14.5 per cent coming from land use change. According to the IPCC\u2019s Special Report on Climate Change in 2019, this land change is mainly comprised of deforestation in developing countries to clear land for food production. A much larger contributor to greenhouse gas emissions are fossil fuel companies, 20 of which have been directly linked to more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Ms Nicholas\u2019s study measured the long-term impact of having a child in today\u2019s climate, which took into account the likelihood that that child would go on to have their own children, creating further generations. But she said that if people feel strongly about having children, and if they feel as though they have \u201ca child-shaped hole\u201d in their hearts, they should go ahead and become parents. However, Mr Currie pointed out that Nicholas\u2019 own study suggests that having one fewer child could be 20 times more effective than some other steps people are taking to reduce their carbon emissions. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s not to say people shouldn\u2019t do the others. We have to do many other things too as a society and as individuals - this is no panacea but it makes a big difference, and we know now that big differences are what we need.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Wade , and potentially a disputed presidential election.\u00a0 Judge Barrett expertly deflected some lines of questioning, insisting she would bring no personal agenda to the court but decide cases \u201cas they come\". On Tuesday, Republican Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana, pursued questions aimed at, as he put it, showing what President Trump\u2019s nominee \u201cthought about the world\u201d. \u201cDo you have some opinions on climate change that you\u2019ve thought about?\u201d Sen Kennedy asked. Judge Barrett replied: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m certainly not a scientist.\u201d When asked to expand on her answer, she continued: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve read things about climate change. I would not say that I have firm views on it.\u201d The well-worn Republican talking point of \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist\u201d has allowed a host of elected officials to equivocate on the scientific consensus on climate change, despite  polls that show  most Americans accept the  reality of the crisis  and want the government to take action. Some 97 per cent or more of climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities,\u00a0 NASA \u00a0reports. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, \u00a0Florida Governor\u00a0Rick Scott,\u00a0and former House Speaker John Boehner, all have all made similar \u201cnot a scientist\u201d pitches when asked about the climate crisis. Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist, previously told the  New York Times  that it was \u201cthe dumbest answer I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. \u00a0He added: \u201cUsing that logic would disqualify politicians from voting on anything. Most politicians aren\u2019t scientists, but they vote on science policy. They have opinions on Ebola, but they\u2019re not epidemiologists. They shape highway and infrastructure laws, but they\u2019re not engineers.\u201d Judge Barrett has a  slim judiciary record  on environmental issues, and a question on climate change did not come up after she was nominated to the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit by President Trump in 2017. The judge\u2019s conservative views are at odds with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal icon who she will replace. She would be Mr Trump\u2019s third justice and her ascension is expected to tip the court 6-3 to the right.\u00a0 AP contributed to this report Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple. The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered \u2018carbonic acid\u2019 \u2013 today known as carbon dioxide \u2013 was one of a number of \u201c perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours \u201d to absorb radiant heat. He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be \u201cheld fast in the iron grip of frost\u201d. About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  would cause the global temperature to go up , particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise. This is one of the certainties in climate science \u2013 the world has got warmer. Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was  about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level , according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen  average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C  compared to the average between 1961 and 1990. In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of  glaciers retreating  and  sea ice melting to record lows ,  sea levels rising by 20cm ,  islands disappearing ,  animals and plants shifting their ranges  and  spring coming several weeks earlier . Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage \u2013 which claimed the  lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China  \u2013 is now so free of ice that people  can take a cruise  through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming. It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally. As  Nasa puts it : \u201cThere is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\u201d All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming. But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment. Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and  some of the ruling US politicians , no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK\u2019s leading \u2018sceptic\u2019 think tank,  Nigel Lawson\u2019s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees . Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a  so-called \u2018lukewarmist\u2019 position , arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air. Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which  a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory  near the poles. Both groups are at odds with the science. As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),  explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society , the \u2018scientific consensus\u2019 on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes. According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million \u2013 a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s \u2013 to  more than 400ppm today . \u201cWhen we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it\u2019s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it\u2019s not individual predictions,\u201d Professor Palmer told the Royal Society. But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly \u2018dangerous\u2019. And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also \u201ca non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic\u201d. Models are often the source of derision from climate \u2018sceptics\u2019 or \u2018deniers\u2019, but they have actually proved  remarkably successful when measured against actual observations . Even Arrhenius\u2019 prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true. Most of the world \u2013 Donald Trump and some of his supporters aside \u2013 has come to the conclusion that fossil fuel use should be phased out rapidly to try to minimise the chances that devastating storms, deadly heatwaves, floods, droughts and other extreme weather events will wreak havoc to an unprecedented extent. Some of the hottest and most humid parts of the world are already getting close to the point where humans are no longer be able to lose enough heat to stay alive outdoors. A 5C average temperature rise might not sound like much to some, but that was about  the difference between now and the last global Ice Age  when Britain was covered with glaciers. It is thought prudent to restrict warming to a much lower level. Under  the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change , the world agreed to try to keep the temperature rise to \"well below 2C ... and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\". The tougher target was set amid evidence that at some point between 1.5C to 2C of warming changes could occur that  lock in major sea level rise  for hundreds or even thousands of years. Professor Richard Betts, a leading Met Office scientist who has also worked on the IPCC's reports, said: \u201cIt comes down to how much risk you want to take. \u201cThe lukewarmist position that [global warming] is going to be at the low end is not, sadly, based on the full range of the science. \u201cIt is within the range of possibilities, but I don\u2019t know how you can be confident in that position. \u201cYou are arguing from a position in the hope that it is true.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The planet-warming power of  methane gas emitted by cows  is well known, but their urine is also a contributor to climate change. When the animals urinate on pastures, they produce the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, which like methane has a far more powerful climate effect that CO2. Previous research  on the Somerset Levels in the UK has shown how adding cow urine to grassland stimulates gas production by adding nitrogen to the system and increasing soil water content. In a new study, scientists investigated the levels of nitrous oxide coming from cow pastures across Latin America and the Caribbean after pouring samples of urine onto them. AFP\/Getty Alan Schaller Nasa\/Getty Ross Wills AP Reuters AFP\/Getty Art Wolfe They found that while the urine inevitably produced greenhouse gases, up to three times as much came from grassland that suffered from overgrazing and low soil quality. With degraded land covering 150 million hectares of Latin America, this finding adds a further incentive to restore these pastures to their former quality.  \u201cDegraded pastures are bad in so many ways,\u201d said Dr Ngonidzashe Chirinda, a researcher at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture and the study\u2019s lead author.  \u201cThis study adds to the case for land restoration. Degraded pastures not only affect food security and the livelihood of farmers today, but affects the livelihood of future farmers because they emit more gases that cause global warming.\u201d Farm emissions are a  major contributor to climate change , releasing CO2, methane and nitrous oxide that accounts for 10 per cent of emissions in the UK alone.

But it is not the only Australian  ecosystem  on the brink of collapse. Our research, recently published in Nature Climate Change, describes a series of sudden and catastrophic ecosystem shifts that have occurred recently across  Australia . These changes, caused by the combined stress of gradual climate change and  extreme weather  events, are overwhelming ecosystems\u2019 natural resilience. Australia is one of the most climatically variable places in the world. It is filled with ecosystems adapted to this variability, whether that means living in scorching heat, bitter cold or a climate that cycles between the two. Despite land clearing, mining and other activities that transform the natural landscape, Australia retains large tracts of near-pristine natural systems. Many of these regions are iconic, sustaining  tourism  and outdoor activities and providing valuable ecological services \u2013 particularly fisheries and water resources. Yet even here, the combined stress of gradual climate change and extreme weather events is causing environmental changes. These changes are often abrupt and potentially irreversible. They include wildlife and plant population collapses, the local extinction of native species, the loss of ancient, highly diverse ecosystems and the creation of previously unseen ecological communities invaded by new plants and animals. Australia\u2019s average temperature (both air and sea) has increased by about 1C since the start of the 19th century. We are now experiencing longer, more frequent and more intense heatwaves, more extreme fire weather and longer fire seasons, changes to rainfall seasonality, and  droughts  that may be historically unusual. The interval between these events has also shortened, which means even ecosystems adapted to extremes and high natural variability are struggling. As climate change accelerates, the magnitude and frequency of extreme events is expected to continue increasing. Gradual climate change can be thought of as an ongoing \u201cpress\u201d, on which the \u201cpulse\u201d of extreme events are now superimposed. In combination, \u201cpresses\u201d and \u201cpulses\u201d are more likely to push systems to collapse. We identified ecosystems across Australia that have recently experienced catastrophic changes, including: Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Of these six case studies, only the Murray River forest had previously experienced substantial human disturbance. The others have had negligible exposure to stressors, highlighting that undisturbed systems are not necessarily more resilient to climate change. The case studies provide a range of examples of how presses and pulses can interact to push an ecosystem to a \u201ctipping point\u201d. In some cases, a single extreme event may be sufficient to cause an irreversible regime shift. In other systems, a single extreme event may only be sufficient to tip the ecosystem over the edge when gradual declines in populations have already occurred. More frequent extreme events can also lead to population collapse if a species does not have enough time to recover between events. But not all examples can be directly linked to a single weather event, or a series of events. These are most likely caused by multiple interacting climate \u201cpresses\u201d and \u201cpulses\u201d. It\u2019s worth remembering that extreme biological responses do not always manifest as an impact on the dominant species. Cascading interactions can trigger ecosystem-wide responses to extreme events. Once an ecosystem goes into steep decline \u2013 with key species dying out and crucial interactions no longer possible \u2013 there are important consequences. Apart from their intrinsic worth, these areas can no longer supply fish, forest resources, or carbon storage. It may affect livestock and pasture quality, tourism, and water quality and supply. Unfortunately, the sheer number of variables \u2013 between the species and terrain in each area, and the timing and severity of extreme weather events \u2013 makes predicting ecosystem collapses essentially impossible. Targeted interventions, like the assisted recolonisation of plants and animals, reseeding an area that\u2019s suffered forest loss, and actively protecting vulnerable ecosystems from destructive bushfires, may prevent a system from collapsing, but at considerable financial cost. And as the interval between extreme events shorten, the chance of a successful intervention falls. Critically, intervention plans may need to be decided upon quickly, without full understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences. How much are we willing to risk failure and any unintended consequences of active intervention? How much do we value \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cpristine\u201d ecosystems that will increasingly depend on protection from threats like invasive plants and more frequent fires? We suspect the pervasive effects of the press and pulse of climate change means that, increasingly, the risks of doing nothing may outweigh the risks of acting. The beginning of this century has seen an unprecedented number of widespread, catastrophic biological transformations in response to extreme weather events. This constellation of unpredictable and sudden biological responses suggests that many seemingly healthy and undisturbed ecosystems are at a tipping point.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The second chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s most detailed report in seven years was published on Monday  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The world\u2019s leading authority on the  climate  crisis, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ), has published the second chapter of its most sweeping assessment in seven years. The report describes how the climate crisis is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet, and calls for urgent, transformative action to secure our future. On Monday, a 36-page summary report  was released  to the public. Here are 10 of the key takeaways. \u201cSubstantive\u201d falls in crops are projected for large swathes of Europe this century, according to the IPCC report. Though parts of northern Europe will see some gains, they will not be enough to offset the overall decline. While irrigation is an effective adaptation option for agriculture, it will be increasingly limited by water availability especially if the average global temperature rises above 3C. Coastal flood damage represents an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to communities and cultural heritage. Damage is projected to increase at least tenfold globally by 2100. However the report warns that these are conservative estimates with greater damage possible without more adaptation and mitigation.  Africa has contributed among the least to greenhouse gas emissions yet losses and damages are widespread including biodiversity loss, water shortages, reduced food production, loss of lives and hampered economic growth. In Africa, agricultural productivity growth has been reduced by 34 per cent since 1961 due to climate change, more than any other region. The climate crisis will take a heavy toll on Africa\u2019s ecosystems. Above 1.5C of warming, half of species on the continent are projected to lose more than 30 per cent of their population. At 2C, 7\u201318 per cent of species are at risk of extinction, and over 90 per cent of East African coral reefs are projected to be severely degraded by bleaching. Ukrainian scientists involved in preparing the report were unable to complete work on the final details due to Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. During a briefing on Sunday, Professor Daniela Schmidt, a IPCC lead author from the University of Bristol, made an emotional statement about the conflict. \u201cThe Ukrainian delegation has asked all of us to continue and has expressed how upset they are that this will distract from the importance of the report,\u201d Professor Schmidt said. Referring to Ukrainian invasion, she added: \u201cThe head of the Russian delegation has expressed very clearly that this is not the wish of all the Russian people, and the Russian people were not asked.\u201d On Tuesday, Russian scientists and scientific journalists published an open letter strongly protesting the attacks on Ukraine. \u201cMany of us have relatives, friends and scientific colleagues living in Ukraine. Our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought together against Nazism,\u201d they wrote. The war would turn Russia into a \u201cpariah,\u201d they noted, and that conducting scientific research would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d without international cooperation. On Sunday night at the closing session of the IPCC\u2019s two week long meeting, the head of the Ukrainian delegation spoke of the importance of building a climate-resilient future. \"Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots \u2013 fossil fuels \u2013 and our dependence on them.\" Wildfires already generate one third of ecosystem carbon emissions, but these amounts will continue to rise, causing feedback loops as further carbon is released. If temperatures rise 4C on average, wildfire frequency would rise by 30 per cent. Major impacts are occurring across many natural systems, with some experiencing or at risk of irreversible change. The Bramble Cay melomys, an endemic mammal, became extinct due to loss of habitat associated with sea-level rise and storm surges in the Torres Strait, a body of water between Australia and New Guinea. Extensive coral bleaching events and loss of temperate kelp forests have occurred, due to ocean warming and marine heatwaves. Droughts have caused financial and emotional stress in farm households and rural communities.  In mountainous areas of Asia, the IPCC describes how \u201cglacier lake outburst flood\u201d will threaten the security of local and downstream communities. Permafrost warming and increased thaw depth in built-up areas are being exacerbated by human activities. By 2050, it is likely that 69 per cent of fundamental human infrastructure in the Pan Arctic will be at risk, the report says. Despite the fact that it is \u201cunequivocal\u201d that the climate crisis is human-caused, the IPCC says, misinformation and politicization of climate science has \u201ccreated polarization in public and policy domains in North America\u201d. The authors say that this had limited climate action, and allowed vested interests to undermine science, playing down the risk and urgency.  The public\u2019s misperception of climate risks and polarized public support for climate actions is delaying urgent adaptation, the IPCC says. Furthermore, fragmented responsibility for planning, disaster management, and mitigation and adaptation actions hinders the development of policies.  More than half the global population live in cities - making them vulnerable to climate change but also the potential source of large-scale adaptation. Heatwaves, urban heat islands, extreme precipitation and storms, in combination with rapid urbanization and lack of climate sensitive planning, is affecting marginalised urban populations and key infrastructure, particularly in coastal cities. The IPCC expressed high confidence in the economic and ecological feasibility of so-called \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d, as well as sustainable urban water management, once social and political barriers. However the report warns that as global heat rises limits to adaptation will be reached in more areas for example, coastal communities, water security, agricultural production, and human health. The sixth assessment from the IPCC assessed the impacts of climate change on mental health for the first time, and was linked rising heat, trauma from extreme events, and loss of livelihoods and culture. Children, teens, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions are particularly affected.

What is his scientific expertise?\u2019 asked one climate scientist\u00a0 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile A successor has been named for the position of chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), according to reports. Dr Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at a private weather forecasting and consulting company in Atlanta, Georgia, has been tipped to take the top federal position.\u00a0 While Dr Maue acknowledges that human activities have contributed to climate change, on social media and in op-eds, he regularly criticizes \u201cclimate alarmists\" and tough policy measures to tackle the global crisis. He earned his Ph.D in meteorology at Florida State University and was previously an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, a  think-tank co-founded  by billionaire Charles Koch, who made a fortune in the  fossil fuel industry .\u00a0 The NOAA posting was first reported by the  Washington Pos t. Neither the agency nor the Department of Commerce, which oversees it, responded to a request for comment from  The Independent . The meterologist did not respond to an email seeking an interview from  The Independent . If he is confirmed after security and ethics reviews, he will replace Craig McLean, who is acting chief scientist at NOAA. The role is consequential, at one of the country\u2019s leading government climate research agencies. The chief scientist oversees climate issues but also water, satellites and modeling. \u00a0Weather is another issue on the agenda - where he brings expertise in tropical cyclones and hurricanes. However climate scientists expressed concerns that the political appointment would \u201cadvance the agenda of climate deniers\u201d in an administration which has been notoriously anti-science and rolled back dozens of climate and environmental rules. Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn State and National Academy of Sciences member, told  The Independent:  \"At a time when we are witnessing the devastating impacts of climate change-amplified extreme weather events, including wildfires out west and a record hurricane season here back east, it would have previously seemed unimaginable that an administration would appoint an individual with a record of denying and downplaying these impacts to a position of leadership at the very agency tasked with assessing the risks we face from extreme weather events. Dr Maue penned an  op-ed  for the  Wall Street Journal  in 2018 with Patrick J. Michaels, a member of the CO2 Coalition, \u00a0a pro-fossil fuel nonprofit with close ties to the Trump administration.\u00a0 In the piece, they claimed that testimony given by NASA climate scientist James Hansen, who warned a Senate committee more than 30 years ago about the dangers of climate change, had not borne out in reality. \u201cOn the 30th anniversary of Mr. Hansen\u2019s galvanizing testimony, it\u2019s time to acknowledge that the rapid warming he predicted isn\u2019t happening. Climate researchers and policy makers should adopt the more modest forecasts that are consistent with observed temperatures,\u201d Maue and Michaels wrote in the  WSJ . \u201cThat would be a lukewarm policy, consistent with a lukewarming planet.\u201d However Dr Hansen\u2019s projections, which have faced  peer review,  have stood up. And according to the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Special Report, major policy shifts must be made this decade to curb global warming to 1.5C as beyond which, scientists believe, many changes to earth systems will be irreversible. Dr Maue has also shown that he\u2019s not afraid to wade into politics on social media (although a number of tweets now appear to have been deleted from his Twitter feed but are still available in cache mode).\u00a0 He  tweeted  last week: \u201cBiden hits Trump on climate: Western fires foreshadow 'unending barrage of tragedies' Shameless but it's their political strategy to blame Trump for all natural disasters past, present, and future.\u201d But he\u2019s also shared critiques, albeit more measured, of President Trump. Last year, Mr Trump displayed a forecast map for Hurricane Dorian with what appeared to be a hand-drawn, half-circle that extended the cone of uncertainty over a swath of Alabama after Mr Trump erroneously tweeted that the storm would \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d in the state. Following the bizarre incident, now known as \u201cSharpiegate\u201d, Dr Maue told  AP  that it was important for the president\u2019s tweets to be accurate if he wants to provide helpful information to the public facing a potential emergency.\u00a0 He said the problem with the president\u2019s tweet came from sending out stale information. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to be a provider of up-to-date information, he needs to be up to date,\u201d he said.

Myron Ebell, a former environmental adviser to  Donald Trump  known for depicting  global warming  as a hoax, was interviewed by  Newsnight  presenter Evan Davis after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned humanity must make \u201cunprecedented changes\u201d to the way we live, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions almost in half by 2030. Last month the BBC has  previously admitted  it got climate change coverage \u201cwrong too often\u201d, advising its journalists they \u201cdo not need to include outright deniers\u201d in discussions because scientists accept man-made global warming is a fact. In April,  Ofcom rebuked the broadcaster  for failing to sufficiently challenge inaccuracies during an interview with climate change denier Nigel Lawson on Radio 4\u2019s  Today .  Newsnight \u2018s invitation to Mr Ebell, director of environmental policy at libertarian thinktank the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), prompted accusations the BBC had failed to learn from previous mistakes. \u201cThis is someone who thinks scientific consensus is some sort of bizarre conspiracy,\u201d Rachel Kennerley, a climate campaign officer for Friends of the Earth, told  The Independent . \u201cGiving him prominent air time is contemptible to everyone who understands that scientific fact doesn\u2019t need to be countered by someone wanting a bit of limelight. This isn\u2019t balance, it\u2019s just bad programming.\u201d Environmental writer Mark Lynas described the interview as \u201cutterly pointless and embarrassing. Car-crash television, and a waste of time that could have been used addressing the real questions.\u201d \u201cIf you want political analysis, ask a policy analyst. If you want propaganda, ask Myron Ebell,\u201d said Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London. Responding to criticism on Twitter,  Newsnight  editor Esme Wren said: \u201cAs part of our coverage of the IPCC report on global warming we currently plan to discuss the politics of climate change and the mindset of the current US administration. \u201cIn this section it is relevant to hear from those who have advised President Trump. \u201cThe issue of false equivalence is only in play when discussing the science of climate change. This point is entirely recognised and adhered to by the programme.\u201d Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Mr Trump appointed Mr Ebell to lead his transition team for US Environmental Protection Agency in September 2016. He had left the role by the time of the president\u2019s inauguration the following January. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said Mr Ebell\u2019s brief stint working for Mr Trump did not justify his inclusion on  Newsnight . \u201cEbell has never met Trump and has never served in the Trump administration. I doubt Trump has even heard of Ebell,\u201d he said, accusing  Newsnight  of \u201cdesperately attempt[ing] to justify scraping the barrel for climate change deniers\u201d. During the five-minute interview, Mr Ebell claimed it had \u201cbecome identity politics for the left to claim there was an imminent crisis\u201d in global warming. He depicted the scientists involved in the IPCC report as \u201cclimate campaigners\u201d who he suggested had been instructed by the UN to give ominous warnings about global warming. He was repeatedly challenged by Mr Davis, who told Mr Ebell: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your argument that the science is wrong, because you don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d The conversation only briefly touched upon Mr Trump\u2019s stance on environmental issues.  Asked if he could \u201cimagine anything the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this more seriously\u201d, Mr Ebell responded: \u201cNo. I think the administration and the American people are pretty convinced that a pro-energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda.\u201d The CEI has previously received millions of pounds in funding from oil company ExxonMobil. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC does not dispute the science. We acknowledge the weight of scientific consensus around climate change and this underpins all of our reporting of the subject. \u201cThis does not mean, however, that we should never interview someone who opposes this consensus, especially if they are influential in the political debate about how to tackle climate change. There are times when it is editorially appropriate to hear from a dissenting voice.\u201d On Monday, the BBC\u2019s director-general vowed the broadcaster \u201cwon\u2019t give in to pressure to silence dissenting voices\u201d. Delivering a lecture to the Society of Editors, Tony Hall said: \u201cOur impartiality does not mean that we strike some sort of false balance \u2013 but that we reflect all contributions to a debate, and give each of them their due weight. \u201cSo, no equivalence between the climate change sceptic \u2013 and the overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion. But no exclusion of viewpoints because they\u2019re generally felt to be beyond the pale. We won\u2019t give in to pressure to silence dissenting voices \u2013 nor allow those voices to be seen as mainstream.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

This summer, alarm bells rang across much of the world as soaring temperatures and extreme weather provided a picture of what the future could look like as a result of the changing climate. Wildfires struck California and Greece, while a heatwave swept the northern hemisphere from Europe to Japan, and east Africa and India experienced heavy flooding. Scientists are now more confident than ever in linking such catastrophic events to the rising global temperatures and their impact on global weather patterns. \u201cThe knock-on effects for our regional climates and for severe weather events are beginning to emerge from the background variability of our weather,\u201d said Professor Osborn. The WMO\u2019s provisional Statement on the State of the Climate in 2018 will add the evidence informing major UN climate negotiations taking place in Poland next week. On Wednesday, the UN\u2019s environment arm warned that global commitments to cutting emissions must triple to hit the Paris agreement\u2019s 2C target, and  increase by five times  to hit the stretch target of 1.5C warming. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  warned in October  that hitting that aspirational target is still technically possible, but would require \u201cunprecedented\u201d changes to every aspect of human life. \u201cWe are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases,\u201d said WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas.  \u201cGreenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if the current trend continues, we may see temperature increases 3-5C by the end of the century.  \u201cIf we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher... It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A study by the UN\u2019s  World Meteorological Organisation  (WMO) found that the planet had entered \u201cuncharted territory\u201d as rising temperatures pose a threat to food security and crucial ecosystems. The provisional WMO State of the Global Climate 2021 report also showed that the past seven years are on track to be the seven warmest on record, based on data for the first nine months of this year. Even with a temporary cooling event, known as La Ni\u00f1a, earlier this year, 2021 is still expected to be the fifth to seventh warmest year on record, while global sea levels have risen to a new high. \u201cThe provisional WMO State of the Global Climate 2021 report draws from the latest scientific evidence to show how our planet is changing before our eyes,\u201d UN secretary-general  Antonio Guterres  said in response to the report. \u201cFrom the ocean depths to mountain tops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events, ecosystems and communities around the globe are being devastated.\u201d The report, which combines work from multiple UN agencies, national meteorological and hydrological services and scientific experts, comes as world leaders meet in  Glasgow  for the Cop26 conference to discuss climate change. Wealthy countries are under pressure to raise their ambitions for climate action to tackle the crisis over the coming years, in order to limit global temperatures rising to below 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels. \u201cScientists are clear on the facts. Now leaders need to be just as clear in their actions,\u201d Mr Guterres added. \u201cThe door is open; the solutions are there. Cop26 must be a turning point. We must act now \u2013 with ambition and solidarity \u2013 to safeguard our future and save humanity.\u201d The WMO\u2019s report warned that extreme weather events have been increasing in frequency and intensity over the last 10 years, with one UN expert warning extreme events are now \u201cthe new norm\u201d. It added that the impact of these events, along with conflicts, economic shocks and the  Covid-19  pandemic, have led to \u201ca rise in hunger and, consequently, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security\u201d. The past year has seen many parts of the  Mediterranean  experience record temperatures, often accompanied by devastating fires, along with a month\u2019s worth of rainfall in the space of hours in  China  and severe flooding in parts of  Europe  that led to dozens of casualties. Meanwhile, rain was recorded for the first time at the peak of the Greenland ice sheet and Canadian glaciers have suffered from \u201crapid melting\u201d. In response to the worsening crisis, international scientific advisers, including the UK\u2019s  Sir Patrick Vallance , have signed an open letter ahead of Cop26, arguing that \u201cthe scientific case for urgent climate action is unequivocal\u201d. \u201cThis report hammers home the message that climate change is real and present: the seas are rising, glaciers are melting, and floods and wildfires are more frequent,\u201d Sir Patrick said. \u201cAcross the world, these changes are already affecting our transport, healthcare and food systems.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must continue to conduct fundamental research to understand the range and extent of climate impacts. And we must act now to mitigate the worst effects and adapt to the changes that will still occur.  \u201cThe commitment of leaders to implement changes to limit warming to 1.5C at Cop26 will be essential to protect all of us and the planet.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised economies have contributed to global average temperatures 1C above the mid-19th century Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile In little more than 150 years, humans have reversed a 6,000-year pattern of global cooling, a major study into historic temperatures has found. A team of researchers reconstructed the global average temperature over the Holocene Epoch - the 12,000 years of Earth's history since the last Ice Age. The findings show that global cooling began around 6,500 years ago, when the long-term average global temperature topped out at around 0.7C warmer than the mid-19th century - just as the  Industrial Revolution , which had begun in Britain, began to take hold across Europe and America.  The period before industrialisation represented the lowest global temperatures since the last Ice Age, culminating in a so-called \u201clittle ice age\u201d in recent centuries, the study found. Since then, increasing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised economies have contributed to global average temperatures 1C above the mid-19th century. Northern Arizona University's School of Earth and Sustainability\u2019s Regents\u2019 professor Darrell Kaufman, lead author of the study, said: \u201cBefore  global warming , there was global cooling.\u201d \u201cPrevious work has shown convincingly that the world naturally and slowly cooled for at least 1,000 years prior to the middle of the 19th century, when the global average temperature reversed course along with the build-up of greenhouse gases.  \u201cThis study, based on a major new compilation of previously published paleoclimate data, combined with new statistical analyses, shows more confidently than ever that the millennial-scale global cooling began approximately 6,500 years ago.\u201d Earlier this year, an international group of 93 paleoclimate scientists from 23 countries - led by Professor Kaufman and his team - published the most comprehensive paleoclimate data ever compiled on the past 12,000 years, compressing 1,319 data records, based on samples taken from 679 sites globally.  At each site, researchers analysed ecological, geochemical and biophysical evidence from both marine and terrestrial archives, such as lake deposits, marine sediments, peat and glacier ice, to work out past temperature changes. Countless scientists, working around the world over many decades, conducted the basic research that contributed to the global database. Assistant research professor Michael Erb, who analysed the temperature reconstructions, said: \u201cThe rate of cooling that followed the peak warmth was subtle, only around 0.1C per 1,000 years. This cooling seems to be driven by slow cycles in the Earth's orbit, which reduced the amount of summer sunlight in the northern hemisphere, culminating in the 'Little Ice Age' of recent centuries.\u201d The average global temperature has increased by just over 1C (2F) since 1880, suggesting the global average temperature of the last decade (2010-2019) was warmer than anytime during the post-glacial period. The study\u2019s co-author, associate professor Nicholas McKay, noted that some individual decades are not resolved in the 12,000-year-long temperature reconstruction, making it difficult to compare it with any recent decade.  He said: \u201cOn the other hand, this past decade was likely cooler than what the average temperatures will be for the rest of this century and beyond, which are very likely to continue to exceed 1C above pre-industrial temperatures.\u201d Professor Kaufman added: \u201cIt's possible that the last time the sustained average global temperature was 1\u00b0C above the 19th century was prior to the last Ice Age, back around 125,000 years ago when sea level was around 20 feet higher than today.\u201d Professor Cody Routson said the study helps scientists quantify the processes causing the  climate crisis . He said: \u201cInvestigating the patterns of natural temperature changes over space and time helps us understand and quantify the processes that cause climate to change, which is important as we prepare for the full range of future climate changes due to both human and natural causes. \u201cOur future climate will largely depend on the influence of human factors, especially the build-up of greenhouse gases. However, future climate will also be influenced by natural factors, and it will be complicated by the natural variability within the climate system. Future projections of  climate change  will be improved by better accounting for both anthropogenic and natural factors.\u201d The research is published in Nature Research\u2019s journal  Scientific Data .

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Risks of increasingly unpredictable weather being ignored by some financial markets, US research says Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The huge strain caused by the  climate crisis  could cause an economic recession \u201cthe likes of which we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d a US study has warned.  The increase in prevalence of  extreme weather , bringing deadly  heatwaves , more severe storms, and causing  wildfires  and  floods , is insufficiently accounted for in financial markets, raising the possibility of a sudden correction when serious problems arise, according to new research from  University of California . \u201cIf the market doesn\u2019t do a better job of accounting for climate, we could have a recession \u2013 the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Paul Griffin, an accounting professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management. The research found there was an overabundance of \u201cunpriced risk\u201d in the energy market \u2013 representing a failure to take into account factors which could have significant impacts on the future value of a business. In the US, this is because oil refining operations on the Gulf Coast are exposed to the threat of storms and sea-level rise, while other oil refineries in Northern California are exposed to coastal flooding. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Exposure to such risks can be reduced by taking out suitable insurance policies, but as the various hazards posed by climate breakdown are rapidly intensifying, it is not clear insurance companies will have the capacity to fill the gap, the research suggests. \u201cUnpriced risk was the main cause of the Great Recession in 2007-2008,\u201d Professor Griffin said.  \u201cRight now, energy companies shoulder much of that risk. The market needs to better assess risk, and factor a risk of extreme weather into securities prices,\u201d he said. The research linked the excessive high temperatures, like those experienced in the US and Europe in summer 2019, with a swathe of economic impacts. Such heatwaves can be deadly, can disrupt agriculture, can harm human health and stunt economic growth.  They also can overwhelm and shut down vast parts of vital energy infrastructure. This was the case in northern California when Pacific Gas & Electric shut down delivery during fires and weather that could trigger fire. Energy companies\u2019 transmission infrastructure is often located in arid areas, increasing risk of damage, such as the destruction caused by wildfires in California. Water delivery and transportation routes and services are also threatened by extreme weather, which then impact businesses, families, entire cities and regions \u2013 sometimes permanently, the study said. All of this strains local, and eventually, broader economies. \u201cDespite these obvious risks, investors and asset managers have been conspicuously slow to connect physical climate risk to company market valuations,\u201d Professor Griffin said. \u201cLoss of property is what grabs all the headlines, but how are businesses coping? Threats to businesses could disrupt the entire economic system.\u201d In addition to the uncertainties over the level of cover insurers can offer, Professor Griffin said \u201clitigation, sanctions and even loss of business from the property destroyed\u201d should also be considered risks in relation to the changing climate. \u201cThe climate litigation risk already priced into energy stocks would prove insufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile proprietary climate risk models may help some firms and organisations better understand future conditions attributable to climate change, extreme weather risk is still highly problematic from an estimation standpoint. \u201cThis is because with climate change, the patterns of the past are no guide to the future, whether it be one year, five years or 20 years out. Investors may also normalise extreme weather impacts over time, discounting their future importance.\u201d The paper Energy Finance Must Account for Extreme Weather Risk is published  in the journal  Nature Energy .

Details on the decision were obtained in advance by The Associated Press and expected to be announced formally on Thursday.  A federal judge four years ago had blocked an attempt to withdraw protections that were first proposed in 2010, pointing to evidence from government scientists that wolverines were \u201csquarely in the path of  climate change  \" But years of additional research suggest the animals' prevalence is expanding, not contracting, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials said. And they predict that enough snow will persist at high elevations for wolverines to den in mountain snowfields each spring despite warming temperatures. Wildlife advocates said they are likely to challenge the move in court. \u201cThey are putting the wolverine on the path to extinction,\" said Andrea Zaccardi with the Center for Biological Diversity. Wolverines  also known as \u201cmountain devils,\u201d were wiped out across most of the U.S. by the 1930s following unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns. They're slowly clawing their way back in some areas, said Justin Shoemaker, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service. Government biologists no longer consider the relatively few wolverines in the Lower 48 states to be an isolated population, instead saying they are linked to a much larger population in Canada \u201cWolverines have come back down from Canada and they are repopulating these areas in the Lower 48 that they historically occupied,\" Shoemaker said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be significant areas of snow pack in the spring at the time they would need it and the levels they would need it.\"  Wildlife officials have previously estimated that 250 to 300 wolverines survive in remote areas of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington state. The animals in recent years also have been documented in California, Utah, Colorado and Oregon. A newly released government assessment of the species status does not provide an updated population estimate. The animals need immense expanses of wild land to survive, with home ranges for adult male wolverines covering as much as 610 square miles (1,580 square kilometers), according to a study in central Idaho. Wildlife advocates have sought since the early 1990s to protect the animals and alleged political meddling in the government's decision-making process thwarted those efforts. Tim Preso with the environmental law firm Earthjustice said the latest decision fits in with a pattern of the Trump administration downplaying the threat of climate change. Agency officials rejected the notion of any interference in their scientific deliberations. \u201cThis was an analysis that was done by the scientists in the field looking at the best available information,\u201d said Jodi Bush, Montana project leader for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ___ Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @MatthewBrownAP Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Despite pledges made under the  Paris Agreement  to combat climate change, concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide all surged by higher amounts in 2018 than average for the past decade. Levels of CO2 \u2013 the main gas driving global warming \u2013 reached new highs of 407.8 parts per million (ppm) in 2018, up from 405.5ppm the previous year, a report by the UN body shows. This concentration is now 47 per cent higher than before the Industrial Revolution began in 1760, when CO2 levels were around 280ppm. \u201cWe need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,\u201d said WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images The last time Earth experienced comparable concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was three to five million years ago, when temperatures were 2C to 3C warmer and sea levels were 10-20 metres higher than today, Mr Taalas said. Human activity is increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which are driving up these gases\u2019 concentration in the atmosphere, where they have a warming effect on the Earth\u2019s climate.  Since 1990, there has been a 43 per cent increase in this warming effect by long-lived greenhouse gases, the report said.  According to the report, CO2 contributes towards 66 per cent of this warming effect, with methane at 17 per cent, and nitrous oxide at six per cent. The report focuses on concentration levels \u2013 which represent what remains in the atmosphere after a complex system of interactions between the atmosphere, land, trees and oceans.  Trees and oceans each absorb roughly a quarter of the total emissions, but this effect  is already slowing down  in the latter   as   they grow  increasingly warmer . In addition, global greenhouse gas emissions rose again in 2018 at the fastest rate in seven years, according to a  preliminary report  by the Global Carbon Project. The resultant heating of the planet is driving impacts such as melting glaciers and sea level rise, more extreme droughts, heatwaves and storms, also posing a threat to food security, water supplies and wildlife. If our current emissions trends continue unchecked, many researchers predict mass displacement on an unprecedented scale. Large swathes of North Africa and the Middle East would likely become uninhabitable due to scorching heat and drought, with sea level rises affecting many of the world\u2019s most populous cities. The WMO warned that despite agreements made under the Paris Agreement, global emissions are not estimated to peak by 2030, let alone by the 2020 date that scientists have said is necessary to curb dangerous  climate change . \u201cThe findings ... point us in a clear direction \u2013 in this critical period, the world must deliver concrete, stepped-up action on emissions,\u201d said the UN Environment Programme\u2019s executive director Inger Andersen. \u201cWe face a stark choice: set in motion the radical transformations we need now, or face the consequences of a planet radically altered by climate change.\u201d Additional reporting by PA Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Even under the unrealistic \"best-case\" scenario of 1.5C of warming by 2100, many millions of people will have to choose between starvation and migration,  Philip Alston , the  UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights  warned. He predicted a split between those able to mitigate the worst effects of the warming planet and those with no means to avoid it, calling it a \"climate apartheid\".  And he said the fallout from our rapidly warming climate would have dire implications for human rights and democracy. \"What was once considered catastrophic warming now seems like a best-case scenario,\" Mr Alston said.

The poorest half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.5 billion people \u2013 is responsible for just 10 per cent of carbon emissions, while the richest 10 per cent are responsible for around half of greenhouse gases.  And a person in the wealthiest 1 per cent uses 175 times more carbon than one in the bottom 10 per cent, an Oxfam report from 2015 found. There have been some positive developments, with renewable energy prices falling, coal becoming uncompetitive, emissions declining in 49 countries, and 7,000 cities, 245 regions, and 6,000 companies committing to climate mitigation. However, despite ending its reliance on coal,  China  \u2013 the world's biggest polluter \u2013 is still exporting coal-fired power plants and is failing to crack down on its own methane emissions. Meanwhile  Brazil 's  Jair Bolsonaro  plans to open up the Amazon rainforest for mining, end demarcation of indigenous lands, and weaken environmental protection. Donald Trump has blamed other nations for the crisis despite the US being the world's second biggest polluter.  \u201cChina, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water, and the sense of pollution. If you go to certain cities \u2026 you can\u2019t even breathe, and now that air is going up \u2026 They don\u2019t do the responsibility,\" he said in an interview earlier in June. Mr Alston also criticised the \"patently inadequate\" steps taken by UN human rights bodies to address the climate crisis, saying the \"incremental\" progress was \"entirely disproportionate to the urgency and magnitude of the threat\". \"Ticking boxes will not save humanity or the planet from impending disaster,\" he concluded.

Dr Kyle Merritt, responsible for the diagnosis of the senior citizen from Nelson in  British Columbia  who suffered from  asthma , said this was the first time in a decade that he wrote climate change as a cause of suffering.  \u201cIf we\u2019re not looking at the underlying cause, and we\u2019re just treating the symptoms, we\u2019re just gonna keep falling further and further behind,\u201d the emergency room doctor told the  Glacier Media . \u201cIt\u2019s me trying to just... process what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he adds.  In June  Canada  suffered from a historic heatwave, followed by a thick smog season triggered by wildfires.  British Columbia, the westernmost province of Canada, saw record-breaking temperatures in June, which experts believe led to the death of over 500 people. The wildfires caused the air quality to become 43 times worse than levels acceptable as safe throughout July and August.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the emergency department, we look after everybody, from the most privileged to the most vulnerable, from cradle to grave, we see everybody. And it\u2019s hard to see people, especially the most vulnerable people in our society, being affected. It\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Dr Merritt told the outlet.  The patient, who was in her seventies, was diagnosed in the summer soon after the heatwave that Dr Merritt says directly contributed to making her ailment worse.  \u201cShe has diabetes. She has some heart failure .\u2026 She lives in a trailer with no air conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of her health problems have all been worsened. And she\u2019s really struggling to stay hydrated.\u201d The diagnosis from Dr Merritt has led to other doctors in the province launching an initiative called Doctors and Nurses for Planetary Health. Healthcare professionals are using the group to advocate for better health by protecting the environment, they said on the website. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the climate crisis and its impact on health,\u201d the group\u2019s website said. \u201cThis summer, our patients experienced extreme weather events of heat dome, drought, and severe wildfires.\u201d The extreme weather in Canada is one in a series of problems the world faced due to climate change as extreme flooding, drought, fires and heatwaves dominated the headlines. World leaders at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow have been pushing for stricter climate action targets to prevent more extreme impacts in the coming years and the pledges have reduced the projected emissions below 2C for the first time.  However, climate experts have warned this isn\u2019t enough.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in As water supplies\u00a0run low in South African city, analysis by local scientists suggests global warming will make such \u2018freak\u2019 events commonplace in years to come Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Cape Town is in the  grip of a drought  widely regarded as the worst in recorded history \u2013 one that could see it become the first city in the world to run out of water. The city is edging closer to a day \u2013 known locally as  \u201cDay Zero\u201d  \u2013 when supplies are so low authorities will have to cut off water to three quarters of the population.  Far from being a hypothetical scenario, Day Zero has a set date. It is currently expected on 9 July. The perfect storm of conditions that led to this drought, specifically three consecutive years of extremely low rainfall, would generally be expected no more than once in a millennium.  Predicting such \u201cfreak\u201d events is tricky for scientists, but one thing is clear: climate change appears to have played a significant role in the Cape\u2019s current misfortune, and it is set to make such events far more likely in the years to come. Scientists have long suspected climate change has  a hand in natural disasters  such as droughts, flooding and hurricanes.  However, until relatively recently they have lacked sufficient data to support these suspicions. While the link between a warming world and increased incidence of droughts may seem obvious, even here the complexity of the natural systems involved mean it can be difficult to draw direct links. But in the Cape, where a cycle of wet and dry years is the natural course of things, there is evidence that global warming has caused the usual dry spell to intensify significantly. \u201cThe effects of global warming are now interwoven with this natural variability,\u201d says Professor Mark New, a climate researcher at the University of Cape Town. Climate change contributes to drought both by changing rain levels and temperature. \u201cDroughts are a natural phenomenon in the Western Cape and the effect of climate changes is that it magnifies all weather events \u2013 both drought and flooding \u2013 and makes them less easy to predict,\u201d says Dr Piotr Wolski, a hydrologist in the climate system analysis group at the University of Cape Town. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions while the disaster is still ongoing, \u201ctentative preliminary analysis\u201d by Professor New suggests that the once-in-a-millennium dry spell Cape Town is currently experiencing was made five times more likely by global warming. What this means is that the 1C rise in average temperature over the past century in the region has increased the likelihood of such an event fivefold, compared to a scenario in which this warming had not taken place. Across southern Africa more broadly, a 2016 analysis found that a slight shift towards lower rainfall in the region resulting from climate change is \u201clikely\u201d. And while Cape Town may be the first city to run out of water due to climate change, experts predict it will not be the last.  Major hubs, including Mexico City, Sao Paulo and even London, could all be at risk of running out of water if rainfall is too low and sufficient preparatory measures are not taken. According to the UN, climate change, population growth and consumption will likely result in two-thirds of the entire global population facing a lack of sufficient water resources by 2025. As the Western Cape is expected to warm by around 0.25C over the next decade, the likelihood of drought there is expected to increase sevenfold.  Global warming will inevitably lead to extreme conditions becoming the new normal, and the scientists stress the importance of adaptation to this new reality. \u201cOne positive outcome of the drought is that the general population has a better understanding of the linkages between climate and day-to-day life as well as an improved saving mentality and awareness of the value of water,\u201d says Dr Wolski. As the water crisis has increased in severity over the past two years, Cape Town has introduced ever more restrictive measures to bring down water use. Demand has been reduced from 1,200 million litres a day in 2015 to less than 600 million litres today. Current restrictions in Cape Town require residents to use less than 50 litres of water each per day \u2013 compared to more than 300 litres used every day by the average American. Meanwhile, work now must begin on long-term measures such as desalination plants that can keep the city adequately supplied with water during future droughts. \u201cOn the supply side, the drought has accelerated research and investment into alternative water sources that will assist in making the system more resilient in the medium to long term,\u201d says Dr Wolski. Though the predictions made by climate change attribution scientists seem bleak, they do serve to transform the conversation about natural disasters. Soenke Kreft, leader of Munich Climate Insurance Initiative at the United Nations University, has described attribution science as an important area of research with \u201cpotential to transform public narratives into more specific prevention measures of risks\u201d. While mitigation strategies can work as a sticking plaster for problems like droughts, they do not address the root of the problem \u2013 namely greenhouse gas emissions. The worst predictions made about future droughts, in which the Mediterranean, south-west US and southern Africa begin to dry up by the end of the century, are all based on scenarios where carbon dioxide emissions do not fall. By making the mental link between emissions and real-world outcomes such as droughts, scientists hope that both the public and policymakers can be convinced to take action.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Dealing with the climate crisis is hard for even the wealthiest countries. What happens if massive debt and a pandemic cause financial chaos as well?  Somini Sengupta  investigates Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile A flooded street in Coban, Guatemala, following a tropical storm H ow does a country deal with climate disasters when it is drowning in debt? Not very well, it turns out. Especially not when a global  pandemic  clobbers its  economy . Take Belize, Fiji and Mozambique. Vastly different countries, they are among dozens of nations at the crossroads of two mounting global crises that are drawing the attention of international financial institutions:  climate change  and debt. They owe staggering amounts of  money  to various foreign lenders. They face staggering climate risks, too. And now, with the coronavirus pandemic pummeling their economies, there is a growing recognition that their debt obligations stand in the way of meeting the immediate needs of their people \u2013 not to mention the investments required to protect them from climate disasters. Read More: The combination of debt, climate change and environmental degradation \u201crepresents a systemic risk to the global economy that may trigger a cycle that depresses revenues, increases spending and exacerbates climate and nature vulnerabilities,\u201d according to a new assessment by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and others, which was seen by  The New York Times . It comes after months of pressure from academics and advocates for lenders to address this problem. The bank and the IMF, whose top officials are meeting this week, are planning talks in the next few months with debtor countries, creditors, advocates and ratings agencies to figure out how to make new money available for what they call a green economic recovery. The goal is to come up with concrete proposals before the international climate talks in November and ultimately to get buy-in from the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, including China, which is the largest single creditor country in the world. We should be compensated for suffering the excesses of others and supported in mitigating and adapting to climate change effects Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, says that green recovery programmes have the potential to spur ambitious climate action in developing countries, \u201cespecially at a time they face fiscal constraints because of the impact of the pandemic on their economies\u201d. One of the countries at the crossroads of the climate and debt crises is Belize, a middle-income country on the Caribbean coast of central America. Its foreign debt had been steadily rising for the last few years. It was also feeling some of the most acute effects of climate change: sea-level rise, bleached corals, coastal erosion. The pandemic has dried up tourism, a mainstay of its economy. Then, after two hurricanes, Eta and Iota, hit neighbouring Guatemala, floods swept away farms and roads downstream in Belize. Today, the debt that Belize owes its foreign creditors is equal to 85 per cent of its entire national economy. The private credit ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s has downgraded its creditworthiness, making it tougher to get loans on the private market. The IMF calls its debt levels \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Belize, says Christopher Coye, the country\u2019s minister of state for finance, needs immediate debt relief to deal with the effects of global warming that it had little role in creating. \u201cHow do we pursue climate action?\u201d he says. \u201cWe are fiscally constrained at this point. We should be compensated for suffering the excesses of others and supported in mitigating and adapting to climate change effects \u2013 certainly in the form of debt relief and concessionary funding.\u201d Many Caribbean countries like Belize do not qualify for low-interest loans that poorer countries are eligible for. The United Nations said on 31 March that the global economic collapse endangered nearly $600bn (\u00a3436bn) in debt service payments over the next five years. Both the World Bank and the IMF are important lenders, but so are rich countries, as well as private banks and bondholders. The global financial system would face a huge problem if countries faced with shrinking economies defaulted on their debts. The World Bank and the IMF are planning crucial talks in the next few months \u201cWe cannot walk head on, eyes wide open, into a debt crisis that is foreseeable and preventable,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said last week as he called for debt relief for a broad range of countries. \u201cMany developing countries face financing constraints that mean they cannot invest in recovery and resilience.\u201d The Biden administration, in an executive order on climate change, says it will use its voice in international financial institutions, like the World Bank, to align debt relief with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, though it has not yet detailed what that means. The discussions around debt and climate are likely to intensify in the run-up to the climate talks in November, where money is expected to be one of the main sticking points. Rich nations are nowhere close to delivering the promised $100bn (\u00a373bn) a year to help poorer countries deal with the effects of global warming. Low- and middle-income countries alone owed $8.1 trillion (\u00a36 trillion) to foreign lenders in 2019, the most recent year for which the data is available \u2013 and that was before the pandemic. At the time, half of all countries that the World Bank classified as low-income were either in what it called \u201cdebt distress or at a high risk of it\u201d. Many of those are also acutely vulnerable to climate change, including more frequent droughts, stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels that wash away coastlines. (The fund says that it will not require 28 of the world\u2019s poorest countries to make debt payments through October, so their governments can use the money on emergency pandemic-related relief.) Lately, there\u2019s been a flurry of proposals from economists, advocates and others to address the problem. The details vary. But they all call, in one way or another, for rich countries and private creditors to offer debt relief, so countries can use those funds to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to the effects of climate change, or obtain financial reward for the natural assets they already protect, like forests and wetlands. One widely circulated proposal calls on the Group of 20 (the world\u2019s 20 biggest economies) to require lenders to offer relief \u201cin exchange for a commitment to use some of the newfound fiscal space for a green and inclusive recovery\u201d. A village in Guatemala following heavy rains caused by Hurricane Eta On the other side of the world from Belize, the low-lying Pacific island nation of Fiji has experienced a succession of storms in recent years that brought destruction and the need to borrow money to rebuild. The pandemic brought an economic downturn. In December, tropical cyclone Yasa destroyed homes and crops. Fiji\u2019s debts soared, including to China, and the country, whose very existence is threatened by sea-level rise, pared back planned climate projects, according to research by the World Resources Institute. The authors proposed what they called a climate-health-debt swap, where bilateral creditors, namely China, would forgive some of the debt in exchange for climate and health care investments. (China has said nothing publicly about the idea of debt swaps.) And then there\u2019s Mozambique \u2013 the sixth-poorest country in the world. It was already sinking under huge debts, including secret loans that the government had not disclosed, when, in 2019, came back-to-back cyclones. They killed 1,000 people and left physical damages costing more than $870m. Mozambique took on more loans to cope. Then came the pandemic. The IMF says the country is in debt distress. Six countries on the continent are in debt distress, and many more have seen their credit ratings downgraded by private ratings agencies. In March, finance ministers from across Africa said that many of their countries had spent a sizeable chunk of their budgets already to deal with extreme weather events like droughts and floods, and some countries were spending a tenth of their budgets on climate adaptation efforts. Read More: \u201cOur fiscal buffers are now truly depleted,\u201d they wrote. In developing countries, the share of government revenues that go into paying foreign debts nearly tripled to 17.4 per cent from 2011 to 2020, an analysis by Eurodad, a debt relief advocacy group, found. Research suggests that climate risks have already made it more expensive for developing countries to borrow money. The problem is projected to get worse. A recent paper found climate change will raise the cost of borrowing for many more countries as early as 2030 unless efforts are made to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a9 The New York Times Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

His promise could come to be a defining moment in the global climate crisis: the first time that China, the  world \u2019s largest emitter, pledged to stop adding to the global warming that is pushing the planet towards irreversible catastrophe. \u201cIt\u2019s profoundly significant that the leader of the largest country in the world, and also the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has set an end to the age of oil, coal and gas,\u201d former California governor Jerry Brown, chair of the California-China Climate Institute, told  The Independent . \"This is a marker for other nations to consider, and try to not only emulate but go beyond.\u201d Xi\u2019s remarks seemed particularly well-calculated coming minutes after President Trump\u2019s speech where he slammed China\u2019s environmental record, and called for the UN \"to hold them accountable\" for the Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 Mr Trump also claimed that the US has reduced its carbon emissions by more than any other signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. ( Climate Action Tracker , an independent scientific analysis which tracks government efforts on the Paris deal, found that the US is \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d when it comes to emissions reductions.) The US, like other large polluters India, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Australia, has set no emissions goal. Mr Trump, who has called  climate change  \u201ca hoax\u201d, is set to withdraw from the Paris deal if he wins re-election this November. With China, 30 countries now have varying carbon neutrality pledges \u2013 meaning the release of no additional carbon into the atmosphere. In total, it accounts for roughly 43 per cent of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Xi's carbon pledge also spun some positive publicity for China at a time of growing international outrage over the severe restriction of civil rights in Hong Kong, following Beijing\u2019s sweeping national security law on the semi-autonomous city, and widespread accusations of mass detentions and cultural genocide of Muslims in the Xinjiang region. In the past, China has argued that as a developing economy, it should not be beholden to the same reduction commitments as developed nations, like the US, UK and European states, whose decades of rampant polluting drove global warming in the 20th century.   But international pressure has been building on China which pledged under the 2016 Paris agreement to have its emissions peak around 2030. Leaders from the EU, which is committing to carbon neutrality by 2050, urged China earlier this month to aim for 2060 or face punitive carbon tariffs. The news that China\u2019s emission levels could now slope downwards before the decade is out was cautiously welcomed by analysts. Xi offered no details on Tuesday as to how the targets would be met. Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia, described Xi\u2019s announcement as injecting \u201cmuch-needed momentum to global climate politics\u201d. But Mr Li added: \u201cXi\u2019s pledge will need to be backed up with more details and concrete implementation. By how much earlier can China peak its emissions? How to reconcile carbon neutrality with China\u2019s on-going coal expansion? \u201cThese are hard questions that demand a better response from Beijing. But if anything, Xi\u2019s new commitment will certainly help turn a challenging year for the environment around and mark as the beginning of a reinvigorated round of global climate efforts.\u201d How China ultimately decides to fight the climate crisis will have global impact.  The country released the equivalent of 10 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the US and three times as much as the EU. China burns about half the coal used globally each year. Between 2000 and 2018, its annual carbon emissions nearly tripled, and it accounts for roughly almost a third of the world\u2019s total.\u00a0 Satellite images and media reports suggest new coal power plants are under construction, with total capacity of 148 gigawatts \u2013 nearly equal to the entire coal-power capacity of the EU, according to non-profit Global Energy Monitor. The country has also faced an economic slowdown, missing a recent growth target earlier this year,  Bloomberg  noted, and putting energy conservation on the back burner.\u00a0 On the flipside, China is also the leading market for solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, and it manufactures about two-thirds of solar cells installed around the world. It is the largest financier of energy infrastructure globally. Richard Black, director of non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told  The Independent  that China could achieve Xi's pledges by simply accelerating a lot of what it\u2019s already doing \u2013 ramping up production of electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, solar panels, and the build rate of nuclear reactors (the latter of which will likely spark an international debate around safety). He also projected rollouts of charging points for EVs and expansion of the train network countrywide. \u201cI think we also will see interesting investment in steel manufacture,\u201d he added. \"There is development on making steel using zero carbon methods in Europe but for China to do it would be an absolute game-changer. Not only for steel but aluminium, cement, all the heavy industries.\u201d Governor Brown said that to hit Xi\u2019s stated goals, then \u201cnumber one is to get off coal as soon as possible\u201d.  He echoed the sentiment on increasing EV production, saying that if China did so, \"Europe, Germany particularly, and the United States better wake up\u201d.  \u201cTo do what the world needs, Xi will accelerate production of the electric and hydrogen car. And as soon as he does that, Europe and America must respond at an equal or greater level. At this moment that does not appear likely,\u201d he added. If China does fulfil the ambitious targets, it could prevent 0.4-0.7F (0.2 to 0.4C) further warming for the world, according to \u201cvery rough estimates\u201d MIT management professor John Sterman, who models and tracks emission reductions and pledges with Climate Interactive, told  The Associated Press .\u00a0 Professor Sterman said that he was particularly enthused by the effort to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 \u2013 instead of by 2030. The gas stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, so earlier emission cuts are more effective than promises in the future, he said. \u201cEmissions that don\u2019t happen between now and 2030 are going to reduce warming a lot more than the same emission reductions after 2060,\u201d the professor said.  While the pledges offer a glimmer of hope to the international climate community, China also serves to benefit at home by cutting emissions. China is in a constant battle with poor air quality in many large urban areas, while the country's densely populated and environmentally fragile coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and temperatures. Flooding this year in the Yangtze River has killed hundreds of people and displaced millions in central and southwestern China, and hampered efforts to kickstart economies following Covid-19 lockdowns. There is hope that Xi\u2019s speech will build momentum leading up to the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, next year in the UK after it was delayed by the pandemic. It also follows a number of years of missed climate goals and increasingly devastating impacts from climate change including heightened wildfires, soaring heatwaves and more severe typhoons, monsoons, hurricanes and droughts.  \u201cIf China comes out with a concrete, long-term strategy to the international community, that would be massive to increasing confidence in the international process which has not been at its highest ebb for the last few years,\u201d Mr Black said. \"Perhaps more importantly, just the sheer economic muscle of China would change the behaviour of economic markets and investors. If they are convinced that China is heading in this direction, it will change decision-making, moving away from fossil fuels and towards clean technology.\u201d Former Democratic Governor Brown said he was optimistic, adding that Xi\u2019s pledge had laid down the gauntlet for other nations on how they were going to ramp up tackling the climate crisis.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a positive step and if it's accompanied by the election of Joe Biden, then America will rejoin the Paris Agreement and nations will start figuring out faster how to reduce [emissions] in precise numbers,\u201d he said. \"The beauty of Xi\u2019s goal is it puts numbers on the table and invites others to go much faster and much further. The next moves should come from the United States and the European Union.\u201d  Additional wire reporting Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Winter temperatures could rise by as much as 9.1C while mass-melting would see the size of the permafrost drop by a quarter under the most extreme scenario considered feasible by scientists. This would open up pristine areas of  Russia  east of the Ural Mountains, paving the way for millions of people to relocate to the region, which stretches from northern Kazakhstan to the Bering Sea. Modelling for a less extreme rise in atmospheric carbon still resulted in temperature increases of up 3.4C in the winter months. Under this projection, scientists estimated there would be a five-fold increase in the capacity of the territory to sustain human populations. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Researchers said the speed with which humans could move to Siberia would depend on investments in infrastructure, as the region was currently poorly served. For their analysis, the team from Russia\u2019s Krasnoyarsk Federal Research Centre and the US National Institute of Aerospace looked at two possible scenarios for how concentrations of CO2 may rise in the coming decades. One, termed representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, represented \u201cmild\u201d climate change, while RCP 8.5 represented more extreme changes. The two trajectories are accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as being at the lower and upper ranges for  greenhouse gas emissions : RCP 2.6 assumes global emissions will peak by 2020, with emissions declining substantially thereafter; whereas under the RCP 8.5 scenario, emissions will continue to rise throughout the 21st century. Dr Elena Parfenova, lead author of the study, which was published in  Environmental Research Letters , said: \u201cWe found increases in temperature of 3.4C (RCP 2.6) to 9.1C (RCP 8.5) in mid-winter; increases of 1.9C (RCP 2.6) to 5.7C (RCP 8.5) in mid-summer; and increases in precipitation of 60mm (RCP 2.6) to 140 mm (RCP 8.5).\u201d Under the group\u2019s worst case simulations, permafrost coverage in Russia\u2019s far east would decrease from the current level of 65 per cent to 40 per cent by the 2080s. At 13 million square kilometres, Russia\u2019s Asian territory accounts for about 77 per cent of the country\u2019s total land area, but around just 27 per cent of its population, much of which is concentrated along the forest-steppe in the south. But Dr Parfenova said this was likely to change: \u201cAsian Russia is currently extremely cold. In a future warmer climate, food security in terms of crop distribution and production capability is likely to become more favourable for people to support settlements.\u201d She added: \u201cHowever, suitable land development depends on the authorities\u2019 social, political and economic policies. \u201cVast tracts of Siberia and the far east have poorly developed infrastructure. The speed these developments happen depends on investments in infrastructure and agriculture, which in turn depends on the decisions that should be made soon.\u201d Vladimir Chuprov, of Greenpeace Russia, said there were a number of factors triggered by a warming Siberia that would complicate efforts to increase the human population there. \u201cPermafrost degrading would mean that at any area with dominating swamps or wetlands, it will be impossible to build infrastructure\u201d in the short term, he told  The Independent.  He added that \u201chigher temperatures will provoke more insects, which is bad for agriculture\u201d.

In order to find out more about how children feel about  climate change ,  BBC Newsround  conducted a survey of 2,000 eight to 16-year-olds. The poll showed that young people are feeling frustrated and anxious about the state of the planet with 80 per cent saying the problem of climate change was important to them, and more than a third saying it was very important. Nearly three quarters (73 per cent) added that they were worried about the state of the planet right now, including 22 per cent who say they were \u201cvery worried\u201d.  When asked about their futures, almost three in five (58 per cent) children said that they are concerned about the impact that climate change will have on their lives, with many admitting these worries often come out in unusual ways.  Nearly one in five (19 per cent) of the children surveyed admitted to having a bad dream about the climate crisis, while 17 per cent said they have had their sleeping and eating habits affected by their concerns. When questioned about the action being taken by grown-ups to tackle the problem, a large number of children said they feel frustrated about the progress being made.  More than half (59 per cent) of participants said they don't think their voices are being heard on climate change, while nearly two thirds (64 per cent) don't believe people in power are listening to them enough when they do talk about it.

REUTERS\/Go Nakamura If you grab your fishing pole and head to a river in  Montana \u2019s  Rocky Mountains , you may easily make a catch. But thanks to human-caused  climate  change, that  fish  is more likely to be a nonnative species. A study in Science Advances shows that Montana\u2019s changing climate is causing native  trout  to dwindle - and facilitating the rise of invasive species. The scientists analysed 30 years\u2019 worth of data from trout surveys in streams and rivers in Montana\u2019s Rocky Mountains. Since trout are sensitive to climate conditions, they are a kind of bellwether for their ecosystem. Climate change endangers all kinds of trout, and nearly half of their habitat has declined in the West in recent years. But warming waters have a silver lining for some invasive species introduced by fisheries for recreational fishing. The nonnative trout can often better adapt - and outcompete native species. The researchers found that the amount of stream occupied by native bull trout declined 18 percent between 1993 and 2018, and predict their stream occupancy will decrease another 39 percent in the next six decades. Westslope cutthroat trout, another native species, declined 6 percent over the study period, and will probably decline another 16 percent by 2080. The reasons behind the declines were different for each species. The bull trout were possibly threatened most by rising water temperature and decreases in the summer stream flow. Westslope cutthroat trout were likely victims of invasive species - especially rainbow trout - that thrived in the warmer waters. \"Species-specific climate adaptation strategies may be needed for conservation of freshwater biodiversity,\" the authors write. The researchers expected to see the declines. But one anomaly surprised them. They project that cutthroat trout can actually expand their stream occupancy despite climate change - but only in the absence of nonnative species. Montana has already lost some populations of native fish species that thrive in cold water, says study co-author and University of Montana associate professor Andrew Whiteley in a news release.  \"This is particularly troubling in a state where cold-water fisheries now contribute nearly $650 million a year to our economy,\" he says. \"But all is not lost for these economically, ecologically and culturally important species as long as appropriate conservation action is taken.\" The Washington Post Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

By 2038, the university aims to achieve what is known as \u201cnet zero\u201d greenhouse gas emissions across its entire portfolio, meaning none of the businesses it invests in generate more emissions than they capture.  \u201cWe will be measuring emissions from the activities of every investment in everything from food to transport to energy and manufacturing, across asset classes, and working to reduce them progressively over the period with an aim to reach zero by 2038,\u201d the university's chief investment officer, Tilly Franklin, said. \u201cThe aim is to build an investment portfolio which is reflective of a future net zero economy.\u201d The British government has set a net zero target for the country as a whole by 2050. Cambridge University  has long been a place of learning for the elite, counting royalty, such as Prince Charles and his son William, famous scientists such as Charles Darwin and Rosalind Franklin, broadcaster David Attenborough and actor Tilda Swinton among its alumni. Its endowment fund is one of the biggest for a European university, though it is dwarfed by those held by some American institutions. Dozens of U.S. universities have committed to divesting themselves of at least some fossil fuel assets. The University of California announced in May that it completed the process of purging its $126-billion portfolio of such investments in favor of renewable energy. One motivation for Cambridge University's move may be its location. Founded some 800 years ago, Cambridge lies about 6 meters (20 feet) above sea level, making the risk of flooding significantly greater the more oceans rise as a result of global warming. ___ Follow  AP  s climate coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/climate Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

I would not say that I have firm views on it,\u2019 Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, said this week Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Amy Coney Barrett  insisted this week that she would bring no personal agenda to the  Supreme Court , instead deciding cases \u201c as they come \u201d. For around 20 hours, Judge Barrett gave a carefully-worded  performance  before the  Senate Judiciary committee  declining, like  nominees  before her, to reveal her personal views. And yet in a key moment on Wednesday she appeared to do precisely that: refusing to say that  climate change  is scientific fact, but rather \u201ca very contentious matter of public  debate \u201d, during questioning by committee member and Democratic VP nominee Senator  Kamala Harris . \u201cI will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial,\u201d  Judge Barrett said . \u201cYou know, I\u201dm certainly not a scientist,\u201d she said a day earlier. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve read things about climate change. I would not say that I have firm views on it.\u201d Her words alarmed environmentalists and brought condemnation from  scientists  who have l ong-established the facts  that human-caused carbon emissions are heating the planet.\u00a0 Greta Thunberg, climate activist,  tweeted : \u201cTo be fair, I don\u2019t have any \u2018views on climate change\u2019 either. Just like I don\u2019t have any \u2018views\u2019 on gravity, the fact that the earth is round, photosynthesis nor evolution. \u201cBut understanding and knowing their existence really makes life in the 21st century so much easier.\u201d Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the  Center for Biological Diversity , said: \"It is a typical conservative, right-wing view that scientific reality is something that you can have an opinion about.\" Despite a  slim judicial record  on environmental issues, Judge Barrett's remarks illuminate how such cases might fare in the land\u2019s highest court, on the verge of a 6-3 conservative majority. \u201cI think it's likely to be a court that is significantly more hostile to environmental regulation, even more than the current court,\u201d \u00a0Professor Ann Carlson, faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law told  The Independent . Scientists say that we have around a decade to make meaningful cuts to emissions and bring climate change under control, or the planet will face even more severe impacts than we are already witnessing. Robert Percival, director of the environmental law programme at the University of Maryland, told  Grist  that \u201cenvironmentalists are facing a real minefield ahead\u201d. \u00a0 How might the 48-year-old Judge Barrett's lifetime Supreme Court appointment shape the US\u2019s ability to tackle climate change in the crucial decades to come, and what paths to meaningful action remain? 'No standing' for public interest groups, states To bring a case before the Supreme Court, the plaintiff must have \"standing\u201d or in other words, have suffered injury. It was a ruling by the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Judge Barrett will replace, that opened the door for environmental groups and states to seek justice on environmental issues, and not be dismissed before reaching the highest court. In 2000, Justice Ginsburg wrote that Friends of the Earth had \u201cstanding\u201d against Laidlaw Environmental Services because of their \u201creasonable concerns\u201d about industrial pollution.  \u201cJustice Ginsburg wrote a tour de force in that opinion,\u201d Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus told  PRI , saying that she laid the foundation for  Massachusetts v Environmental Protection Agency , widely seen as the most significant environmental case ever to reach the Supreme Court. The landmark case was won 12 states and a handful of cities after the court ruled that it was the government\u2019s responsibility to address climate pollution. But it was a narrow victory, 5-4, and only one of the justices in the majority still sits on the court.\u00a0 On the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, where Judge Barrett was appointed in 2017 after President Trump\u2019s nomination, she has taken a narrow view of who can bring cases over environmental damages, \u201cwriting the majority opinion in at least two cases denying opponents standing in court\u201d, the  Washington Post  reported. Additionally, having a case reach the Supreme Court has X-Factor-like odds: only about 1 per cent of roughly 8,000 cases submitted each year. They are selected by a \u201cRule of Four\u201d justices but with the court tipped largely right, it could have serious implications as to which ones even make it through the doors. As Judge Barrett has said that she has no \u201cfirm views\u201d on climate change, it is hard for some to imagine how she would be convinced that a case involving the issue should be taken up by the court. Mr Hartl said: \u201cIf [Judge Barrett] doesn\u2019t believe that people are actually injured by climate change, cases like  Massachusetts v EPA  will be lost before you even get to the merits. The court will not be open to hearing those sorts of cases in the first place. That\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d Making it harder for states and environmental groups to go to court in the first place, Mr Hartl says, means \"giving additional power to other sorts of groups, like corporations\". If President Trump wins re-election, he will likely continue  dismantling environmental rules  and policies. If environmental groups and states lose the opportunity to sue, there would be little to stop the rollbacks. Shutting down executive action and stifling agencies If elected, Joe Biden has promised a  $2trillion plan  to tackle climate change and a \"demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year\u201d to ensure net-zero emissions by 2050. \u00a0But a Senate that remains in Republican control suggests little hope of passing that sweeping agenda. Professor Carlson points to the Clean Air Act (CCA) as a next best option but this is far from without pitfalls and would \u201cinvariably invoke a challenge\u201d. \"The current composition of the court already threatens EPA authority to regulate GHGs aggressively under the Clean Air Act,\u201d she said, noting that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, has previously been extremely sceptical that the act even covers emissions. \u201cKavanaugh takes on increasing importance, particularly on environmental questions. I think he becomes the centre of a very conservative court,\u201d Prof. Carlson said. \u201cEverything I can tell about Amy Coney Barrett is that she is cut out of the same Federalist Society cloth. Her answers on climate change in the past two days were signals.\" She added that, in her opinion, \u201cthe addition of Judge Barrett pretty much guarantees that any attempt by EPA, without some congressional action, to aggressively regulate (GHG) emissions is going to be struck down.\u201d The Federalist Society is a conservative organisation advocating for a \u201ctextualist\u201d or originalist interpretation of the US Constitution, which Judge Barrett adheres to. At the hearing, she explained that \"I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time people ratified it,\" Barrett said. \"So that meaning doesn\u2019t change over time and it\u2019s not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it.\u201d Mr Hartl noted: \u201cAt the end of the day, originalism and textualism are really just a very narrow view on progress. It\u2019s basically saying the people who wrote the Constitution back in an era when there wasn\u2019t even electricity should forever lock us into our views and our government.\" In his opinion, Mr Hartl said, textualism \"is a convenient excuse to accomplish a goal that is ideological\u201d. Of major concern, Prof Carlson says, is a little-known legal theory called the \u201cnon-delegation doctrine\u201d, which has lain dormant since the 1930s New Deal-era, but which all five conservative justices have expressed interest in reviving. Judge Barrett has also indicated support for the doctrine in  writings . The theory holds that Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to administrative agencies, and laws can be quashed if they seem to be designated too much power. For example, while the Supreme Court ruled in favour of EPA plans to regulate GHG emissions from industry back in 2014, the  agency itself admitted  that the Clean Air Act, established in the 1960s, doesn\u2019t easily lend itself to regulating CO2. In the past, Congress has tended to paint in broad brushstrokes like with the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. Prof Carlson noted that the Supreme Court could make the argument that because \"Congress hasn\u2019t spoken about GHGs in the Clean Air Act, even though it covers air pollutants very broadly, it is therefore an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to agency\u201d. She added: \u201cIf Congress cannot delegate power to administrative agencies to implement statutes, it could really destroy a whole apparatus that grew up in the post-war era.\u201d If November brings a blue wave and Democrats become the Senate majority, there is more chance of Congress passing legislation to limit emissions and it being on \"firmer ground in the Supreme Court\u201d. But Prof Carlson added that \"Congress will need to be careful about the non-delegation doctrine\u201d and pass a law that is \u201cvery clear and direct\u201d, to prevent a court striking it down. Paths for climate action While passing a climate bill in Congress is the best chance of success, it\u2019s not the only option. \u201cIn theory, laws on the books are still on the books,\u201d Mr Hartl said. \u201cAnd Congress is free to pass additional legislation. There are still lots of tools to address climate and environmental problems even in a world with a 6-3 conservative majority. \u201cThe challenge is to find legal action that is less at the fringe and not push the boundaries when you have a court that is hostile to boundaries.\u201d  Prof Carlson said that it remains to be seen how far the court moves to the right. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts  has joined with the liberal wing  in some recent rulings but with such a tip in the court, his power is diluted. And then there\u2019s the question of whether Democrats will add more seats to the court, something  Mr Biden and Sen Harris  have been coy about. \u201cThere\u2019s so many moving parts,\u201d Prof Carlson said. Mr Hartl noted that Democrats have been \u201ca little bit naive\u201d compared to how Republicans have approached the courts. A  study this year  found that the GOP has been laser-focused in its strategy of packing supreme courts at state level too. In 2014, after President Obama\u2019s climate change law was blocked by Congress, he pivoted to the EPA, creating the Clean Power Plan which set the first-ever limits on power plants, the largest source of carbon pollution in the US. The standard set by  Massachusetts v EPA  means it should have succeeded. \u00a0But around two dozen, largely Republican leaning states sued to block it, a move that was backed by the Supreme Court. The regulation withered until the end of Obama\u2019s presidency and President Trump replaced it with a  watered-down version . Mr Hartl said the Clean Power Plan has suffered from Democrats\u2019 ultimately flawed calculus that industry and Republicans \"wouldn\u2019t fight to the death and litigate\u201d. \u201cIndustry fought everything that Obama did as if it were the worst thing ever,\u201d Mr Hartl said. Making meaningful environmental progress \u201dwill require a change in thinking about how to anticipate what the court will do\". He added: \"Frankly because of the likely challenge to standing, it\u2019s going to be harder for the advocacy groups and states.\u00a0 \"So it\u2019s going to be incumbent upon a potential Biden administration to do the right thing from the outset, even if it\u2019s politically difficult.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The village of Lytton, in the interior of southern British Columbia, saw the mercury hit 46.6C on Sunday \u2013 an all-time high in the country\u2019s 84-year-old record, officials said. The previous national record was 45C, which was set in Yellow Grass and Midale in Saskatchewan in July 1937. More than 40 other places in British Columbia also set new records, according to the Canadian weather agency. Officials warned temperatures could continue to rise this week.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile President Joe Biden\u2019s  time in the White House could have significant impact on the  climate crisis  and give the world a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures in check, scientists say. The president\u2019s  climate plan  is the boldest in US history, proposing a $2 trillion investment in clean energy to create carbon-free electricity by 2035. Mr Biden rejoined the  2015 Paris Climate Agreement on Inauguration Day.  Leaders around the world heralded the return of the US to the international pact to limit global heating to well below 2C. So what exactly has Mr Biden said about the climate crisis and how extensive are his plans to tackle further global heating? The president has repeatedly called climate change an \u201cexistential threat\u201d and linked its impacts to burdens on the most vulnerable Americans.\u00a0 While speaking about the unprecedented California wildfires in September 2020, Mr Biden called it the \u201cundeniable, accelerating, and punishing reality of climate change and its impact on our planet and our people \u2014 on lives and livelihoods\u2026\" He continued: \u201cThe unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. But too often the brunt falls disproportionately on communities of colour, exacerbating the need for environmental justice.\" He also framed climate change as an opportunity in the style of an FDR-like New Deal, providing infrastructure jobs across the country. He tweeted last year: \u201cWhen Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks \u2018hoax\u2019. \u00a0 I think \u2018jobs\u2019. \u00a0Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation.\u201d Mr Biden has sweeping plans for a nationwide mobilisation to reduce emissions, build and retrofit infrastructure, create new jobs and advance social justice. \u00a0 It involves $2 trillion investment in clean energy over four years, aiming for 100 per cent clean electricity by 2035.\u00a0 Senior campaign officials, who spoke anonymously to\u00a0the AP, said it would be paid for through a mix of tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, and deficit spending aimed at stimulating the economy. It\u2019s a plan that evolved during the campaign to take into account the view of progressives, like senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that Mr Biden needed to commit to more sweeping and urgent action on the crisis.\u00a0 His campaign platform described the Green New Deal as a \u201ccrucial framework\u201d but didn\u2019t go as far as the ambitious proposal that calls for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2030. He said that he would ban new gas and oil permits, including for fracking, on federal lands. (However fracking operations are largely on private lands.) The Biden climate plan places heavy emphasis on updating America\u2019s infrastructure. It advocates for investments to improve energy efficiency in buildings and housing; promote production of electric vehicles and increase conservation efforts in the agriculture industry. It also focuses on environmental justice with a requirement that 40 per cent of spending on clean energy deployment, reduction of legacy pollution and other investments go to historically disadvantaged communities. On his first day in office, Mr Biden recommitted the US to the Paris Agreement. His administration intends to lead an international effort to have every major country commit to greater emission-reduction targets. Experts point to  Mr Biden\u2019s decades of foreign policy experience as an attribute for driving the epic international cooperation that will be needed to fully tackle the climate crisis.\u00a0 In the mid-eighties, when Nasa scientist James Hansen testified before Congress on the greenhouse effect, then-senator Biden introduced the Global Climate Protection Act. It eventually led to talks between president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, committing to \"broad international and bilateral cooperation in the increasingly important area of global climate and environmental change\". In 1992, Mr Biden criticised president George HW Bush for not pushing countries to provide targets or timetables to reduce emissions,  Inside Climate News  reported, as he cast his vote to ratify the UN framework convention treaty on climate change. But as a senator, Mr Biden also supported controversial fracking and \u201cso-called clean coal\u201d, the  Council on Foreign Relations  noted. Mr Biden has pointed to the achievements of the Obama era including tightened fuel-efficiency standards (although they were later watered down by Donald Trump). There was also $90bn for clean energy in the 2009 stimulus package, which as vice president he played an  instrumental role  in negotiating. The Obama years were also when the Paris Agreement was struck.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Mr Trump said his focus was saving American jobs, while taking credit for some of the \u201ccleanest air and water the nation has seen in generations\" \u2014 partly down to regulations passed in the Obama era.\u00a0 The president then pivoted to an attack on clean energy, taking  particular issue with windmills , falsely stating they \u201ckill all the birds\u201d and saying \"the fumes coming up, if you\u2019re a believer in carbon emission \u2026 for these massive windmills is more than anything we\u2019re talking about with natural gas which is very clean\u201d. Mr Biden spoke of a transition from the oil industry to renewable, clean energy which Mr Trump immediately jumped upon, asking voters in Texas and Pennsylvania if they were listening. The former vice president also made the case for his plan that tackling climate change will create good-paying jobs - an issue of particular importance to his base. He called for massive investment to create new environmentally-friendly industries.\u00a0 The Independent  asked some of the country\u2019s leading climate scientists, policy experts and environmentalists for their takeaways from the climate change portion of the debate. Michael Mann, \u00a0Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and member of the \u00a0US National Academy of Sciences : \"Tonight's debate highlighted the starkest contrast imaginable between the two candidates when it comes to the defining challenge of our time.\r\n \u201cOn the one hand you have Donald Trump who denies the climate threat and has sought to sabotage both domestic and international efforts to act, and on the other hand you have Joe Biden who has put forward a bold climate plan, recognising the win-win scenario of a clean energy economy that promises jobs and a hospitable plant for us and future generations.\u201d Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media and co-founder of grassroots movement, 350.org : \u00a0\"The fact that environmental justice came up in tonight's debate is a testament to how far this movement has come over the last year.\u00a0 \u201cClimate is no longer just an environmental issue, it's about justice, jobs, and our public health. Biden clearly understands this. He spoke passionately about the impacts of pollution and how a clean energy economy could create opportunities for all. Trump, meanwhile, is still stuck in an alternate universe, spouting off nonsense about climate change being a hoax and acting as if fracking is somehow going to save our economy.\u201d Drew McConville, Senior Managing Director of Government Relations for The Wilderness Society Action Fund:  \u201cDespite President Trump\u2019s claims of environmental heroism, nobody\u2019s buying it. \u00a0It\u2019s no secret that his Administration and fossil fuel industry engineered a full retreat on climate action, the gutting of health and environmental standards, and the auctioning of America\u2019s most valuable public lands. In contrast, Vice President Biden has fought for clean energy and environmental protections, and he has committed to bold, science-based action for tackling the climate and nature crises as President.\u201d \u00a0Andr\u00e9s Jimenez, Executive Director of Green 2.0, an advocacy group to increase racial diversity among environmental organisations:  \"Americans deserved a more substantive debate than what they saw tonight. The frontline communities who bear the brunt of our country's inaction on climate change \u2013 overwhelmingly Black, brown and indigenous \u2013 deserve a much more robust conversation about the consequences of our federal government's lack of a comprehensive plan to address the climate crisis. It also calls for a fact-based discussion about how each candidate's plan will affect job growth in the energy sector and in those frontline communities.\" Gernot Wagner, climate economist at NYU and a founding executive director of Harvard\u2019s Solar Geoengineering Research Program : \"Joe Biden came out swinging, and he hit a home-run, emphasising how his ambitious climate plan has the support of both the environmental and labor communities, addressing justice concerns, and leading to higher economic growth. Win-win-win-win. \"The more fundamental bit, of course, is that Joe Biden has a climate plan, while Donald Trump does not, other than to dismantle existing environmental protections. In fact, climate is part of several of Biden's plans, on justice, foreign policy, and economic policy more broadly.\" Greenpeace USA Climate Campaigner Ashley Thomson : \u201cThe differences between Joe Biden and Donald Trump are wider on climate than perhaps any other issue. Trump has fuelled the climate crisis at every turn, selling out working people and families in order to let corporate polluters wreak havoc.\u00a0 \"It was painfully clear on the debate stage that Trump does not have a plan. His attacks on the Green New Deal and the integrity of the election only reinforce one thing \u2014 he knows he\u2019s losing. Climate denial is not a victimless crime, and voters are ready to hold the perpetrators accountable at the ballot box in this election.\" 350 Action North America Director Tamara Toles O\u2019Laughlin : \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that climate is a top issue for voters. At tonight\u2019s final debate, Joe Biden demonstrated the capacity for leadership our country needs and deserves, including tackling the climate crisis at scale. He doubled down on stopping fossil fuel subsidies, re-joining the Paris agreement, and creating millions of good, green jobs. We are committed to holding a Biden administration accountable to stop fracking and protect our communities.\u00a0 \"Black, Indigenous, and communities of colour continue to bear the brunt of Donald Trump and his fossil fuel lies. It\u2019s time for a just transition for workers across the industry. The planet can\u2019t take four more years of Trump\u2019s deadly mismanagement and plain incompetence.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The dire warning at the UN General Assembly came from leaders in all corners of the world: In island nations where they are at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels to central Africa where temperature increases are expected to be 1.5 times higher than the world average. The annual meeting of world leaders is taking place largely virtually this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Along with the global health criss, ministers pointed to the increasing red alerts from nature. \u201cWe are already seeing a version of environmental Armageddon,\u201d Fiji\u2019s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said, citing wildfires in the American west and noting that the Greenland ice chunk was larger than a number of island nations. This was meant to be the year \u201cwe took back our planet,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Instead, the coronavirus has diverted resources and attention from what could have been the marquee issue at this UN gathering. Meanwhile, the UN global climate summit has been postponed to late 2021. That hasn\u2019t stopped countries, from slowly sinking island nations to parched African ones, from speaking out. \u201cIn another 75 years, many ... members may no longer hold seats at the United Nations if the world continues on its present course,\u201d the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries Group said. In 2015, the majority of nations signed the Paris Climate Accord with the aim to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C (3.6F) above the pre-industrial age. However climate scientists say that with current global trends, the planet is on track to soar past that. A new study found that if the world warms another 0.9C (1.6F), the West Antarctic ice sheet will reach a point of irreversible melting. It has enough water to raise global sea levels by 5 metres (16 feet). The Pacific island nation of Palau hasn\u2019t had a single COVID-19 infection, but President Tommy E. Remengesau Jr warns it\u2019s the rising seas that will bring the country down. \u201cThe momentary drop in (carbon) emissions this year cannot be allowed to generate any complacency about global progress,\u201d he said, referring to the sparkling skies that followed lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus around the world. Pollution has crept back up as restrictions ease. World powers cannot shirk their financial commitments to fighting climate change during the pandemic, Remengesau said, even as economies are battered. But few pledges have emerged at the UN gathering, aside from China\u2019s announcement that it aims to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The pandemic has muted the UN meeting, with world leaders speaking not from the podium in New York but via video from home. That has sapped the urgency of diplomacy and left nations wondering just how many people are listening. Amid concerns that the world is distracted, it was perhaps no surprise that the student-led movement Fridays for Future returned to the streets this week for the first major demonstrations for climate action in months. Still, island nations have seized on the unusual circumstances to show off what\u2019s at stake. The prime minister of Tuvalu, Kausea Natano, delivered his UN speech with a vista of turquoise waters and swaying fronds behind him that instantly fired the imaginations of house-bound viewers. But the prime minister quickly shattered any dreams. While Tuvalu is free of the coronavirus, the pandemic struck as the island nation was recovering from a pair of tropical cyclones \u2014 storms that scientists say are likely to become wetter as the planet warms. Tuvalu\u2019s highest point is just a few meters (yards) above sea level. The pandemic\u2019s effect on the movement of goods exposed food insecurity as local agriculture becomes more difficult with rising sea levels, Natano said. \u201cWhile COVID-19 is our immediate crisis, climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the Pacific and its peoples in the long run,\u201d the prime minister said. From the Marshall Islands, also free of Covid-19, President David Kabua used the virus\u2019s example to plead for more help now. \u201cChange relies on protecting the most vulnerable, because those on the frontline \u2013 whether healthcare workers battling the pandemic or small island nations sounding the alarm on climate change \u2013 are critical to the survival of us all,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall island and atoll nations like mine do not have time for paper promises,\u201d Kabua added. Urgent pleas also came from Africa, which contributes least to global warming but stands to suffer from it the most. \u201cIn favoring solutions based on the respect for nature, we\u2019re also preserving the health of our peoples,\u201d said President Issoufou Mahamadou of Niger, part of the Sahel region south of the Sahara desert where temperature increases are expected to be 1.5 times higher than the world average. \u201cOur global home that was teeming with millions of species of God-given creatures, both great and small, is slowly dying,\u201d said Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who last year noted that his country was the only one in Africa to reach the goal of making renewable energy 75% of its energy mix. He added: \u201cOur world is yearning for us to stop its ruin.\u201d Associated Press Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Reappraisal of the models climate scientists use to determine future warming has revealed that less optimistic estimates are more realistic. The results suggest that the  Paris Climate Agreement , which aims to keep global average temperatures from rising by 2C, may be overly ambitious. \u201cOur study indicates that if emissions follow a commonly used business-as-usual scenario, there is a 93 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 4C by the end of this century,\u201d said Dr Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science, who co-authored the new study. This likelihood is an increase on past estimates, which placed it at 62 per cent. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Climate models are vital tools for scientists attempting to understand the impacts of greenhouse-gas emissions. They are constructed using fundamental knowledge of physics and the world\u2019s climate. But the climate system is incredibly complex, and as a result there is disagreement about how best to model key aspects of it. This means scientists have produced dozens of climate models predicting a range of different global warming outcomes resulting from greenhouse-gas emissions. Based on a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario in which emissions continue at the same rate, climate models range in their predictions from a 3.2C increase in global temperatures to a 5.9C increase The new study,  published in the journal  Nature , sought to resolve this situation and establish whether the upper or lower estimates are more accurate. To do this, Dr Caldeira and his collaborator Dr Patrick Brown reasoned that the most accurate models would be the ones that were best at simulating climate patterns in the recent past. \u201cIt makes sense that the models that do the best job at simulating today\u2019s observations might be the models with the most reliable predictions,\u201d said Dr Caldeira. Their conclusion was that models with higher estimates were more likely to be accurate, with the most likely degree of warming 0.5C higher than previous best estimates.  Other climate scientists have responded favourably to the new research. \u201cThere have been many previous studies trying to compare climate models with measurements of past surface-temperature, but these have not proved very conclusive in reducing the uncertainty in the range of future temperature projections,\u201d said Professor William Collins, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who was not involved in the study. According to Professor Collins, this work \u201cbreaks the issue down into the fundamental building blocks of climate change\u201d. The research by Dr Brown and Dr Caldeira focuses specifically on models of energy flow from Earth to space, as measured by  satellites .  They suggest that the amount of sunlight reflected away from the planet by clouds will decrease as the world gets warmer, increasing the magnitude of climate change. \u201cSo we are now more certain about the future climate, but the bad news is that it will be warmer than we thought,\u201d said Professor Collins. According to Professor Mark Maslin, a climatologist at University College London who was not involved in the study, these results could mean \u201ccutting carbon emissions deeper and faster than previously thought\u201d. \u201cTo achieve these targets the climate negotiations must ensure that the global emissions-cuts start as planned in 2020 and continue every single year thereafter,\u201d said Professor Maslin. However, experts also warn that there is need for caution when predicting such complex phenomena as climate change. \u201cThis is only one line of evidence,\u201d said Professor Piers Forster, a climate-change specialist at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the study. \u201cOther lines of evidence based on the historically observed warming suggest the simulations with slightly cooler projections may fit best. We need to consider all the lines of evidence before we jump to conclusions.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

But one thing isn\u2019t up for debate: the  evidence for climate change  is unequivocal. We still control the future, however, as the magnitude of shifting weather patterns and the frequency of extreme climate events depends on how much more greenhouse gas we emit. We aren\u2019t facing the end of the world as envisaged by many environmentalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but if we do nothing to mitigate climate change then billions of people will suffer. Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit some of the heat radiation given off by the Earth\u2019s surface and warm the lower atmosphere. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapour, followed by carbon dioxide and methane, and without their warming presence in the atmosphere the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be approximately -20\u00b0C. While many of these gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, humans are responsible for increasing their concentration through burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other land use changes. Records of air bubbles in ancient Antarctic ice show us that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are now at their highest concentrations for more than  800,000 years .     The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents six main lines of  evidence for climate change . We have tracked the unprecedented recent increase in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  since the beginning of the industrial revolution . We know from laboratory and atmospheric measurements that such greenhouse gases do indeed absorb heat when they are present in the atmosphere. We have tracked significant increase in global temperatures of at least 0.85\u00b0C and a sea level rise of 20cm  over the past century . We have analysed the effects of natural events such as sunspots and volcanic eruptions on the climate, and though these are essential to understand the pattern of temperature changes over the past 150 years, they cannot explain the overall warming trend. We have observed significant changes in the Earth\u2019s climate system including reduced snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere, retreat of sea ice in the Arctic, retreating glaciers on all continents, and shrinking of the area covered by permafrost and the increasing depth of its active layer. All of which are consistent with a warming global climate. We continually track global weather and have seen significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events all around the world. Patterns of precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) have changed, with parts of North and South America, Europe and northern and central Asia becoming wetter, while the Sahel region of central Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia have become drier. Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding. We\u2019re also seeing more heat waves. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) between 1880 and the beginning of 2014, the 19 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 20 years; and 2015 is set to be the  warmest year ever recorded . EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA The continued burning of fossil fuels will inevitably lead to further climate warming. The complexity of the climate system is such that the extent of this warming is difficult to predict, particularly as the largest unknown is how much greenhouse gas we keep emitting. The IPCC has developed a range of emissions scenarios or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to examine the possible range of future climate change. Using scenarios ranging from business-as-usual to strong longer-term managed decline in emissions, the climate model projections suggest the global mean surface temperature could rise by between 2.8\u00b0C and 5.4\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. Even if all the current country pledges submitted to the Paris conference are achieved we would still only just be at the bottom end of this range.     The sea level is projected to rise by between 52cm and 98cm  by 2100 , threatening coastal cities, low-lying deltas and small island nations. Snow cover and sea ice are projected to continue to reduce, and some models suggest that the Arctic could be ice-free in late summer by the latter part of the 21st century. Heat waves, droughts, extreme rain and flash flood risks are projected to increase, threatening ecosystems and human settlements, health and security. One major worry is that increased heat and humidity could make physical work outside impossible.     Changes in precipitation are also expected to vary from place to place. In the high-latitude regions (central and northern regions of Europe, Asia and North America) the year-round average precipitation is projected to increase, while in most sub-tropical land regions it is projected to decrease by as much as 20%, increasing the risk of drought. In many other parts of the world, species and ecosystems may experience climatic conditions at the limits of their optimal or tolerable ranges or beyond. Human land use conversion for food, fuel, fibre and fodder, combined with targeted hunting and harvesting, has resulted in  species extinctions  some 100 to 1000 times higher than background rates. Climate change will only speed things up. This is the challenge our world leaders face. To keep global temperature rise below the agreed 2\u00b0C, global carbon emission must peak in the next decade and from 2070 onward must be negative: we must start sucking out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Despite 30 years of climate change negotiations there has been no deviation in greenhouse gas emissions from the business-as-usual pathway, so many feel keeping global warming to less than 2\u00b0C will prove impossible. Previous failures, most notably at Copenhagen in 2009, set back meaningful global cuts in emissions by at least a decade. Paris, however, offers a glimmer of hope.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Life on Earth has already been fundamentally altered by  global warming , affecting the genes of plants and animals and altering every ecosystem on the planet, according to a major review of the scientific literature. A  paper in the leading journal Science  warned the changes were so dramatic \u2013 and potentially dangerous \u2013 that scientists might be forced to intervene in some cases to create \u201chuman-assisted evolution\u201d. One of the main concerns about climate change is it will seriously damage food production, particularly in places prone to flooding and drought, leading to mass famines and the forced migration of climate refugees. The researchers found that 82 per cent of the natural ecological processes that support healthy ecosystems on land and sea had been affected in a way that had not been expected \u201cfor decades\u201d. The average global temperature has risen by one degree Celsius since the 1880s, as humans have pumped greenhouse gases from fossil fuels into the atmosphere. The researchers said this had \u201calready had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems, with accumulating consequences for people\u201d. \u201cMinimising the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations,\u201d they wrote in the paper. \u201cIt is now up to national governments to make good on the promises they made in Paris [at last year's climate summit] through regular tightening of emission targets, and also to recognise the importance of healthy ecosystems in times of unprecedented change.  \u201cTime is running out for a globally synchronised response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\u201d Many species are shifting towards the poles as the world has warms, while others are seeking higher ground. Marine species have expanded into areas that were usually too cold at a rate of 72km per decade, while land species have done so at 6km per decade, the paper said. Alamy Alamy Alamy Other creatures are changing shape, with many getting smaller as a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio makes it easier to stay cool.  For example, six species of woodland salamander in the Appalachian Mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past 50 years. Slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans, but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food. \u201cSome fish species appear to be shrinking, but attributing this solely to ocean warming is difficult because size-dependent responses can be triggered by commercial fishing as well as long-term climate change,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cHowever, long-term trend analyses show convincingly that eight commercial fish species in the North Sea underwent simultaneous reductions in body size over a 40-year period because of ocean warming, resulting in 23 per cent lower yields.\u201d Changes are also taking place on a much bigger scale.  In Alaska, the researchers said \u201cwholesale biome shifts\u201d had been observed with the \u201ctundra \u2026 transitioning to boreal conditions\u201d.  \u201cThese are clear signs of large-scale ecosystem change and disruption, in which disequilibrium rapidly pushes the system into a new state,\u201d they wrote. And such ecological regime shifts can have dire results. \u201cFor example, some reefs are transitioning from coral- to algal-dominated states as a consequence of mass coral mortality, whereas kelp forests are turning into rocky barrens in temperate seas,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cIn lakes, climate change has increased the risk of regime shifts from clear-water to turbid states and increased the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms.\u201d All this turmoil is likely to be too much for some forms of life. For example, some trees do not reproduce fast enough to shift their range uphill to escape the warming climate. The researchers suggested humans might have to step in to help nature. \u201cOne such strategy is to use assisted gene flow, the managed movement of individuals or gametes between populations to mitigate local maladaptation in the short and long term,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cHuman-assisted evolution may \u2026 be a key strategy in maintaining reef dependent fisheries by accelerating and enhancing the stress tolerance of corals.\u201d The researchers pointed to declines in the yields of significant food crops, such as rich, maize and coffee, \u201cin response to the combined effects of rising temperatures and increasing precipitation variability over past decades\u201d.  \u201cGenetics is being used to counteract decreasing yields in some key crops such as wheat (for which, globally, yields have declined by six per cent since the early 1980s) through crossing domesticated crops with wild relatives to maintain the evolutionary potential of varieties,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYet, some important wild strains are also showing signs of impact from climate change.  \u201cLosing genetic resources in nature may undermine future development of novel crop varieties and compromise key strategies that humans use to adapt to climate change.\u201d Farmers in temperate areas are also now using a specially cultivated peach, called UFBest, which requires fewer chilly days than typical varieties after experiencing a fall in fruit quality and yield. Plagues of insect pests are also a growing problem, particularly in the forests of North America. \u201cSeveral native insect species from North America, with no prior records of severe infestation, have recently emerged as severe pathogens of forest resources because of changes in population dynamics,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThese include the Aspen leaf miner, the leafblotch miner, and the Janet\u2019s looper, which have decimated millions of hectares of aspen, willows, and spruce-fir forests since the early 1990s. \u201cKnown pests such as mountain and southern pine beetles and spruce beetles have recently expanded their distribution and infestation intensity on commercially important pine and spruce trees.  \u201cThese outbreaks may increase in the future because hundreds of plant pest and pathogen species have shifted their distributions 2 to 3.5km per year pole-ward since the 1960s.\u201d Getty PA Getty Ye et al\/Current Biology Reuters A.

One of the researchers, Professor James Watson, of Queensland University, said: \u201cSome people didn't expect this level of change for decades. \u201cThe impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere, with no ecosystem on Earth being spared. It is no longer sensible to consider climate change as a concern only for the future. \u201cEmissions targets must be actively achieved and time is running out for a synchronised global response to climate change that safeguards biodiversity and ecosystem services.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Around four-fifths of the mercury put into the atmosphere from natural and human causes, such as burning coal, ends up in the ocean. It is then converted by tiny organisms to a particularly dangerous organic form known as methylmercury.  As small creatures are eaten by larger ones, mercury becomes more concentrated up the food chain.  As the seas warm, fish like cod are using more energy to swim which requires more calories \u2013 so they are eating more and storing up more of the toxin. Methylmercury can affect brain functions in humans. Children may be especially at risk from exposure to fish-derived mercury while their brains and nervous systems are developing in the womb. Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Reuters AFP\/Getty Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Reuters Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals AFP\/Getty Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals AFP\/Getty Jo-Anne McArthur\/We Animals While regulation to curb emissions of mercury are leading to decreases in the concentrations of the toxin in fish, rising ocean temperatures due to climate change are predicted to push it up again. The researchers from Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health modelled the changes in mercury emissions. Their computer modelling predicts an increase of 1C in seawater temperatures compared to how warm it was in 2000 would lead to a 32 per cent increase in methylmercury levels in cod and a 70 per cent increase in spiny dogfish. Even with a 20 per cent decrease in methylmercury in sea water as a consequence of reductions in emissions, a 1C temperature rise would lead to increases of 10 per cent in cod and 20 per cent in spiny dogfish, the researchers said. They also analysed the effects of recent ocean warming from a low in 1969 on concentrations of the mercury in Atlantic bluefin tuna and found it could contribute to an estimated 56 per cent increase in levels in the species. Changes in the diet of species including cod and spiny dogfish as a result of overfishing of their food sources such as herring can also affect how much methylmercury they are consuming and storing in their bodies. Researchers looked at the impacts of overfishing which changes what top predators eat, such as reducing how many large herring cod are eating. Their study, based on three decades of data from fish and seawater from the Gulf of Maine is published in the journal  Nature . Concentrations of the toxin in cod increased by up to 23 per cent between the 1970s and 2000s as a result of dietary shifts initiated by overfishing and then a recovery of herring populations, scientists say. Up to 17 per 1,000 children from subsistence fishing communities in Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia and Greenland have been shown to suffer from mental impairment due to the consumption of mercury-contaminated sea food, according to the World Health Organisation. Elsie Sunderland, a senior author of the paper, said: \u201cWe have shown that the benefits of reducing mercury emissions holds, irrespective of what else is happening in the ecosystem. \u201cBut if we want to continue the trend of reducing methylmercury exposure in the future, we need a two-pronged approach. \u201cClimate change is going to exacerbate human exposure to methylmercury through seafood, so to protect ecosystems and human health we need to regulate both mercury emissions and greenhouse gases.\u201d Professor Sean Strain from University of Ulster, who was not involved in the research, said the suggestions made in the paper looked accurate. He said: \u201cThe modelling and calculations appear to be solid, based on good quality science, and would support the suggestion by the authors that these modelled potential increases in methylmercury in cod and other fish species would be owing to overfishing and global warming.\u201d However, he said the claim that a 23 per cent increase in mercury in Atlantic cod could be a threat to human health was contestable. Dr Emeir McSorley, also from Ulster University and not involved in the research, said: \u201cMothers in the Seychelles are exposed to methylmercury concentrations at least 10 to 100 times greater than fish consuming mothers in Western countries and yet we have consistently found no adverse associations of methylmercury with neurodevelopment in three mother-child cohorts. \u201cIndeed, the children born to mothers with the highest methylmercury exposures were undertaking some developmental tests better than those born to mothers exposed to lower methylmercury. We interpreted these findings as indicating that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweighed any risks.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The single-cell organism has the potential to naturally absorb carbon Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Climate Change Endangering Billions of Lives, UN Report Says Scientists have discovered a new marine microbe that could be pivotal in the fight against climate change. The tiny, single-cell organism discovered by researchers in Sydney, Australia has the capacity to naturally absorb carbon and can photosynthesise, hunt, and eat. It is plentiful in marine environments around the world. \u201cThis could be a game-changer in the way we think about carbon and the way it moves in the marine environment,\u201d the study\u2019s senior author Martina Doblin told  Newsweek . The existence of the marine microbe suggests to scientists that the ocean has a greater capacity to absorb and store carbon than is currently believed. The potentially important marine microbe in question operates by secreting a mucus-like substance called \u201cexopolymer mucosphere,\u201d rich in carbon, that then traps other microbes. After consuming some of the trapped prey, the microbe ejects the substance \u2014 which sinks back down into the ocean\u2019s carbon-cycling system. It is the potential to move carbon from the ocean\u2019s surface to deep within the ocean that could be particularly useful in regulating the climate. Researchers have estimated that the newly-discovered microbe species could sink up to 0.15 gigatons of carbon each year. This potential new species will not likely solve the world\u2019s climate problems on its own.  Scientists believe that the world needs to remove 10 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere yearly to prevent catastrophic global warming; this microbial species, at best, could help remove just over 1 percent of that goal.  But researchers are hopeful that there may be similar marine microbial species that could help with carbon sequestration as well.  \u201cThe implication is that there\u2019s potentially more carbon sinking in the ocean than we currently think and that there is perhaps greater potential for the ocean to capture more carbon naturally through this process, in places that weren\u2019t thought to be potential carbon sequestration locations,\u201d Ms Doblin told  Newsweek .

Young people from the  Youth Strike 4 Climate  movement have organised protests in more than 70 towns and cities across the UK, in their third major  demonstration  this year. Children are taking the day off school to call for the government to declare a state of climate emergency and implement a \u201c Green New Deal \u201d policy framework that would decarbonise the economy, and reduce social inequality. \u201cWe\u2019ve been angry for a long time,\u201d said Noga Levy-Rapoport, a 17-year-old student and  protest  organiser from London. \u201cPreviously, we didn\u2019t have a platform \u2013 and there was no way to express our anger. \u201cA whole generation has been ignored and now we aren\u2019t going to stop pushing for change until the government takes action.\u201d AFP\/Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images Reuters REUTERS An estimated 20,000 young people skipped school and attended protests organised by Youth Strike 4 Climate in February and in March an estimated 50,000 took to the streets. \u201cMomentum is building,\u201d said Ms Levy-Rapoport. \u201cAs the protests get bigger more people are hearing about the movement.\u201d George Bond, a 16-year-old from Devon, who is active in the UK Student Climate Network said: \u201cTo adequately address the climate crisis, we need bold and ambitious ideas that inspire people to think of a better world. A Green New Deal is one such solution. \u201cWith a promise of well-paid and secure jobs in the renewable and other green sectors, it would go a long way toward addressing the economic inequality that has disproportionately affected so many communities and regions around the UK as well as tackling climate change.\u201d He added: \u201cOver the last three months attitudes have changed dramatically. The mainstream media and politicians are only just waking up to the power that young people have and what we can achieve.\u201d The growing global youth movement to combat climate change has been galvanised by actions taken by the Swedish teenager  Greta Thunberg , who began a solo protest in Sweden last summer. She was nominated for a  Nobel Peace Prize  in March for her role in sparking climate protests in more than 100 different countries. Jake Woodier is a campaign officer with UK Student Climate Network, an organisation that provides logistical support to the children organising protests in the UK. \u201cThe children are spread out across the UK and mainly organise online,\u201d he said. \u201cNew technologies are allowing young people to organise on a global scale in a way that has never been possible in the past. This is the first generation that truly grew up with mobile technology and the internet and they are reimagining the way that it can be used.\u201d Young people active within the UK Student Climate Network mainly communicate via mobile messaging applications and video conferencing technology, he added.  Protests earlier this year have seen police intervening as roads came to a standstill, activists scaled traffic lights and statues, and some sat in front of double-decker buses. Demonstrators are also campaigning for the voices of young people to be considered when it comes to policy-making and for the voting age to be lowered to 16. Environment  Secretary Michael Gove has previously spoken of his support for strikes, saying: \"Collective action of the kind you're championing can make a difference, and a profound one.\" The latest strikes come in the wake of a  United Nations  report which warned that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires unprecedented action \u2013 including cutting global carbon dioxide emissions by almost half within 12 years. Scientists have warned that the climate impacts, such as increased risk of flooding and extreme heat, will be become more severe as global temperatures rise beyond the 1.5C target.

Nakate, who has demonstrated alongside other young activists including  Greta Thunberg  urged leaders \u201cto see the danger we are in.\u201d  Niclas Kjellstr\u00f6m-Matseke, the chairman of the Tutu Legacy Foundation, said in comments introducing the lecture that \u201cour indecisiveness expedites inequality, it enables injustice, it facilitates the destruction of critical biodiversity and it empowers the richest nation on earth to walk out on a global climate agreement and to suspend funding to the World Health Organization during a global pandemic.\" He was referring to President Donald Trump's announcement in 2017 that the U.S. would withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, and the decision this year to remove U.S. funding for the WHO in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide. Thunberg was due to speak alongside Nakate but withdrew last week without giving a reason. She was replaced by Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and a key figure in the 2015 Paris climate accord.  The Tutu peace lecture is given every year to coincide with the South African Nobel Peace Prize winner's birthday. Tutu turned 89 on Wednesday. The pre-recorded speeches, not given in person this year because of the pandemic, called for \u201cclimate justice globally.\u201d \u201cThe destruction of the Earth\u2019s environment is the human rights challenge of our time,\u201d said Tutu, the former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town who was awarded the Nobel for his fight against South Africa's racist system of apartheid, which ended in 1994. The speakers called on the world to reduce the burning of fossil fuels and cut emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.  The main goal of the Paris climate accord is to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, but scientists say the world is on track to soar past that. Nakate's speech focused on the African continent, which contributes the least to climate change but stands to suffer its effects the most. She said flooding and drought have destroyed crops and caused hunger for millions, while flooding has increased the prevalence of deadly diseases like malaria and cholera, and conflicts can arise when resources are diminished.  \u201cClimate change is a nightmare that affects every sector of our lives,\" she said. \u201cHow can we eradicate poverty without looking at this crisis? How can we achieve zero hunger if climate change is leaving millions of people with nothing to eat? We are going to see disaster after disaster, challenge after challenge, suffering after suffering ... if nothing is done about this.\" She called for leaders to \u201cleave their comfort zones and see the danger we are in and do something about it. This is a matter of life and death.\u201d There were also messages from South African climate activist Ayakha Melithafa and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who praised the younger generation's work. \u201cAlthough sometimes change can come from the top, more often the biggest changes start at the grassroots level because political leaders start paying attention if the calls for action are loud and persistent and unyielding,\u201d Gore said.  Figueres warned that the world is entering \u201cthe decisive decade\u201d for climate and environment, when the quality of life for hundreds of years could be decided. \u201cThat may sound like an exaggeration, but it's not,\" she said.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Milestone assessment warns half of global population highly vulnerable as world faces \u2018brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure liveable and sustainable future\u2019  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Half of the global population is highly vulnerable to the impacts of the  climate crisis  and the opportunity to secure a \u201cliveable\u201d future for all is fast disappearing, a major new assessment by the world\u2019s leading scientists has warned. \u201cUnequivocal\u201d human-caused global warming is already dangerously disrupting the natural world and some of its effects are irreversible, according to the second chapter of the sweeping report by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC). The assessment, the most authoritative look at global  climate change , published about every seven years, explores how rising temperatures are affecting communities and ecosystems, and what capacity there is to adapt. The final, virtual approval sessions for the IPCC report, released with approval from 195 member governments, ran late into the night. \u201cClimate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health. Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\u201d the authors warned. Exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) of warming \u2013 the ambitious target set by the Paris Agreement \u2013 will happen in the \u201cnear-term\u201d, the report said. So far, the world has warmed 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, and is already experiencing more severe heat, storms, flooding, and wildfires. Even temporarily surpassing 1.5C would cause unavoidable increases in multiple hazards, the IPCC says. Holding as close to 1.5C as possible would substantially reduce threats, compared to higher warming levels, but \u201ccannot eliminate them all\u201d. Our efforts to adapt to climate change have not gone far enough, and in some places, have already reached the limit.  While the authors say we need much faster \u201ctransformational\u201d action, they also underline that there are right and wrong ways to go about this. Meanwhile, adapting to climate change will become more difficult as temperatures continue to rise. In some regions this will go from challenging to \u201cimpossible\u201d if temperatures exceed 2C (3.6F), says the report. Other key findings include: \u2013 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in conditions that are highly vulnerable to climate change \u2013 Some losses are already irreversible, such as the first species extinctions driven by climate change  \u2013 Adverse impacts are \u201ccascading\u201d along coasts and cities, and in mountainous regions. These hazards trigger tipping points in sensitive ecosystems, and in systems impacted by ice melt, permafrost thaw and changing hydrology in polar regions \u2013 The most vulnerable people and ecosystems are being the hardest hit  \u2013 Weather extremes are occurring simultaneously, exposing millions of people to acute food and water insecurity especially in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, on Small Islands and in the Arctic \u2013 Mental health impacts assessed for the first time, and linked to rising heat, trauma from extreme events, and loss of livelihoods and culture. Children, teens, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions are particularly affected. Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, called the report \u201ca dire warning about the consequences of inaction\u201d. \u201cOur actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks,\u201d he said.  The report, involving 270 climate experts from 67 countries, was released in the shadow of the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces.  Last week it emerged that Ukrainian scientists  were forced to abandon the virtual approval session for the IPCC report out of fear for their families. Ukrainian scientists had tried to remain part of the process for the seminal report, even as they hid in bomb shelters and battled lack of internet access,  Politico  reported on Friday. During a briefing on Sunday, Professor Daniela Schmidt, a IPCC lead author from the University of Bristol, made an emotional statement about the conflict. \u201cThe Ukrainian delegation has asked all of us to continue and has expressed how upset they are that this will distract from the importance of the report,\u201d she said.  Referring to Ukrainian invasion, Professor Schmidt said: \u201cThe head of the Russian delegation has expressed very clearly that this is not the wish of all the Russian people, and the Russian people were not asked.\u201d On Tuesday, Russian scientists and scientific journalists published an open letter condemning attacks on Ukraine. \u201cMany of us have relatives, friends and scientific colleagues living in Ukraine. Our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought together against Nazism,\u201d they wrote. The war would turn Russia into a \u201cpariah\u201d, they noted, and that conducting scientific research would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d without international cooperation. \u2018Hard limits\u2019 The report reflects the progress made in the field of attribution \u2013 the science of how human-caused climate change is influencing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Hundreds died in heatwaves in the past year from the  US and Canada  to India, along with  Iraq  and other areas of the  Middle East . Flooding has devastated regions of Nigeria, India, China, Germany, Belgium and the UK, while wildfires have exploded across the Brazilian Amazon, Siberia, southern Europe and the American West. Extreme events are leading to cascading impacts that are increasingly difficult to manage. The new report found that many parts of the natural world are near the hard limits of their natural adaptation including warm water coral reefs, and tropical rainforests. Some communities living along coastlines and small-holder farmers are facing so-called \u201csoft limits\u201d to adapting to climate impacts, such as a lack of money.  There are also \u201chard limits\u201d for people\u2019s ability to adapt. Above 1.5C, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for small island communities, and for regions dependent on glacier and snow-melt.  At 2C warming, agriculture will be further hit including multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions.  The new assessment placed far more emphasis on how reliant humans are on nature and healthy ecosystems. It calls for conserving up to 50 per cent of land, fresh water and ocean habitats, along with restoring degraded ecosystems. The report particularly emphasises the importance of knowledge from Indigenous Peoples and local communities in doing so. The physical impacts of climate change on people were discussed at length. In all regions, extreme heat events have caused deaths and illness, the authors noted.  Climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases have increased due to conditions which allow diseases to travel into new areas or better reproduce. Animal and human diseases, including those which can jump from animals to humans like coronaviruses, are emerging in new areas. Water and food-borne disease risks have increased in some regions. Increased exposure to wildfire smoke and atmospheric dust have been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory distress. Meanwhile, extreme events like flooding disrupt communities\u2019 abilities to access health care.  From climate risk to climate resilient development Mental health impacts from climate change were linked to increasing temperatures, trauma from weather and climate extreme events, and loss of livelihoods and culture. This anxiety and stress is projected to rise under further global warming, particularly for children, adolescents, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. \u2018Maladaptation\u2019 Cities, home to more than half the global population, are hotspots of impacts and risks, but also a crucial part of the solution. Extreme climate-related weather events such as heatwaves, storms, droughts and flooding, along with slow-onset events like sea-level rise, negatively impact infrastructure like energy grids and public transport. Those in low income and marginalised communities are impacted the worst, and have the least resources to adapt. However cities can also be the source of action, for example with \u201cgreen buildings\u201d, reliable supplies of clean water and renewable energy, and sustainable transport that helps connect urban and rural areas. Since the last IPCC report in 2014, experts have more evidence of adaptation measures that have been implemented \u2013 those which have worked, and those with unintended negative consequences. One example of this so-called \u201cmaladaptation\u201d is sea walls. While they may help protect people from flooding in one location, sea walls can cause problems for others living further down a coastline.  Maladaptation especially negatively impacts Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities and low-income households, the authors note. The first instalment of the 6th cycle of the IPCC report was published in August and revealed that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that the world will reach 1.5C at some point over the next 20 years.  UN  Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the report a \u201ccode red for humanity\u201d. The third part will focus on mitigation \u2013 what needs to be done to limit planet-heating emissions \u2013 and is expected at the beginning of April. While there are many dire warnings in today\u2019s report, the authors also make clear that there is still significant opportunity to adapt but that accelerated strategies are needed, alongside slashing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions. Dr Helen Adams, a senior lecturer in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and IPCC author, said the path would be determined by the choices that societies and decision makers take. For example, if countries decide to invest in universal health care to help with rising cases of climate-linked illnesses, or install early warning systems for extreme weather.  \u201cYes, things are bad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the future depends on us, not the climate.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The astonishing weather experienced by the world last year and advances in climate science demonstrate conclusively that fossil fuel emissions are causing global warming \u2013 and something must be done about it. That was the reaction from scientist after scientist to a new report by the  World Meteorological Organisation  (WMO), which documented record-breaking droughts, heatwaves, rainfall, melting of sea ice and a host of tangible signs observed in 2016 that the Earth\u2019s climate has changed. Amid fears that Donald Trump will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Secretary-General of the WMO said it was \u201cvital\u201d to slash carbon emissions and prepare for increasingly dangerous weather. Writing in the report\u2019s foreword, Petteri Taalas said: \u201cThe influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident.  \u201cThis influence is increasingly being demonstrated by attribution studies for some of the most critical weather and climate extremes, in particular extremes related to heat.  \u201cIt is vital that [the Paris Agreement\u2019s] implementation becomes a reality and that [it] guides the global community in addressing climate change by curbing greenhouse gases, fostering climate resilience and mainstreaming climate adaptation into national development policies.\u201d The WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2016 pointed to multiple signs that our planet's weather is getting more extreme, including:  \u2022 the record average temperature for the year of about 1.1C above pre-industrial levels;  \u2022 millions of people going hungry after crops failed in parts of Africa as rainfall fell up to 60 per cent below average;  \u2022 flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands of people in south-east Asia;  \u2022 record low levels of sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic;  \u2022 the wettest ever winter on record in Scotland and China's wettest year; \u2022 France's driest July and August and the record driest winter and spring that helped produce Canada's worst-ever wildfire at Fort McMurray, Alberta; \u2022 extreme temperatures which saw records fall from Santiago in Chile, which hit 37.3C, to Svalbard in the Arctic, which was 6.5C warmer over the year than the average between 1961 and 1990; \u2022 devastating wildfires in Tasmania amid a prolonged drought; \u2022 and then devastating floods in Tasmania after the drought ended and the island experienced it wettest May to December on record. Climate scientists have been forecasting just such an increase in bad weather driven by the rising global temperature, with a huge amount of extra energy now being trapped in the atmosphere as a result the greenhouse gases humans pumped into the atmosphere. Increasingly, researchers have been able to show scientifically how individual weather events are made much more likely and more extreme by human-induced climate change. But there was a distinct note of desperation in a round-up of reaction from leading experts to the WMO report, produced by the  Science Media Centre . The election of Mr Trump \u2013 who has appointed a string of climate science deniers to key positions in his administration, such as Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 has given new currency to so-called sceptics the world over. This was  a major theme  of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting in Boston last month, and a March for Science and a Climate March are planned in Washington DC and other major cities around the world next month. Climate science 'scepticism' is far from confined to American right-wing politicians. Ukip\u2019s leader, Paul Nuttall, has suggested Al Gore\u2019s seminal film about climate change, The Inconvenient Truth, is \u201c in fact a convenient lie used by propagandists \u201d. But Dr Phil Williamson, an associate fellow at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cThe WMO's statement on the 2016 climate leaves no room for doubt.  \u201cIn the Olympics, records are broken by smaller and smaller amounts; in climate change, the opposite now seems to be true, not just for temperature, but for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, sea-ice cover and global sea level rise.  \u201cHuman-driven climate change is now an empirically verifiable fact, combining year-to-year variability with the consequences of our release of extra greenhouse gases. Those who dispute that link are not sceptics, but anti-science deniers.\u201d  Professor Dave Reay, chair in carbon management at Edinburgh University, said: \u201cThe Guinness Book of World Records now needs a whole new chapter for climate change.  \u201cFrom soaring temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations, to disintegrating ice and coral this new report on global change over the past year makes startling reading. \u201cThe need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high.\u201d For Dr Emily Shuckburgh, deputy head of polar oceans at the British Antarctic Survey , last year was simply \u201cexceptional\u201d. \u201cThe Arctic stood out as experiencing particularly extreme conditions,\u201d she said.  \u201cDuring winter the region saw the polar equivalent of a searing heatwave, with temperatures in January breaking previous records by a staggering 2C. \u201cThe changes we are now seeing in the polar regions are a stark reminder of the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.\u201d  However, in an age when the likes of then Cabinet Minister Michael Gove can insist people have \u201chad enough of experts\u201d, there is a realisation that many people have stopped listening to scientists and hard evidence. Professor Sir Robert Watson director of strategic development at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cWhile the data show an ever-increasing impact of human activities on the climate system, the Trump Administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand and state that climate change is a hoax and does not need to be addressed.  \u201cWe are now living in an evidence-free world, where facts are irrelevant. \u201cHow much more evidence does the world need to recognise the dangers confronting our society?\u201d The repeated warnings about climate change by scientists from different fields the world over had become like a \u201cbroken record\u201d endlessly playing the same refrain, said Dr Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at Arizona University. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cBut that's just the point. One new broken record after another: global warming on land and sea and other big effects across the Earth's surface,\u201d he joked grimly. \u201cEarth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere. In general, drastically changing conditions do not help civilization, which thrives on stability.  \u201cWe have to change, and our leaders must come face to face with reality and understand that their decisions will affect the future for better or worse. Every nation has a role to play in easing our dilemma and moving us away from worst-case scenarios.\u201d According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world could experience a rise in temperatures above pre-industrial levels of between 2.6 and 4.8 degrees Celsius by 2100 if humans carry on emitting fuels under a \u2018business as usual\u2019 scenario. However more recent research has suggested the Earth\u2019s atmosphere  could be more sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought , putting the planet potentially on course for more than 7C of warming. It is thought that \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change would occur after 2C of warming, although the Paris Agreement urged the world to try to restrict it to 1.5C if possible. Somewhere between warming of 3C and 4C, it is thought significant feedback loops would start to kick in, such as the release of vast amounts of methane from the Siberian tundra, which is already causing concern. This would drive global warming faster and, if it hit 6C, this would be \u201c game over \u201d for human civilisation as we know it.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Post-pandemic stimulus could mean\u00a0the difference between climate \u2018success and failure\u2019 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The global  lockdown  will have a \u201cnegligible\u201d impact on rising temperatures but a green recovery could avert the  climate crisis , a study has said. Lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus caused huge falls in transport use, as well as reductions in industry and commercial operations, cutting the greenhouse gases and pollutants caused by vehicles and other activities. The impact is only short-lived, however, and analysis shows that even if some lockdown measures last until the end of 2021, global temperatures will only be 0.01C lower than expected by 2030. But if countries choose a \u201cstrong\u201d green stimulus route out of the pandemic it could halve the temperature rises expected by 2050, the study published in  Nature Climate Change  said. That gives the world a good chance of keeping temperature rises to the 1.5C goal that countries signed up to under the international Paris climate agreement to prevent the most dangerous impacts of global warming. Recovery packages targeting low-carbon energy and energy efficiency and not giving bailouts for fossil fuels could \u201cmean the difference between success and failure\u201d on avoiding a dangerous climate crisis. Study lead author Professor Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds, started working on the analysis with his daughter Harriet after her A-levels were cancelled. They used mobility data from Google and Apple to calculate how 10 different greenhouse gases and pollutants changed between February and June in 123 countries, before a wider team helped with detailed analysis. The team also modelled options for post-lockdown action, ranging from a fossil-fuelled recovery to two different levels of green stimulus. Emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants fell by between 10 and 30 per cent, the analysis said. But because the reduction was only temporary, the impact on warming driven by the long-term build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will be very small. It is what happens now that is important, the researchers said. Strong action to drive the recovery through green measures could lead to greenhouse gas emissions being 50 per cent lower in 2030 than they would otherwise be, which would reduce expected warming by 0.3C by 2050. It could set the world on track to keep temperature rises to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists warn of worsening impacts of the climate crisis, including increased droughts and extreme weather, spread of diseases, reduced crop yields, rising seas and harm to wildlife. Professor Forster said: \u201cThe choices made now could give us a strong chance of avoiding 0.3C of additional warming by mid-century, halving the expected warming under current policies. \u201cThis could mean the difference between success and failure when it comes to avoiding dangerous climate change.\u201d He added: \u201cThe study also highlights the opportunities in lowering traffic pollution by encouraging low emissions vehicles, public transport and cycle lanes. \u201cThe better air quality will immediately have important health effects \u2013 and it will immediately start cooling the climate.\u201d Study co-author Harriet Forster, who has just completed her studies at Queen Margaret\u2019s School, said: \u201cOur paper shows that the actual effect of lockdown on the climate is small. \u201cThe important thing to recognise is that we\u2019ve been given a massive opportunity to boost the economy by investing in green industries \u2013 and this can make a huge difference to our future climate.\u201d Study co-author Corinne Le Quere from the  University of East Anglia  added: \u201cThe fall in emissions we experienced during  Covid-19  is temporary and therefore it will do nothing to slow down climate change, but the government responses could be a turning point if they focus on a green recovery, helping to avoid severe impacts from climate change.\u201d PA Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Democratic governors such as California's  Gavin Newsom  and Washington's Jay Inslee have been clear about their plans to boost spending on climate-related projects, including expanding access to electric vehicles and creating more storage for clean energies such as solar. Newsom deemed climate change one of five \u201cexistential threats\" facing the nation's most populous state when he rolled out his proposed state budget this past week. In Republican-led states, governors want to protect communities from natural disasters and drought, even as many of them won't link such spending to global warming. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey this past week pitched $1 billion for water infrastructure as drought grips the Western U.S., shriveling water supplies for cities and farms. Idaho Gov.  Brad Little  who has acknowledged climate change's role in worsening wildfires, proposed $150 million for five years' worth of fire-fighting costs, plus more for new fire personnel. In South Carolina, Gov.  Henry McMaster  called on lawmakers to spend $300 million in federal money for, among other things, protecting the state's coastline against flooding, erosion and storm damage. \u201cI can think of no more meritorious use of taxpayer funds than to protect these pristine properties for future generations of South Carolinians,\" he said as he presented his proposed state budget, which also includes $17 million to use in the aftermath of hurricanes and other natural disasters. Governors' proposals are just the first step in budget negotiations, and they'll have to work with state lawmakers on the final details. Many governors will issue their plans in the coming weeks, with some already telegraphing their priorities. New York\u2019s Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, used her state of the state address to call for $500 million in spending on offshore wind projects. This year's discussions on how to spend taxpayers' money comes not only as many states are seeing massive budget surpluses, but also as the negative effects of changing weather patterns are becoming ever harder to ignore. As drought continued in much of the West, an unseasonable December wildfire ripped through a Colorado neighborhood near Boulder. Deadly off-season tornados ravaged Kentucky, and several hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast. Late summer temperatures soared to sweltering, record-breaking levels in the Pacific Northwest.  \u201cThe climate crisis is not an abstraction. It is something that I and every governor in the United States, almost on a weekly basis, have to deal with,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said this past week. Meanwhile, Democratic President Joe Biden's $2 trillion package of social and environmental initiatives is stalled in Congress, leaving the prospect of more federal money to fight climate change uncertain. States, mostly led by Democrats, took on a larger role advancing climate policies during former Republican President Donald Trump's time in office. Most states are awash in money as tax collections have exceeded expectations because of strong consumer spending and rising prices, which together have bolstered sales tax revenue. On top of that, states are taking in billions of dollars in federal pandemic relief and are preparing for a big boost in federal infrastructure money after Congress passed a $1 trillion public works bill in November. Beyond increasing climate spending, states are looking to the windfall to pad their reserves, cut taxes, boost funding for education and increase affordable housing. California is home to the most ambitious climate spending, with Newsom calling for $22 billion for various projects spread over the next five years. The bulk of that would go to transportation projects such as electrifying school buses and expanding vehicle charging stations into disadvantaged communities. He also proposed another $2 billion for clean energy development and storage. California-based companies that work to address climate change and develop green technologies could be eligible for tax credits. Through programs to build more housing in downtown corridors and make communities more walkable, Newsom threaded his efforts to tackle climate change throughout his budget proposal. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and legislative leaders promised increased investments related to wildfires, such as adding fire response equipment and training for firefighters, after last month\u2019s Boulder County wildfire. The Democratic governor has requested about $75 million for such efforts, and the Democratic-led Legislature has signaled it wants more. Polis also wants to spend $425 million on electrifying bus and truck fleets, aerial and ground monitoring of oil and gas emissions, and more.  \u201cFrom extreme floods to megafires to seemingly never-ending ozone alerts, our state\u2019s long-term health is on the line. ... We have to do everything in our power to make sure this is not the new normal,\" Colorado Senate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg said. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, has asked the state legislature to fund the creation of a \u201cclimate change bureau,\u201d with a 15-member staff and $2.5 million initial budget. It would implement pollution standards for vehicles and push the state's economy toward a point where just as much carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere as is being emitted. Her administration has offered limited details on the proposal. Even as they prioritize climate initiatives, many governors are balancing those plans with a need to support their state's current economy as it transitions away from a dependence on fossil fuels. In New Mexico, the output of oil and natural gas has surged to an all-time high under Lujan Grisham\u2019s administration. At least one-fourth of the state's general fund budget can be traced to income from the oil and natural gas industries \u2013 underwriting public education, health care and other services. In some states, it's lawmakers who are driving climate spending. Democrats who control Maryland's legislature are pushing a climate change measure that would reduce methane emissions, modernize the electric grid and invest in green technology. The package, subject to negotiations, would accelerate the state\u2019s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The current plan is to cut emissions by 40% of 2006 levels by 2030. The Democrats' new plans is to raise that emissions reduction to 60%. They also want to set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045, meaning at least as much carbon is being removed from the atmosphere as what's being emitted. Money for climate programs could come from the state's $4.6 billion budget surplus and federal infrastructure funding. Maryland Democrats have enough members to override any vetoes by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, though he has previously supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. State Sen. Paul Pinsky, a Democrat, said advancing climate policy has political merits, particularly in the state that is home to Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary. All Maryland state lawmakers are up for re-election this year, as are about two-thirds of governors across the U.S. \u201cI think legislators want to be able to run on something, and people should be accountable,\" Pinsky said. \"Do they support the environment and this kind of bold action or not?\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Jim Anderson in Denver; Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Michelle Liu in Columbia, South Carolina; Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho; and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

Professor Michael Mann said extreme weather events \u2013 such as the \u201cunprecedented\u201d drought in California last year, the flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and the heatwave in Europe in 2003 \u2013 were happening more often than they should do, even taking the warming climate into account. This, he said, meant there had to be an additional factor. \u200bJetstreams are influenced by the difference in temperatures between the Arctic and the equator.  But the Arctic has been warming much faster than tropical climates \u2013 the island of Svalbard, for example was 6.5 degrees celsius warmer last year compared to the average between 1961 and 1990. The land has also been warming faster than the sea. Both of those factors were changing the flow of these major air currents to create \u201cextreme meanders\u201d which were helping to cause \u201cextreme weather events\u201d, Professor Mann said. Last year, another leading climate scientist warned that the rapid rate of warming in the Arctic could have a  \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effect  on the weather in the northern hemisphere. In  a paper in the journal  Scientific Reports , Professor Mann and other researchers wrote that evidence of the effect of climate change on the jetstreams had \u201conly recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability\u201d. They said that projections of the effect on the jetstreams in \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d climate models were \u201cmirrored\u201d in \u201cmultiple\u201d actual temperature measurements. Professor Michael Mann, of the Pennsylvania State University, said: \u201cThe unprecedented 2016 California drought, the 2011 US heatwave and 2010 Pakistan flood as well as the 2003 European hot spell all belong to a most worrying series of extremes. \u201cThe increased incidence of these events exceeds what we would expect from the direct effects of global warming alone, so there must be an additional climate change effect.  \u201cIn data from computer simulations as well as observations, we identify changes that favour unusually persistent, extreme meanders of the jetstream that support such extreme weather events.  \u201cHuman activity has been suspected of contributing to this pattern before, but now we uncover a clear fingerprint of human activity.\u201d The jetstream normally flows reasonably consistently around the planet, but can develop loops extending north and south. The researchers, who studied temperature records going back to 1870 as well as satellite data, said these loops could grow \u201cvery large\u201d or even \u201cgrind to a halt\u201d rather than moving from west to east.  Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan The effect has been most pronounced during the past 40 years, they found. \u201cThe more frequent persistent and meandering jetstream states seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon, which makes it even more relevant,\u201d said Dim Coumou of the Department of Water and Climate Risk at Vrije University in Amsterdam.  \u201cWe certainly need to further investigate this \u2013 there is some good evidence, but also many open questions.  \u201cIn any case, such non-linear responses of the earth system to human-made warming should be avoided.  \u201cWe can limit the risks associated with increases in weather extremes if we limit greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The former president was speaking to  Fox Business  on Monday when he was asked if he thought the climate is changing because of human activity.  \u201cIn my opinion, you have a thing called weather, and you go up and you go down. If you look into the 1920s they were talking about global freezing,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cIn other words, the globe was going to freeze, and then they go \u2018global warming\u2019, then they couldn\u2019t use that because the temperatures were actually quite cool, and many different things so that now they just talk about  climate change . The climate has always been changing.\u201d Mr Trump mockingly said at a South Carolina rally that \u201cthe world is going to be destroyed because the oceans are going to rise 1\/100 of an inch within the next 300 years. It\u2019s going to kill everybody\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to create more oceanfront property. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d he added.  Florida tops the list for sea level-rise risk in the US. Globally, the seas have risen six to eight inches (15-20 cm) over the last century, a rate that has accelerated in the past two decades. More than 90 per cent of excess heat in the atmosphere \u2013 caused by greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil, gas and coal \u2013 is absorbed by the ocean. Heat causes water to expand and raises sea levels, with melting glaciers and ice sheets compounding the problem. Average sea level along the US coastline is expected to rise by 10 - 12 inches (25-30cm) in the next 30 years, according to a  2022 update  from the National and Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Coastal flooding will worsen, NOAA says. Higher sea levels mean higher tides and storm surges, pushing water further inland. By 2050, \u201cmoderate\u201d flooding \u2013 the kind which causes damage \u2013 will happen more than 10 times as often as it does today, on average. As  The Independent  reported last week , Mr Trump\u2019s private club Mar-a-Lago is unlikely to escape. Even with conservative projections of sea level rise, water could be sloshing over the club\u2019s manicured lawns from the intracoastal waterway in the next 30 years, according to  Climate Central\u2019s  coastal risk screening tool based on the latest NOAA data. Mr Trump criticised the emissions of China, India, Russia, and \u201call these other countries that are very dirty\u201d.  \u201cDon\u2019t forget with those dirty countries, when those fumes go up into the air, it blows right over the centre of the United States. Just like they dump their garbage in the ocean,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem is, the green technology isn\u2019t powerful enough ... so if we want to stop being a great manufacturing capital let\u2019s go green. Let\u2019s go to the windmills,\u201d Mr Trump said.  \u201cThe wind is very intermittent,\u201d he added, instead pushing for \u201cclean\u201d coal and natural gas.  \u201cWe have clean natural gas. We have more energy than any other country. And we have clean coal, they have ... coal technology, which is incredible .... We have so many things that we\u2019re sitting on top of I call it liquid gold. And our liquid gold makes us more ... competitive,\u201d Mr Trump said.  Mr Trump has been speaking about \u201cclean coal\u201d for years.  \u201cClean coal turns out to mean largely whatever one wants it to mean,\u201d mechanical engineering and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, Edward Rubin, told  factcheck.org in 2018.  \u201cThese days, my own sense is that talking about clean coal without extending it to mean significant reductions in carbon emissions is basically ignoring the climate-related impacts of coal combustion,\u201d he added.

Climate change  is the biggest issue of concern for the  British  public, a new  poll  has found, scoring higher than the  pandemic , Brexit and the  NHS .  The monthly poll, carried out by Ipsos MORI, showed that concern for climate change is at its highest level since  records  began in 1988.  Four in ten people rank the joint category of \u2018climate change, pollution and the environment\u2019 as the biggest issue facing Britain today. The  polling  was done from the 5-11 November, covering the end of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow and surveyed 1,001 people.  The pandemic was the second biggest issue of concern, with 27 per cent of people mentioning the topic. Brexit - together with the EU and Europe - came in third, with 22 per cent of people mentioning it.  Concern about the environment was equally high across demographic groups, with Labour voters as likely to list it as Conservative voters. But interestingly there was a big difference of attitude across age groups.  Almost half of those aged between 55 and 64 said environment was a big issue. 43 per cent of those aged 35-54 said they saw climate change as a concern, but this then shrank to 27 per cent of those aged between 18 and 34.  Although younger people were less likely to say they were worried about most issues they are more concerned about Covid than other age groups.  This is only the third time that climate change has topped the list of the nation\u2019s concerns, according to the Ipsos poll.  The previous highest score for the issues was in July 1989, when it scored 35 per cent and topped the list. The environment was also the joint-biggest issue in July 1990, ranking at 30 per cent along with the NHS and local government issues.  While there was a clear increase in concern for the planet during the month of the Cop26 conference, there has also been longer term growth in its perceived importance.  YouGov\u2019s poll on the most important issues facing the country shows that concern for the environment has been rising steadily since the beginning of the year. 23 per cent of people mentioned the topic to pollsters in January this year, this has now risen to 34 per cent for November.  Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow at the University of Sussex business school, said that climate change was becoming a top priority for people because it was \u201cbecoming personal\u201d.  Speaking about the Ipsos MORI survey, she told  CNN : \u201cWe are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change - from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A letter titled \u201cThere is no climate emergency\u201d \u2013 which has been signed by 400 people who deem climate change to be a myth \u2013 is being sent to leaders of  European Union  (EU) and  United Nations  (UN) institutions in the coming weeks ahead of key environment talks. The group will take further steps, which are to be outlined in press conferences in Oslo, Brussels, The Hague and Rome. The climate deniers are connected to a transatlantic network of think tanks pushing for environmental deregulation after Brexit, which also have a history of climate science denial. The letter, obtained by investigative non-profit news organisation  DeSmog ,  shows the group has links with members of  Boris Johnson \u2019s Cabinet. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images The \u201cEuropean Declaration\u201d letter claims current changes in the climate are \u201cexpected from the cyclic behaviour of the climate system\u201d. It also says there is \u201cno proof\u201d that carbon dioxide is a major driver of climate change. There are two signatories associated with the Cato Institute \u2013 who left the think tank in May - and several signatories from the Heartland Institute in the US, both of which are part of the Koch-funded Atlas Network. UK-based free-market organisations such as the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Adam Smith Institute (ASI), and Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance also belong to the network. Matthew Elliot \u2013 who is now reported to be advising Chancellor Sajid Javid \u2013 founded Taxpayer\u2019s Alliance. An old employee of Taxpayer\u2019s Alliance, Chloe Westley, has also joined Mr Johnson\u2019s team at No 10. Liz Truss has appointed two special advisors from the IEA and ASI.  The UK\u2019s main climate denial group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), founded by former chancellor Nigel Lawson, is well represented on the list. The group\u2019s \u201curgent message\u201d is that the EU net-zero carbon goal \u2013 a policy that was blocked by Poland and three other member states in June \u2013 should be \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d. \u201cThere is no climate emergency and therefore no cause for panic and alarm ... Our advice to political leaders is that science should aim at significantly better understanding the climate system while politics should focus on minimising potential climate damage,\u201d the letter reads. Robert Brulle, professor of sociology at Drexel University and an expert on climate science denial, told  DeSmog  it looked like a panicked response to the significant media coverage on the climate crisis after influential protests by Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg. \u201cThe talking points are stale and patently scientific nonsense. That isn\u2019t critical. The point would be to keep the \u2018contested\u2019 nature of climate change alive,\u201d he said. Geoffrey Supran, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, said he thought the move was an attempt to distract efforts to increase action at the UN Climate Action Summit at the end of the month. He said: \u201cAs always, they presumably hope to muddy the waters of public and political discourse on the climate crisis \u2013 to feed the echo chamber of sympathetic right-wing media and blogs, and to prey on naive and unsuspecting journalists who may be tempted to exercise false balance in their climate coverage.\u201d The campaign is being run by a Netherlands-based climate science denial group called the Climate Intelligence Foundation (Clintel). It was founded by Guus Berkhout who began his career at Shell and set up the Delphi Consortium in the 1980s to work on new ways to extract oil and gas. He says there are \u201ca lot of great names on the list\u201d and that they all give a \u201cvaluable contribution to the climate debate\u201d. One signatory is Northumbria University\u2019s Professor Valentina Zharkova, who gave a lecture last year saying climate change is caused by solar cycles. She co-authored a paper on the subject that was published in June and criticised for containing \u201cbasic errors\u201d. The journal has said that it has commenced an \u201cestablished process\u201d to investigate the paper it has published. Other signatories of the letter include directors and former directors of oil and gas companies as well as five fellows of the Geological Society of London, a professional body that represents Earth scientists. The letter also coincides with government meetings in Germany on 20 September on how the country will meet its 2030 emissions target. Mr Berkhout confirmed the letter was real. He told  The Independent : \u201cThe initiative aims at a lot more than providing a declaration. We will reveal our ambitions and plans in a series of press conferences in Europe, starting in Brussels, Oslo and Rome.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Speaking to the House of Lords\u2019  Economic Affairs Committee , Lord Lawson said he did not \u201cquestion for a moment\u201d that carbon dioxide was a greenhouse gas. And he accepted there was \u201chuge agreement\u201d among scientists that it was having \u201csome effect\u201d on the atmosphere. But the former Conservative Cabinet minister argued it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d for the UK to try to stop burning the fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide, claiming countries like China were simply carrying on doing so. Lord Lawson founded the  Global Warming Policy Foundation  in 2009 to oppose attempts to reduce the rise in temperatures and has  emerged as one of Britain\u2019s leading sceptics . But, unlike many \u201cdeniers\u201d in the US, he made clear he accepted much of the basic science. \u201cI don\u2019t question for a moment that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that other things being equal this will lead to a warming of the atmosphere,\u201d  he told the Lords\u2019 committee . \u201cIt is true that scientists differ greatly on how big the effect is, but I think there\u2019s a huge agreement there is some effect.\u201d However Lord Lawson argued Britain should stop trying to decarbonise the economy, claiming this would make little difference to the total global emissions and put the UK at an economic disadvantage to other parts of the world. \u201cWe account for less than two per cent of global carbon emissions and so it\u2019s crazy for us \u2026 we cannot do anything on our own,\u201d he said. He named China and India as two countries which he said had made clear they planned to continue using fossil fuels on a significant scale. A report published earlier this year on  investment in renewable energy generation  found that China topped the international league table for renewables \u2013 not including large-scale hydro power \u2013 followed by the US, Japan, the UK and India. It concluded that the developing world was now spending more than the developed world on renewables for the first time partly because the energy was \u201cthe most environmentally sound but also the cheapest option\u201d. EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA John Sauven,  Greenpeace UK 's executive director, said Lord Lawson\u2019s comments demonstrated \u201c quite a U-turn from someone who once called the scientific consensus on climate change \u2018mumbo jumbo\u2019 and extolled the virtues of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere\u201d.  \u201cWith the impacts of climate change now playing out before our eyes, merchants of doubt like Lord Lawson are finding their dodgy wares ever harder to sell,\u201d he said. \u201cWheeling out the old argument that the UK shouldn\u2019t go it alone on climate won\u2019t be much help either. By ratifying the Paris climate deal, the US and China have debunked that myth too.  \u201cLord Lawson should now summon the courage to carry the argument through to its logical conclusion \u2013 that we need to act quickly to cut our dependence on fossil fuels and embrace clean energy.\u201d Richard Black, director of the  Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit , suggested Lord Lawson was behind the times. \u201cIn the last few years there\u2019s been a massive turnaround in the seriousness with which major nations are treating climate change, stimulated both by growing evidence of impacts and the fast-changing economics of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cMajor economies are all reforming their energy systems, headed by China where the government has blocked new coal-fired plants in most provinces and is instead speeding ahead with wind, solar and nuclear investment. \u201cOne result of this turnaround is that for the last two years, the global economy has grown but emissions have not \u2013 and the other is the Paris Agreement, made last December, under which every country will constrain its carbon emissions.  \u201cThe world is changing fast \u2013 and not everyone has caught up.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

According to Gioachino Roberti, a PhD student at the University of Clermont Auvergne, glaciers can suppress volcanic eruptions by providing mountains with structural stability. As the climate becomes warmer, ice melting from these mountains removes support from their slopes, potentially leading to landslides and collapse. \u201cImagine the ice like some sort of protective layer \u2013 when the ice melts away, the mountain is free to collapse,\u201d said Mr Roberti. \u201cIf your mountain is a volcano you have another problem. \u201cVolcanoes are a pressurised system and if you remove pressure by ice melting and landslide, you have a problem.\u201d Presenting his work at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, Mr Roberti  explained a case study  he and his collaborators had investigated in Canada. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Though not famous for its volcanic activity, Canada is home to hundreds of potentially active volcanoes. The scientists chose to focus on Mount Meager, a glaciated volcano north of Vancouver. Mount Meager\u2019s last eruption was over 2000 years ago, but Mr Roberti chose to focus on Mount Meager for a more recent natural disaster that took place there. In summer 2010, the largest landslide in Canadian history occurred on the southern part of the volcano. \u201cThe glacier base of the slope retreated and during the hottest part of the summer, the slope catastrophically failed \u2013 the whole mountain started to move at a very high velocity,\u201d said Mr Roberti. This was followed in 2016 by the formation of ice caves in the glacier as hot volcanic gases seeped out of the volcano. \u201cThis is the first time this has happened there \u2013 so the equilibrium of the mountain is changing,\u201d said Mr Roberti.  To understand these events, the scientists used numerical modelling of the volcano to examine the link between melting ice on the glacier and changes to the magma \u201cplumbing system\u201d inside it. They found that landslides had the potential to destabilise the magma chamber and trigger an eruption \u2013 a phenomenon that can be linked directly to a warmer climate. \u201cWe see a correlation between high temperature, ice melting and landslides,\u201d said Mr Roberti. \u201cToday\u2019s increasing temperature is likely to cause other large landslides.\u201d Other scientists welcomed the research by Mr Roberti and his colleagues, although they noted the complexity of the systems involved and the difficulty in making direct links between climate change and eruptions. \u201cThis new research nicely demonstrates that if you change the load on a volcanic mountain \u2013 for example by removing some ice \u2013 the likelihood of a mechanical collapse and possible ensuing eruption will be slightly increased,\u201d said Professor David Rothery, a geoscientist at The Open University who was not involved in the research. \u201cEruptions are triggered by a complex array of factors. I suspect that many eruptions caused by glacial melting might happen eventually anyway, given enough time \u2013 but this research shows that warming could increase the chances of those eruptions happening sooner rather than later.\u201d Dr David McGarvie, another researcher at The Open University who was not involved with the research, said that evidence is still lacking for ice-capped volcanoes like Mount Meager erupting due to ice melting. However, he noted this was not the case for volcanoes buried under ice sheets in Iceland and Antarctica.  \u201cThere is more and better evidence across Iceland that when the ice sheet underwent major reduction at the end of the last glacial period, there was a large increase in both the frequency and volume of basalt erupted \u2013 with some estimates being 30 times higher than the present day,\u201d he said. However, he said the scale of ice melting currently being seen is not on the same scale as the end of the glacial period. Presenting his research  alongside Mr Roberti was Matthias Schl\u00f6gl, a PhD student at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, whose studies also focused on climate change-driven landslides. As landslides tend to be caused by heavy rainfall \u2013 which is expected to increase due to climate change \u2013 these events are likely to become more common in the future. Mr Schl\u00f6gl\u2019s research has explored the impact such landslides will have on Europe\u2019s transport network. \u201cLandslides are an important issue today, and we expect that climate change \u2013 particularly changes in rainfall patterns and changes in temperature \u2013 will increase, and will furthermore affect the slope stability and trigger additional landslide events in the future,\u201d Mr Schl\u00f6gl said. Scientists are  becoming increasingly confident in  attributing the rise in frequency and severity of natural disasters to climate change. The  drought currently affecting Cape Town  has been linked with climate change,  as was Hurricane Harvey  when it struck the south east US at the end of 2017. The new results presented by these researchers suggests that geological phenomena as well as weather events are being fundamentally altered by the changing climate.

While many people took the opportunity to enjoy the hot weather, the unprecedented temperatures also appear to have led many to worry about what caused it. The poll by Opinium showed 60 per cent of British adults think climate change made the heatwave \u201cstronger or more likely to happen\u201d. It also revealed almost a third of respondents (30 per cent) now describe themselves as \u201cvery concerned\u201d about climate change \u2013 higher than any poll since 2008. A further 42 per cent said they are \u201cfairly\u201d concerned. The soaring summer heat surpassed the record set in 1976 in England and daytime temperatures regularly rose above 30C across the country throughout June and July. The dry conditions had a significant  impact on farms , with warnings food prices could rise in the coming months. There were also record A&E admissions over the summer. Meanwhile temperatures across the northern hemisphere were also anomalous. Sweden recorded its hottest July in over 260 years, and was forced to issue an appeal for international aid as wildfires ravaged swathes of forest above the Arctic Circle where temperatures exceeded 30C. The heatwave which enveloped northern Europe was made  twice as likely  due to the effects of climate change, according to an international team of scientists from the World Weather Attribution network. But climate change writer Leo Barasi, author of  The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism , who developed the Opinium poll, suggested the impact of the heatwave in the UK was still yet to be fully realised and concern could soon increase further. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan He told  The Independent : \u201cIn the UK we have just had this heatwave which most people link with climate change \u2013 concern has gone up, but it hasn\u2019t completely rocketed. It\u2019s a bit of a double-edged thing \u2013 they believe it was definitely a sign of climate change, just as the science says, but most people\u2019s experience of it was not unequivocally awful \u2013 not like a massive forest fire or a terrible hurricane. Some people quite enjoyed it. \u201cBut what we will start getting are the consequences of it \u2013 food prices being higher, data from hospitals showing the effects of the heatwave, and farmers having problems with feed for their animals.\u201d He added: \u201cIf there\u2019s a penny dropping about the heatwave, then it\u2019s when the effects start to hit people.\u201d The research also indicated that climate change is among the top five issues the public, particularly younger people, want politicians to talk about more \u2013 ahead of prominent issues like Brexit, the economy and education, though behind health, immigration, housing and crime. Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told  The Independent : \u201cPublic awareness of the effects that climate change is having now is in tune with the science, which has shown that emissions from human activity made this summer\u2019s heatwave twice as likely to occur. \u201cThis is also not the first time that the fingerprints of climate change have been seen on extreme weather events in the UK, with devastating storms that caused hundreds of millions of pounds in damage in 2015 made 40 per cent more likely by climate change.\u201d He added: \u201cAs more of these events occur in the UK, public support for action to cut emissions is likely to continue to swell.\u201d A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told  The Independent : \u201cWe are taking robust action to ensure our country is resilient and prepared for the challenges a changing climate brings.  \u201cOur long-term plan for climate change adaptation sets out ongoing work and investment to make sure food and water supplies are protected, businesses and communities are properly prepared and the right infrastructure is in place.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in First evidence that environmental conditions play major part in splitting up famously faithful birds  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The familiarity and coordination which black-browed albatrosses gain from forming a monogamous bond is often essential for successfully raising healthy offspring Albatrosses , typically monogamous birds, are now increasingly splitting up because of  ocean  warming due to the climate crisis, a study has found. These growing \u201cdivorce\u201d rates between the birds might hinder their abilities to successfully raise their offspring, said the research, published in the journal  Proceedings of the Royal Society B  on Wednesday. Over 90 per cent of all bird species are monogamous and splitting up is regarded as an adaptive strategy to correct for suboptimal partnerships triggered by previous breeding failures, said the researchers, including Francesco Ventura, a bird biologist at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. While \u201cdivorce\u201d rates among  albatrosses  were found to be typically less than 4 per cent on average, the study found this number doubled to nearly 8 per cent when the oceans were warmer. The findings provide the first evidence that it is not just breeding failure, but also environmental conditions that play a part in \u201cdivorcing\u201d the long-living monogamous birds. Albatrosses have a decades-long lifespan and spend most of their time at sea, returning to land only to breed. The familiarity and coordination which members of a pair gain from forming a monogamous bond is often essential for successfully raising healthy offspring, the scientists pointed out. If the breeding fails, however, many albatrosses \u2013 mostly females \u2013 leave their partner and try to find better mates, the study noted. In the research, the scientists assessed data collected between 2004 and 2019 on a large colony of black-browed albatrosses living on New Island in the  Falkland Islands . They tracked bird breakups that happened during this period and also found there were nearly 2,900 breeding attempts in 424 females. Typically, only breeding success was thought to play a role in the birds splitting up, the scientists said.  With each female  albatross  in a pair laying just one egg during a breeding season, it was found that birds whose eggs didn\u2019t hatch were over five times as likely to separate from their partners compared to those who succeeded. While in many years, the researchers said this \u201cdivorce\u201d rate was lower than 1 per cent, it reached a maximum of 7.7 per cent in 2017 when ocean waters were the warmest. This number lowered in the next two years when sea temperatures dropped. \u201cWe detected temporal variability in the divorce rate in our study population on New Island, Falklands\/Malvinas, so we wondered whether environmental fluctuations had a role in explaining the highs and lows of divorce,\u201d Dr Ventura told  The Independent .  \u201cIn our albatross population, the breeding rate and success are lower in years with warm sea surface temperatures anomaly,\u201d he added. This direct effect, the scientists said, might be due to the greater costs of reproduction in tough years, which birds pay by returning later to the colony and pairs pay by returning asynchronously to the breeding colony. Explaining the role played by rising sea surface temperature, Dr Ventura said ocean warming affects prey availability of albatrosses by altering the supply of nutrients in the water. \u201cSpecifically, high sea surface temperatures are indicative of resource-poor years. This is particularly worrying, as ocean warming is one of the observed and predicted consequences of climate change, also in the Southern Ocean home of our albatross population,\u201d he added. The researchers said physiological stress due to higher levels of stress hormones in the tougher years may also be another reason for the high \u201cdivorce\u201d rates. \u201cFor the first time, to our knowledge, we document the disruptive effects of challenging environmental conditions on the breeding processes of a monogamous population, potentially mediated by higher reproductive costs, changes in phenology, and physiological stress,\u201d the scientists wrote in the study.

Record hot temperatures were forecast through the weekend in California with a rare wintertime heat advisory in effect for southern parts of the state.  As the game kicked off at 3.30pm (PST) at SoFi Stadium in the city of Inglewood, south of Los Angeles, the temperature fell back from the day\u2019s high, almost setting a record as the hottest Super Bowl ever. When the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals took to the field the temperature stood at 82F (28C) having cooled slightly from a high of 85F a few hours before. The hottest it has ever been for a Super Bowl was back in 1973 when the Miami Dolphins faced off against the Washington Commanders. The temperature during the game, which was also played in LA, hit 84 degrees Fahrenheit. A persistent ridge of high pressure remains parked over the Golden State, the  National Weather Service  (NWS) reported on Friday, sending temperatures soaring above seasonal norms. On Saturday, temperatures in the 70s and 80s stood to break a number of daily highs in locations up and down the West Coast, from  San Diego  to Medford, Oregon.  The hottest temperatures were expected over parts of  Southern California , where the Super Bowl is taking place. Highs reached into the low 90s. High temperatures around LA at this point in the winter are usually in the mid-60s. The heat advisory remains in effect around the greater LA metro area until 6pm on Sunday. The NWS warns that hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses to occur, and advised residents to drink plenty of fluids and stay out of the sun. Inside the SoFi stadium, players and spectators will likely be shielded from the brunt of the heat as the arena is temperature controlled. The hot and dry conditions, along with seasonal Santa Ana winds in southern California, aided the spread of a wildfire in the early hours of Thursday in Laguna Beach.  The fire, which has torched 145 acres, is now 20 per cent contained, Cal Fire reported. Evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes late on Thursday. \u201cWe no longer have a fire season \u2013 we have a fire year,\u201d Orange County fire authority Chief Brian Fennessy told a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s February 10. It\u2019s supposed to be the middle of winter. We\u2019re anticipating 80 to 90F weather. Even though the hillsides are green, it doesn\u2019t take but low humidity and wind to cause fires to occur.\u201d 2021 was the fifth-hottest year on record globally as emissions of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, the main drivers of the climate crisis from burning fossil fuels, continue to rise.  In California, the picture was no different. Last summer was the state\u2019s hottest ever recorded, according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Average temperatures have risen around 1C in the past century in the state. At the same time, California\u2019s rainfall has become less frequent in autumn and spring, while winter storms are increasingly volatile.  California is historically prone to long periods of drought, but these will increase with global heating and less reliable rainfall.

Ecologists and conservationists are studying why some areas are more resilient to extreme events, such as fire and drought, and how they could protect at-risk creatures as the impacts of climate change increase over time. Officially called 'disturbance refugia \u2014 biodiversity 'lifeboats' more informally \u2014 they are a burgeoning new area of scientific research. The areas will become increasingly important to help save species from extinction as the impacts of climate change and increased agriculture eating become more severe. With careful planning, these 'lifeboats' can act as \"stepping\u2010stones for multiple species as climates continue to change\", according to Oregon State University researchers. Combined with the study of climate\u2010change adaptation, it can provide practical information for land resource managers to think about solutions for protecting vulnerable species.  Forest ecologist, Dr Meg Krawchuk, who co-authored the new paper, said these locations share characteristics that shield them from some of the damage that climate change can do in other parts of the landscape, including the type of terrain and vegetation; proximity to bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and streams and the direction of slopes.  Dr Krawchuk told  The News Guard : \u201cDetecting refugia in multiple places and at different times and understanding what\u2019s behind their occurrence, persistence and value in sustaining biodiversity are important frontiers in science and land management. \"Developing a disturbance refugia framework that recognizes multiple types of forest disturbance under one banner is an important step for research and management of forest ecosystems that are changing as the planet warms.\u201d She gave the example of the northern spotted owl in the  Pacific Northwest  which takes refuge in old-growth forests but explained that they are \"slowly being nibbled away by recent high-severity fires\". Although recent studies have focused on the impact from wildfires, climate change is likely to bring more severe droughts and insect outbreaks that will alter ecosystems and erode biodiversity.  The study led by Dr Krawchuk and Dr Garrett Meigs, from OSU's College of Forestry, explored how an overlap of disturbances can affect biodiversity \"lifeboats\". Refugia science can apply beyond forests and has shown other uses, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Krawchuk added: \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly realizing that refugia science might provide theory and analysis of the critical role of refugia in social and ecological resilience. \u201cFor example, as resistance to diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, pandemics like COVID-19, political turmoil, violence and land use issues, particularly in the context of extreme events. Refugia are areas of resistance that contribute to system-level resilience.\u201d The  research paper  was published earlier this month in the journal, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

The judge made the comment on Wednesday as she was questioned by California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and a member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee . Senator Harris asked Ms Barrett a series of questions, including whether she thought the coronavirus is infectious, whether smoking causes cancer and whether \u201cclimate change is happening and it\u2019s threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink\u201d. The judge responded that she thought Covid-19 was infectious and that people could get cancer from smoking. However she declined to answer on climate change, calling it \u201ca very contentious matter of public debate, and I will not do that, I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial\u201d. Some 97 per cent  or more of climate  scientist s agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are being driven by human activities, largely the burning fossil fuels.\u00a0 The Supreme court nominee doubled down on comments she made on Tuesday, where she said that she has no \u201cfirm views\u201d on climate change because she is \u201cnot a scientist\u201d. Judge Barrett returned to  Capitol Hill  for a third day on Wednesday as senators dug into the conservative nominee\u2019s stances on the Affordable Care Act, the landmark abortion ruling  Roe v Wade , and potentially a disputed presidential election.\u00a0 She expertly deflected some lines of questioning, insisting she would bring no personal agenda to the court but decide cases \u201cas they come\". On Tuesday, Republican Senator John Kennedy, of Louisiana, pursued questions aimed at, as he put it, showing what President Trump\u2019s nominee \u201cthought about the world\u201d. \u201cDo you have some opinions on climate change that you\u2019ve thought about?\u201d Mr Kennedy asked. Judge Barrett replied: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m certainly not a scientist.\u201d When asked to expand on her answer, she continued: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve read things about climate change. I would not say that I have firm views on it.\u201d The well-worn Republican talking point of \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist\u201d has allowed a host of elected officials to equivocate on the scientific consensus on climate change, despite  polls that show  most Americans accept the  reality of the crisis  and want the government to take action. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, \u00a0Florida Governor\u00a0Rick Scott,\u00a0and former House Speaker John Boehner, all have all made similar \u201cnot a scientist\u201d pitches when asked about the climate crisis. Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist, previously told the  New York Times  that it was \u201cthe dumbest answer I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. \u00a0He added: \u201cUsing that logic would disqualify politicians from voting on anything. Most politicians aren\u2019t scientists, but they vote on science policy. They have opinions on Ebola, but they\u2019re not epidemiologists. They shape highway and infrastructure laws, but they\u2019re not engineers.\u201d Judge Barrett has a  slim judiciary record  on environmental issues, and a question on climate change did not come up after she was nominated to the US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit by President Trump in 2017. The judge\u2019s conservative views are at odds with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal icon who she will replace. She would be Mr Trump\u2019s third justice and her ascension is expected to tip the court 6-3 to the right.\u00a0 AP contributed to this report Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The findings come as  Climate Week  kicked off on Monday and leaders prepare to meet at the UN General Assembly to discuss global challenges, including the climate crisis. The report,  Confronting Carbon Inequality , found that from 1990 until 2015:\u00a0 - \u00a0The wealthiest 10 per cent, around 630 million people, \u00a0were responsible for more than half (52 percent) of CO2 emissions - The richest one per cent accounted for 15 percent of emissions \u2013 more than double that of the poorest half of the world (7 per cent) - The richest 10 per cent are responsible for one-third of CO2 emissions that scientists estimate will cause 1.5C of global temperature rise, contributing to catastrophic climate change\u00a0 - The poorest half of humanity is behind just 4 per cent of CO2 emissions. With the world currently experiencing 1C of global heating, 2020 has been a year of climate extremes.\u00a0 The Indian subcontinent has been lashed with devastating cyclones and torrential monsoon rains. One climate expert told  The Independent  that the \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the climate crisis was in the disasters. Historic wildfires , driven in part by conditions caused by climate change, are raging across the American West. The global climate report from US federal agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found last week, that this year was the hottest summer since records began in the northern hemisphere. Although there was a lull in carbon emissions this year due to travel and industry slowdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, levels are already beginning to rebound as countries attempt to kickstart their economies. Scientists warn that the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to remain within the increasingly ambitious 1.5C of global warming set out by the 2016 Paris Climate Accords. Oxfam noted that carbon inequality is so stark that the emissions of just the richest 10 per cent would trigger catastrophic climate change by 2033, even if all other emissions were cut to zero. The charity is calling for an increase in wealth taxes and new carbon taxes on luxury items: Private jets, super yachts, carbon-intensive SUVs and frequent flights.\u00a0 The revenue generated should be invested in low-carbon jobs and green public transport while also helping poor communities mitigate the risks of climate change.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Because today is the release of the  Committee for Climate Change \u2019s annual progress report in which it details how the UK government has been performing over the past year. With the recent commitment to get the UK to  net-zero carbon by 2050  the stakes could not be higher. Because any delay towards this new much more ambitious target could leave us unable to catch up in the future. Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change shared his thoughts with me prior to the official release of the report. Chris has much to be proud of. The Committee represents the gold standard in advice on matters about climate change with its esteemed members producing outstanding reports, and was central to the UK government signing up to the 2050 commitment. But I have to say it\u2019s also at risk of completely wasting its time. Because with the current UK government at the helm, the combined 345 pages of it two reports published today could be summarised thus: we are screwed. The headline finding is that the government has implemented only one of the 25 recommendations that the Committee made in its previous report. But this is also a government that actively promotes fracking, lashes out millions of pounds on subsidies to enable the continued pumping of oil and gas from the North Sea and has recently overseen an  increase in VAT on some domestic solar installations  from 5 per cent to 20 per cent. They are far better at contributing to worsening climate change than they are at taking measures to tackle it, so it should be no surprise that they haven\u2019t taken the CCC\u2019s advice on board. Clearly part of the reason for the dysfunction is Brexit. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of meetings I\u2019ve had with people who simply tell me government can\u2019t consider climate change because of Brexit paralysis. But this government gives every indication it continues to be entirely bound by the iron law of perpetual economic growth and refuses to consider wider policy measures to avoid climate breakdown. The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty We shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the sudden interest in climate change as a consequence of Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunburg has not yet fully permeated the workings of the UK government.  Chancellor Hammond\u2019s recent letter  to prime minister May in which he highlighted the risks rapid decarbonisation would pose to economic growth is indicative of significant resistance across government to the measures that are required. But I\u2019m becoming increasingly sceptical that this government will ever have the ability to respond effectively. It seems unfair to single out the UK in this regard. At least it\u2019s trying. The Brazilian government is enthusiastically supporting the hacking down of great swathes of the Amazon rain forest, while the Australian government gives tax breaks to help unearth millions of tons of coal. Beyond the fact that I\u2019m not a citizen of these countries is the observation that centuries ago the UK led the world into the industrial revolution and so started our love affair with fossil fuels. It\u2019s ideally placed to take leadership in a new green revolution that would see the nation completely decarbonised well before 2050 and so demonstrate to everyone else just what is possible. It should see it as its historic duty. The risk with these annual reports is that it feeds a false narrative that the UK is blazing a trail to sustainability. It allows us to proudly proclaim how much we have achieved. But dig deeper and you will find that most progress has come from reductions in the energy sector which has switched from coal to gas and wind. Emissions from buildings were up 3 per cent on last year, with aviation seeing a 3.5 per cent increase. And today\u2019s report does nothing to address the embedded emissions of the products that come into the country that we enthusiastically continue to buy. The carbon emitted during the manufacturing of the laptops, phones, clothes and cars we import would increase our total emissions by 66 per cent. The report also makes clear the importance of negative emissions technologies \u2013 highly speculative processes that we hope will suck out millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere \u2013 because it concludes there is no credible or feasible plan for reducing all sources of emissions. An important reason for that is that aviation is set to increase such that by 2050 it will be responsible for 40 per cent of the UK\u2019s entire carbon emissions. It is apparently neither credible nor feasible to suggest that the wealthiest of society should take fewer flights. At a time when the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are losing billions of tons of ice, and heatwaves ravage entire regions of the planet, we must be radical. The earth system simply does not care for what some consider to be politically credible or feasible. I hope that the Committee on Climate Change in its next report takes a leap of faith and shows just what could be possible.

Professor Ed Hawkins designed the visualisation which has been used globally as a symbol for  climate change . Each line represents the average temperature in a year with blue-coloured lines indicating colder temperatures and red indicating warmer.  Professor Hawkins\u2019 told the BBC   that the colours of the graph will get darker and choices made at the  Cop26  summit will determine how dark it gets.  The graphic was first used by the Reading University professor at the Hay Festival in 2018. \u201cI was looking for a way of very simply communicating the fact that our planet is warming and so I made a set of stripes for Hay,\u201d the meteorologist said.  \u201cI could instantly see that members of the audience realised that something was happening and they could instantly visualise the fact that the planet was warming and that was affecting Hay itself.\u201d Warming stripes are now available for every country in the world showing how each nation\u2019s average temperature has changed over the years. The past 30 years have been the warmest on record, according to the warming stripes.  Warming stripes for Wales The warming stripes for Wales from 1884 to 2020 showed predominantly blue stripes between 1890 and 1980 but increasingly red and dark red thereafter.  \u201cThis information is critical for policymakers to make decisions. It indicates that Wales has warmed about 1.5 times faster than the global average,\u201d Professor Hawkins said. \u201cSo, for every two degrees [Celsius] increase in global temperature, Wales will rise by about three degrees.\u201d In efforts to reduce impacts of climate change, more than 100 nations will make a promise during Cop26 to stop deforestation and begin restoring the world\u2019s forests by 2030, the UK government has said. It\u2019s one of the first major international agreements of the landmark climate summit. India has set out a net-zero emissions target for 2070, the country\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has told the UN\u2019s Cop26 climate summit. India\u2019s 2070 deadline is 10 years later than China\u2019s 2060 goal, and 20 years behind the 2050 date the IPCC has said the world must hit to keep global average temperatures from soaring 1.5C above what they were in the pre-industrial era.

The appointment of  Ernesto Ara\u00fajo , who has been named by president-elect  Jair Bolsonaro  as the country\u2019s top diplomat, will be a major cause for concern for those already alarmed at the extent of global climate collapse. Brazil\u2019s outgoing government has already been heavily criticised for \u201cinviting deforestation\u201d, in the  Amazon  \u2013 the world\u2019s largest and most biodiverse rainforest, which is vital for soaking up carbon emissions. But under Mr Ara\u00fajo, it appears efforts to balance environmental protection and economic development may tilt further towards business interests. Writing  on his blog  during Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s election campaign last month, in a post titled \u201cHijack and pervert\u201d, Mr Ara\u00fajo described climate science as a \u201cdogma\u201d which ignored \u201cevidence\u201d showing the opposite of rising temperatures and greater concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. \u201cThe left has sequestered the environmental cause and perverted it to the point of paroxysm over the last 20 years with the ideology of climate change, climate change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe climate [scientists] gathered some data suggesting a correlation between rising temperatures with increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, ignored data suggesting the opposite, and created a \u201cscientific\u201d dogma that no one else can contest on pain of being excommunicated from good society.\u201d He added: \u201cThis dogma has served to justify an increase in the regulatory power of states over the economy and power of international institutions over national states and their populations, as well as to stifle economic growth in democratic capitalist countries and foster China's growth.\u201d Mr Ara\u00fajo\u2019s views closely echo those of Donald Trump, who has previously called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201ccon-job\u201d which was \u201ccreated by the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive\u201d. The 51-year-old, whose blog \u201cMetapolitics\u201d has the tagline \u201cagainst globalism\u201d, frequently rails against Marxism in his posts, attacks abortion, feminism, defends Catholicism and claims socialists are trying to criminalise history, Disney films, justice, WhatsApp, heterosexual sex, sport, jokes and humour. He describes Brazil\u2019s Worker\u2019s Party, known as the PT, and against whom Mr Bolsonaro was campaigning, as a \u201cTotalitarian Project or Tyranny Program\u201d. In another post he wrote: \u201cMarxist \u2018utopia\u2019 aims to eliminate all contradictions of human life, creating communist society and promoting the end of history. Yes, the end of history is a Marxist goal,\u201d the blog says in relation to Francis Fukuyama\u2019s book \u201cThe End of History\u201d, which states that liberal democracy will emerge as the triumphant form of governance.

The appointment will mark a stark change in Brazil\u2019s efforts to combat climate change. The country was the host of the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro which laid the foundations of international efforts to recognise and combat man-made climate change. Brazilian diplomats were also instrumental in forging the Paris Agreement in 2015. The country is in line to host next year\u2019s UN climate talks.

Scientists believe the information uncovered by studying ancient ice can help predict how the planet will continue to respond to rising temperatures. They also hope to discover what caused the planet to enter in and out of ice ages in the past.  It is part of a seven-year project which began in 2019 and will cost 11 million euros, funded by the European Commission. This particular campaign is set to end in January 2022.  It is coordinated by Carlo Barbante, director of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ISP) and professor at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice. It follows a previous project, ending in 2008, which saw scientists extract and analyse an 800,000-year-old ice core.  But how will this project help to predict the future of climate change, and would does it entail? Known as Beyond EPICA, the project also involves twelve international research institutes from around the world. An international team of glaciologists, engineers and technicians will work at an altitude of 3,233 metres above sea level, over 1,000 km away from the coast, and will experience average Antarctic summer temperatures of -35C. Once the drilling site was made fully operational, the system was tested and a temporary storage cave constructed in the snow to protect the first ice samples.  The team hopes to achieve an average coring rate of 170 metres per week. On Saturday, the team extracted their first firn core at the site. It is expected to take a total of six years to drill and analyse the ice.  A statement from Beyond EPICA said the seven-year project will see two decisive moments for the history of climate science. \u201cThe first, will be drilling the pilot hole from which the ice core will be extracted,\u201d it said. \u201cThe second, will be the extraction of the first layers of ice by the end of this campaign.\u201d The drilling site, Little Dome C, is an area of 10 km 2,  located 40km from the Italian-French Concordia Station, on the east Antarctic plateau. This is one of the most extreme places on the Earth: winters there are long and sunless and temperatures are usually the lowest on earth. Temperatures hardly rise above \u221225C (\u221213F) in summer and can fall below \u221280C (\u2212112F) in winter. The ice contains tiny air bubbles which reveal the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at the time they became trapped, such as methane and carbon dioxide. By analysing the ice, scientists will be able to look it how rising and falling temperatures impact the atmosphere, allowing them to \u201cgain a correct perspective on what the world is currently experiencing with climate change, and adopt suitable mitigating strategies,\u201d lead scientist Carlo Barbante said.  The last project which analysed 800,000-year-old ice, revealed that greenhouse gas concentrations went down during the ice age and began to rise as the climate began to warm,  Euro News  reported. It will also help scientists understand why climate cycles, which last around 100,000 years on average, used to be much shorter, causing the earth to dip in and out of ice ages at a much faster pace. Mr Barbante added: \u201cWe believe this ice core will give us information on the climate of the past and on the greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which happened between 900,000 and 1.2 million years ago. \u201cDuring this transition, climate periodicity between ice ages changed from 41,000 to 100,000 years: the reason why this happened is the mystery we hope to solve.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Rising global temperatures, largely due to man-made greenhouse gases, are the source of observable changes to the Earth Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Almost all scientists now agree that global climate change is caused by humans. In late September, the British government pledged \u00a35.8 billion ($8.8 billion) to tackle the problem in developing countries, and many other governments worldwide are also pouring money into solving the problem. A steadily-warming planet affects the environment in different ways. Rising global temperatures, largely due to man-made greenhouse gases, are the source of widely discussed, observable changes to the Earth, like melting glaciers, rising sea levels, warming oceans, and more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, forest fires, and floods. In the pictures that follow, we take a look at how climate-change-related events have affected regions around the world, whether directly or indirectly. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK BEFORE: Healthy pine trees stretch for tens of millions of acres in the northwestern US and western Canada. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK NOW: A hillside of dead pine trees killed by mountain pine beetles shows the effects of warming temperatures in the mountain ranges. In the past, freezing temperatures reduced insect populations. The beetles are now able to survive the milder winters, leading to devastating infestations. THE GREAT BARRIER REEF BEFORE: Considered one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world, Australia's Great Barrier Reef covers around 135,000 square miles, or an area that's nearly the size of Texas. Ocean acidification and temperature increases from climate change are the reef's biggest long-term threat. THE GREAT BARRIER REEF NOW: Warmer water temperatures trigger widespread coral bleaching, when coral turns white and is more susceptible to death. Coral is vital to supporting ocean life. THE DANUBE RIVER BEFORE: The Danube, Europe's second-longest river, flows eastward from its source in Germany to the Black Sea in Romania. The Danube River basin is critical to supporting industry, transport, agriculture, and fishing. THE DANUBE RIVER NOW: Between 2011 and 2012, a persistent drought led to record-low water levels along the Danube, stranding boats and paralyzing parts of the busy waterway. THE ALPS BEFORE: Matterhorn, one of Europe's tallest peaks in the Alps on the border between Italy and Switzerland, is pictured with a blanket of snow and ice August 16, 1960. THE ALPS NOW: The Swiss peak, pictured August 18, 2005, is eroding as a result of melting glacier water at the summit. The water sinks into cracks and creates bigger fissures after several cycles of freezing and thawing. The disintegration of Matterhorn is anecdotal of the effects of climate change in most of the Alps. MUIR GLACIER BEFORE: A late-19th century photograph of Alaska's Muir Glacier shows many icebergs \u2014 some nearly 7 feet wide \u2014 in the foreground. MUIR GLACIER NOW: By 2005, Muir Glacier had retreated more than 31 miles. Although this picture was taken from the same location as the early black-and-white photograph, the glacier is out of view. There's an abundance of vegetation looking to the west, and the beach in the foreground is now covered by pebbles, which came from sediment deposited by Muir Glacier and by melting icebergs on the ground. LAKE CHAD BEFORE: Africa's Lake Chad, pictured in the 1930s, was once the world's sixth-largest lake. It provided water to at least 20 million people in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger. LAKE CHAD NOW: The lake has lost about 80% of its surface area since the 1960s, a combined effect of irrigation, the damming of rivers, and global warming. SAN BLAS ARCHIPELAGO BEFORE: The San Blas islands in Panama are home to the Guna people. Their traditional thatched-roof houses and ancient way of life are being threatened by climate change. SAN BLAS ARCHIPELAGO NOW: The Caribbean island communities are flooded for several days every rainy season as a result of rising ocean levels caused by global warming. In the foreground, a traffic sign reading \"Slow Down\" is partially submerged. CORAL REEFS BEFORE: Corals seen in Dibba, on the east coast of the northern United Arab Emirates, are healthy and teeming with fish in 2004. CORAL REEFS NOW: The reef was devastated in 2008 by harmful algae blooms known as red tide, potentially linked, in part, to increased greenhouse gases and rising ocean temperatures. The tide kills sea life by depleting the oxygen in the water. WHITBY HARBOUR BEFORE: Whitby, in northern England, was once a busy fishing town packed with boats, fish sellers, and tourists. WHITBY HARBOUR NOW: The port is quiet, flanked by empty pots and nets and dried-out fishing boats as global warming has pushed fish stocks northward. Only about 200 fishermen remain in Whitby. CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS 2003: An infrared image from July 2003 shows the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. The red areas indicate that carbon-dioxide concentration is at or above 380 parts per million. CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS 2007: The same image of the globe, taken three years later in July 2007, shows that atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels are rising. The color bar used for 2003 had to be adjusted to account for the increase in carbon dioxide around the globe. Otherwise, the \"2007 map would be saturated with reddish colors, and the fine structure of the distribution of carbon dioxide obscured,\" explains NASA. BONUS: These maps compare temperatures in each region of the world to what they were from 1951 to 1980. Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. If this persists, humans may have to move to Mars.

The renowned broadcaster's intervention comes after  he said on Wednesday  that humans have \u201coverrun the planet\u201d in a trailer for a forthcoming film on his career as a naturalist. \u201cWe have been putting things off year after year. We have been raising targets and saying: \u2018Oh well, if we do it within the next 20 years,\u2019\u201d Sir David told the BBC. \u201cThe moment of crisis has come. We can no longer prevaricate.\u201d He called for governments to act urgently on the scientific consensus around the risks posed by another decade of inaction, saying: \u201cWe have to change, not by appeals to different kinds of optimism but to deliberate, compelling life or death decisions.\u201d Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Sir David said he had noted a \u201chuge change\u201d in public opinion on the issue, especially among young people, which he hoped would force governments to take action. A recent Ipsos MORI poll showed 85 per cent of British adults are concerned about climate change \u2013 up from 60 per cent in 2013 \u2013 with 52 per cent very concerned. \u201cWe have to realise that this is not playing games,\u201d Sir David said. \u201cThis is not just having nice little debates and arguments and then coming away with a compromise. This is an urgent problem that has to be solved.\u201d The broadcaster added that, with every year that passes, it becomes \u201cmore and more difficult\u201d to take effective action against the damaging effects of climate change. However, despite public interest, the response on the issue from the international community has been slow in recent years. The  United Nations \u2019 climate talks last year ended as a missed chance, according to the UN secretary general, because solutions for key questions were delayed due to disagreements between participants. \u201cThe international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,\u201d  Antonio Guterres  said. Delegates ultimately agreed to put improved carbon cutting plans on the table for the conference in  Glasgow  this year. Natural disasters such as the ongoing  Australian wildfire crisis  have shown the disastrous consequences of climate change, according to scientists. Richard Betts, a professor of geography at  University of Exeter , warned on Tuesday that the devastating crisis provides a sign of the future if action is not taken. \u201cWe are seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions in a 3C world,\u201d Mr Betts said. \u201cIt tells us what the future world might look like. This really brings home what climate change means.\u201d A landmark UN report last year warned that as many as one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction in the coming decades due to human activity. Sir David's comments came in a interview for BBC News to launch a year-long series of special coverage on the subject of climate change called \"Our Planet Matters\".

Led by Professor Nicholas Stern, who produced the groundbreaking Stern Report in 2006, and Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2001, the experts suggested a price for a tonne of carbon dioxide of $50 to $100 (\u00a339-78) by 2030. If implemented all over the world, the top price would raise about $4 trillion \u2013 more than the UK\u2019s and Germany\u2019s gross domestic products, but less than Japan\u2019s \u2013 although the report suggested poorer countries might charge less. Currently about 85 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions are not subject to a tax \u2013 while the fossil fuel sector receives subsidies of  up to an estimated $5.3 trillion . The world\u2019s largest carbon pricing scheme is in the EU, but it only charges about $6.70. The  High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices\u2019 report , which was supported by the World Bank and France, said the money raised could be used in a variety of ways \u2013 such as making payments directly to citizens. \u201cThe revenue can be used to foster growth in an equitable way, by returning the revenue as household rebates, supporting poorer sections of the population, managing transitional changes, investing in low-carbon infrastructure, and fostering technological change,\u201d they said. \u201cEnsuring revenue neutrality via transfers and reductions in other taxes could be a policy option.\u201d And the benefits would not simply come from reducing the risk of global warming hitting two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the point at which scientists believe it will get particularly dangerous \u2013 with the economists highlighting the benefits of cleaner air, reduced congestion and healthier ecosystems. The report described climate change as \u201can urgent and fundamental challenge\u201d. \u201cThe goal of stabilising the temperature increase well under 2C is largely motivated by concerns over the immense potential scale of economic, social, and ecological damages that could result from the failure to manage climate change effectively,\u201d it said. This would require the \u201clarge-scale transformation\u201d of human activities, affecting electricity generation, industrial processes, heating and cooling, transportation, agriculture and the way we live in general. \u201cHowever, climate policies, if well designed and implemented, are consistent with growth, development, and poverty reduction,\u201d the economists added. \u201cThe transition to a low-carbon economy is potentially a powerful, attractive, and sustainable growth story, marked by higher resilience, more innovation, more liveable cities, robust agriculture, and stronger ecosystems.\u201d The report called for the world to start cutting state subsidies for oil, coal and gas. \u201cReducing fossil fuel subsidies is another essential step toward carbon pricing \u2013 in effect, these subsidies are similar to a negative emissions price,\u201d it said. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan And the economists stressed the urgency of implementing their recommendations. \u201cAs carbon-pricing mechanisms take time to develop, countries should begin doing so immediately,\u201d they wrote.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come,\u2019 says researcher Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The Earth\u2019s oceans hit record high temperatures last year as the rate of global warming continued to accelerate, researchers have said. The rate of heat introduced to the planet\u2019s oceans over the last 25 years is equivalent to the energy produced by 3.6 billion atomic bombs, according to scientists. Climate change  has fuelled rapid rises in global surface air temperature since the 1950s, with 2016 the hottest year on record. A new study mapping the impact of warming on the oceans found waters in 2019 were at their hottest in recorded human history \u2013 increasing by 0.075C above the 1981-2010 average. Oceans provide a good picture of the planet\u2019s warming as they trap more than 90 per cent of the excess heat stored on Earth, scientists say.  \u201cThis measured ocean warming is irrefutable and is further proof of  global warming . There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat trapping gases to explain this heating,\u201d said Lijing Cheng, lead author of the study, published in the journal  Advances In Atmospheric Sciences . Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty To have increased to the level it has, the ocean will have absorbed 228,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (228 sextillion) joules of energy. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of zeros indeed,\u201d said Mr Cheng, associate professor with the International Centre for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \u201cThe amount of heat we have put in the world\u2019s oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions.\u201d Researchers assessed data from all available sources including 3,800 Argo floats across the planet\u2019s seas and oceans. Assessing the data with new methods of analysis to compare with heat trends stretching back as far as the 1950s, they found the last five years have been the warmest on record. \u201cIt is critical to understand how fast things are changing,\u201d said John Abraham, co-author and professor of mechanical engineering at the University of St Thomas in the United States. \u201cThe key to answering this question is in the oceans \u2013 that\u2019s where the vast majority of heat ends up. If you want to understand global warming, you have to measure ocean warming.\u201d He added: \u201cGlobal warming is real, and it\u2019s getting worse. And this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come. Fortunately, we can do something about it: We can use energy more wisely and we can diversify our energy sources. We have the power to reduce this problem.\u201d Alongside long-term trends, sudden bursts of warmth \u2013 such as a north Pacific heatwave from 2013 to 2015 dubbed \u201cthe blob\u201d by researchers \u2013 can have catastrophic effects on ocean  biodiversity . \u201cThe blob is documented to have caused major loss of  marine life , from phytoplankton to zooplankton to fish - including a 100 million cod \u2013 to marine animals, such as whales,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, co-author and senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in the United States. \u201cThese manifestations of global warming have major consequences.\u201d Researchers also warned hot spots in the oceans could have significant effects in storms \u2013 such as the heat in the Gulf of Mexico that helped to spawn Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, which both killed dozens of people. \u201cThe price we pay is the reduction of ocean-dissolved oxygen, the harmed marine lives, strengthening storms and reduced fisheries and ocean-related economies,\u201d Mr Cheng said. \u201cHowever, the more we reduce greenhouse gasses, the less the ocean will warm. Reduce, reuse and recycle and transferring to a clean energy society are still the major way forward.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Previous climate models may have been 'on the hot side' Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Computer modelling used a decade ago to predict how quickly global average temperatures would rise may have forecast too much warming, a study has found. The Earth warmed more slowly than the models forecast, meaning the planet has a slightly better chance of meeting the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, including limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Scientists said previous models may have been \u201con the hot side\u201d. The study, published this week in the journal  Nature Geoscience , does not play down the threat which climate change has to the environment, and maintains that major reductions in emissions must be attained. But the findings indicate the danger may not be as acute as was previously thought. Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford and one of the study\u2019s authors told  The Times : \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models. We haven\u2019t seen that in the observations.\u201d The original forecasts were based on twelve separate computer models made by universities and government institutes around the world, and were put together ten years ago, \u201cso it\u2019s not that surprising that it\u2019s starting to divert a little bit from observations\u201d, Professor Allen added. According to  The Times , another of the paper\u2019s authors, Michael Grubb, a professor of international energy and climate change at University College London, admitted his earlier forecasting models had overplayed how temperatures would rise. At the Paris climate summit in 2015, Professor Grubb said: \u201cAll the evidence from the past 15 years leads me to conclude that actually delivering 1.5C is simply incompatible with democracy.\u201d But speaking to  The Times  he said: \u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind, as [John Maynard] Keynes said. \u201cIt\u2019s still likely to be very difficult to achieve these kind of changes quickly enough but we are in a better place than I thought.\u201d Professor Grubb said the reassessment of the situation was good news for low-lying countries and island states in the Pacific, which would be swamped by sea-level rises if average temperatures rose by more than 1.5C. The previous scenario allowed for the planet to emit a total of 70 billion tonnes of Carbon after 2015, in order to keep temperature rises to just 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the reassessment allows for a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d of another 240bn tonnes of emissions before catastrophic damage is done. \u201cThat\u2019s about 20 years of emissions before temperatures are likely to cross 1.5C,\u201d Professor Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between being not doable and being just doable.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

With just over a month to go until election day, an average of 76 per cent of US adults expressed interest in news stories about the plans that President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden intend to deploy in response to the climate crisis. Maps were published last week based on a survey gauging Americans\u2019 interest in climate news by the  Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, . The data was compiled from a national survey of more than 5,700 respondents this summer.\u00a0 At a state level, interest in the presidential candidates\u2019 climate change policies was above the national average in certain regions, particularly in the northeast - New York (83 per cent), Massachusetts (83 per cent), New Jersey (80 per cent ) and Maryland (80 per cent). In the west, where states have suffered historic wildfires and soaring temperatures driven by the climate crisis, residents were also interested in the candidates\u2019 plans. In California, 80 per cent of respondents expressed interest, and 79 per cent in Oregon and Washington states.\u00a0 In the swing states which are likely to decide the next president, interest remained high on the candidates\u2019 climate plans but slightly dipped in those in the south.\u00a0 Arizona was two points off the national average (74 per cent) and the same in Florida. In Georgia, it was 73 per cent and slightly lower at 72 per cent in North Carolina. Wisconsin saw 75 per cent interest, rising by a percentage point in Michigan. Minnesota and Pennsylvania both tied with 77 per cent expressing in interest in new stories about the candidates\u2019 climate change policies. Climate change is only one of a number of pressing issues for Americans as they go to the ballot box this year.\u00a0 However a study by the  Pew Research Center  in April found that the number of Americans who say global climate change is a major threat to the country jumped from 44 per cent around a decade ago to 60 per cent in 2020.\u00a0 But the level of concern is split along party lines and mostly comes from Democrats while Republicans\u2019 views on the issue remain largely unchanged.\u00a0 The new Yale study also found that interest is high across the US for news stories on a variety of climate issues. On whether global warming is or is not happening - 74 per cent were interested and 25 per cent were not interested at all. (Some 97 per cent or more of climate scientists agree: climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities,  NASA  reports.)\u00a0 Some 77 per cent \u00a0said they would read news stories on the causes of global warming. According to the survey, 78 per cent were interested in the impacts of global warming on their local community, and the same percentage of people on the impacts of global warming around the world.\u00a0 The highest percentage of respondents (79 per cent) were interested in new stories about the response of the US government to global warming. For President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, the Republican party has recycled its 2016 platform that says the climate crisis will be best solved by the market and tech solutions. The GOP platform also states that \"climate change is far from this nation\u2019s most pressing national security issue. This is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\" The recycled platform underlines how much President Trump has achieved in curbing plans to tackle the crisis. The platform references plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and roll back aspects of the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. On these, Mr Trump made good on the promises. In mid-August, Mr Trump's re-election campaign posted his second-term agenda, titled \"Fighting for You!\" The brief document made no mention of the climate or environment but noted that: \"Over the coming weeks, the President will be sharing additional details about his plans through policy-focused speeches on the campaign trail.\" During a meeting earlier this month in California, Mr Trump made his feelings on climate change clear, telling public officials: \u201cIt'll start getting cooler. You just watch.\u201d In a rare public rebuke of a sitting president, one replied: \"I wish science agreed with you.\" Mr Trump shot back: \"Well, I don't think science knows actually.\" In July, Joe Biden released a $2 trillion plan to tackle the climate crisis, with aims to boost investment in clean energy and wind down fossil-fuel power plants by 2035.

Teams of specialists have assessed the scale of the dangers to human health when changes in the climate lead to higher incidences of weather extremes, such as high temperatures, floods and drought. The findings - published today in the journal Nature - come weeks before world leaders meet in Montreal to discuss climate change at the first Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Global warming is likely to lead to an increase in the number of infectious diseases and respiratory illnesses. It will also raise the risk and severity of flooding, and reduce the availability of clean drinking water to millions of people. The studies also found that the countries most likely to be affected by global warming were those least able to combat its effects. Meanwhile, the nations who contribute most to climate change are those that will suffer the least. Professor Jonathan Patz of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the lead author of one of the studies, said that it was incumbent on those countries bearing the greatest responsibility for climate change to show moral leadership. He said: \"Those least able to cope and least responsible for the greenhouse gases that cause global warming are most affected. Herein likes an enormous global ethical challenge.\" The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that changes to the earth's climate was already causing about five million extra cases of severe illness a year and more than 150,000 extra deaths. By 2030, however, the number of climate-related diseases was likely to more than double, with a dramatic increase in heat-related deaths caused by heart failure, respiratory disorders, the spread of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Countries with coastlines along the Indian and Pacific Oceans and sub-Saharan Africa would suffer a disproportionate share of the extra health burden, said Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, of the WHO, who took part in the latest study. \"Many of the most important diseases in poor countries, such as diarrhoea and malnutrition, are highly sensitive to climate,\" Dr Campbell-Lendrum said. \"The health sector is already struggling to control these diseases and climate change threatens to undermine these efforts,\" he said. Scientists estimate that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to lead to increases in global average temperatures of between 1.4C and 5.8C by the end of the century. The number of people at risk of flooding by coastal storm surges is projected to increase from the current 75 million to 200 million by 2080, when sea levels may have risen by 40 centimetres. A separate study of how rising temperatures will affect water supplies found that severe shortages were likely to affect up to a sixth of the world's population who currently rely on melting snow and glacial \"fossil\" ice. Parts of China and India, where vast population centres rely on melting ice from the Himalayas for their supply of drinking water, are highly vulnerable to global warming, the study found. People living west of the Andes are also likely to suffer from a dwindling water supply once the glaciers have disappeared, the study found. Peru had already suffered a 25 per cent reduction in water supplies over the past 30 years. \"Climate warming is a certainty and the bottom line in this analysis is that the impact of warming and the long-term prognosis is clear and very dire,\" said Tim Barnett of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. \"It's especially clear that regions in Asia and South America are headed for a water-supply crisis because once that fossil water has gone, it's gone.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The Liangzhu exploration site, about 160km southwest of  Shanghai , was home to an advanced ancient city with an elaborate water management system, and the oldest known use of large hydraulic engineering structures in  China , the researchers, including those from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said. Previous  archaeological studies  have shown that this walled city had a system of navigable canals, dams, and water reservoirs, which made it possible to cultivate large agricultural areas throughout the year.  The Liangzhu ancient city, declared a  Unesco World Heritage Site in 2019 , is one of the first examples of highly developed communities based on water infrastructure in the history of human civilisation. The city\u2019s ruins also show evidence that it was culturally and technologically advanced for the period, particularly in agriculture and aquaculture. But it was mysteriously abandoned, and the culture collapsed about 4,300 years ago.  In the research  published in the journal  Science Advances  on Wednesday, scientists assessed ancient climate records in geological samples such as dripstones, as well as archeological data from the site. They found that the Liangzhu culture collapsed \u201cwithin a short and anomalous wet period between 4,345 \u00b1 32 and 4,324 \u00b1 30 years ago.\u201d To reconstruct the ancient climate history of the area, the scientists took samples of cave rocks called stalagmites from the two caves Shennong and Jiulong, which are located southwest of the excavation site.  Dripstones of caves near the Liangzhu site provide an accurate glimpse into the time of the ancient culture\u2019s collapse about 4,300 years ago \u201cThese caves have been well explored for years. They are located in the same area affected by the Southeast Asian monsoon as the Yangtze delta and their stalagmites provide a precise insight into the time of the collapse of the Liangzhu culture, which, according to archaeological findings, happened about 4,300 years ago,\u201d Christoph Sp\u00f6tl, a co-author of the study from the University of Innsbruck in Austria, explained. Based on their analysis of the stalagmite samples, the scientists say, there was a period of extremely high precipitation between 4,345 and 4,324 years ago. \u201cThis is amazingly precise in light of the temporal dimension,\u201d Dr Sp\u00f6tl said. \u201cA thin layer of clay was found on the preserved ruins, which points to a possible connection between the demise of the advanced civilisation and floods of the Yangtze River or floods from the East China Sea. No evidence could be found for human causes such as warlike conflicts.\u201d  The researchers believe the massive anomalous monsoon rains may have led to severe flooding of the Yangtze and its branches that even the sophisticated dams and canals of the time could not withstand \u2013 destroying Liangzhu City and forcing people to flee.  \u201cThe very humid climatic conditions continued intermittently for another 300 years, as the geologists show from the cave data,\u201d the scientists added. While the findings support the hypothesis that the city was abandoned after large-scale flooding and inundation, researchers said further studies were needed to confirm the cause of the civilization\u2019s collapse.

Speaking from London, the prime minister said he was urging world leaders to show the \u201ccourage\u201d to secure a deal which could put the world on a track to limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But his call for them to sign off the draft agreement published early on Friday is a clear indication that he has given up hope of achieving any further improvements on a text which has been criticised by climate activists as too weak. \u201cWhat everybody needs to do now is recognise that we really are in the final furlong, and it\u2019s in the final furlong where the horses change places,\u201d said Mr Johnson. \u201cWhat needs to happen now is that people need to understand that the deal that\u2019s on the table - the so-called cover decision - that is the text. \u201cWe either find a way of agreeing it or I\u2019m afraid we risk blowing it. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d Following phone talks with leaders of Italy and Egypt, Mr Johnson said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to world leaders in all my conversations is \u2018This is the moment - tell your negotiating teams how important this is.  \u201c\u2019Tell them to have the conviction and the courage to come together and agree that cover decision because people are watching this around the world. It\u2019s a moment of massive choice for the world\u2019.\u201d It was time for rich nations to commit to increase donations to help the developing world cut emissions and make necessary adaptations to deal with the extreme weather caused by higher temperatures, he said. Pledges made at the Copenhagen summit in 2009 to deliver $100bn a year have still not been met, with the target unlikely to be hit until three years late in 2023. \u201cWe do need to see the cash on the table to help the developing world to make the\u00a0 changes that are necessary,\u201d said Mr Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s what needs to happen in the next few hours. \u201cPeople need to see that there\u2019s enough cash to make a start, there\u2019s enough commitments to make a start and that if they can have the courage to do this deal - to agree the cover decision that\u2019s on the table today - then we will have that roadmap that will enable us to go forward and start to remove the threat of anthropogenic  climate change .\u201d EPA PA Getty AFP\/Getty Getty PA Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty The PM said it had been clear all along that it would not be possible to reach an agreement at Glasgow that would ensure global warming does not cross the 1.5C threshold, which experts believe will allow the world to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. World leaders will have to come back with further commitments at future summits, he said. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stop global warming at Glasgow - we can\u2019t, we\u2019ve got to accept that,\u201d saidMr Johnson. \u201cWhat we can do is keep alive the prospect of restraining the increase in the planet\u2019s temperatures to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. \u201cNow, even an increase of 1.5 degrees is going to have some pretty big consequences for the environment and for human beings. But it\u2019s much, much better than allowing temperatures to increase by two degrees or more. \u201cWhat we can still achieve at Cop in Glasgow is keep alive that prospect.\u201d  Mr Johnson has faced criticism from Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Labour Cop26 spokesperson Ed Miliband for staying away from Glasgow as the crucial United Nations conference enters its final straight. But he brushed off suggestions that he should have returned to the summit after his three-hour visit on Wednesday, saying only: \u201cI can absolutely promise you we\u2019ve been shifting heaven and earth to try and get all our friends, our acquaintances around the world\u00a0 - everybody -\u00a0 to see the vital importance of this agreement in Glasgow.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Johan Rockstr\u00f6m shocked environmentalists in 2009 when he identified nine categories of Nature that were essential for life as we know it, and warned that we had already crossed into dangerous territory on three of them \u2013 including climate change. Rockstr\u00f6m, an environmental science professor at Stockholm University and executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, has since transferred a fourth category, deforestation, to his list of \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d in the danger zone, which threaten irreversible, devastating consequences to the planet. But he has had a dramatic change of heart over global warming, and is more optimistic that the worst of the threat can be contained than he has been since 1992. In the danger zone Other risks to life His optimism is founded on the breakneck speed of innovation in wind and solar power in the past two to three years, which means that renewable energy is being deployed on a massive scale and, crucially, at a cost roughly comparable to fossil fuels. Only last week new figures showed that the cost of electricity produced by onshore windfarms in the UK has fallen so much that for the first time it is now cheaper than fossil-fuel energy.  Rapid improvements in energy efficiency are also key, along with a drive to reduce waste and increase the volume of recycled materials used in manufacturing, he says. These developments have effectively removed the last major impediment to dramatically reducing greenhouse gases, raising the prospect that even though the planetary boundary has been crossed on global warming, the world may be able to cross back again. AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters PA EPA \u201cWe have a paradox unique to our era. On a scientific basis there is more reason to be nervous than ever before. But at the same time there has never before been so much reason for hope,\u201d Professor Rockstr\u00f6m told The Independent on Sunday. \u201cThe last time I was as optimistic was in 1992, with the Rio conference .... Then we lost 20 years. Now we\u2019re back on a much more hopeful path,\u201d he said. Professor Rockstr\u00f6m is referring to the United Nations meeting in Rio de Janeiro at which world leaders agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level that would prevent dangerous climate change and set up a framework to do this.  Each year, 192 officials from around the world attend such a summit, often with disappointing results. This year\u2019s event in Paris in December is billed as the most important ever, because world leaders have pledged to agree emissions cuts and other actions that will put the world on a pathway that will eventually limit global warming to 2C. In advance, countries have said how much they are prepared to cut emissions by 2030. While these cuts in themselves fall short of what is needed, the professor is hopeful a more comprehensive deal, involving further cuts beyond 2030, can be struck in Paris \u2013 meaning the summit will achieve its goal. He says the situation regarding climate change is similar to that facing the stratospheric ozone layer, which protects us from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation, towards the end of last century. This was being so badly depleted by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in fridges and aerosols that the world had crossed \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d, threatening to dramatically increase cases of skin cancer. Then a cheaper alternative to CFCs was invented, the 1987 Montreal Protocol banned CFC use and the ozone layer recovered. But Professor Rockstr\u00f6m warns:\u201cThe negatives remain. The world\u2019s coral reefs are so worryingly close to collapse, while the Arctic and Antarctic are deteriorating so rapidly they could hit tipping points that are irreversible ... it\u2019s now or never towards tipping the world to a very costly, very devastating future, versus tipping ourselves towards a sustainable future.  \u201cI take a sober, optimistic view.\u201d   Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The experts from UK universities and research bodies praise the UK\u2019s international role in tackling climate change but say Mr Trump\u2019s visit is incompatible with it while he is undermining US and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It reads: \u201cThe president\u2019s refusal to tackle climate change, and particularly his initiation of the withdrawal of the  United States  from the  Paris Agreement , is increasing risks for lives and livelihoods in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.\u201d They urge the prime minister to tell Mr Trump to accept the scientific evidence of the threat of man-made climate change; support policies in the US to reduce  greenhouse gases  to zero by 2050 and collaborate with international efforts to combat climate change. AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty The president has previously called climate chaos a \u201cChinese hoax\u201d and \u201cb******t\u201d. He has been a  strong supporter of fossil fuel industries , reversing environmental regulations on oil, gas and coal. After his own administration last year published a report on the dire effects of climate change compiled by 13 federal agencies,  he said he did not believe it .  Then six months ago, his administration  held an event promoting  the use of  fossil fuels  at a major UN climate summit.  Scientists on the  IPCC  have warned the world has just 12 years left to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C, beyond which they would rise exponentially, causing irreversible disaster. The Paris deal aims to limit rises to 2C, and to strive for 1.5C if possible. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, who coordinated the letter, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s refusal to accept and address global climate change is putting at risk lives and livelihoods of current and future generations in the UK. \u201cThe state visit is an opportunity for the prime minister to challenge the president\u2019s reckless approach and advance the UK\u2019s reputation as an international leader on climate change before she steps down as prime minister. \u201cThe special relationship between the UK and USA is meaningless if the government does not use it to confront the actions of a president that are a threat to UK citizens.\u201d Additonal reporting by the Press Association Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile For a section of the right-wing media, it was too good to miss, an opportunity to cast doubt on one of their favourite bugbears \u2013 climate change. A scientific study had estimated that there would still be a reasonable chance of restricting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century even if humans used the equivalent of current fossil fuel consumption for 20 years. The lead scientist involved in the research, Dr Richard Millar of Oxford University, in  an article on the Carbon Brief website  said this \u201cupdate\u201d on earlier estimates suggested that \u201cwe have a little more breathing space than previously thought\u201d to achieve the target to avoid dangerous global warming adopted by the Paris Agreement. But some found a rather different message in the  paper in the journal Nature Geoscience . \u201cFear of global warming is exaggerated, say scientists,\u201d  screamed an article on Mail Online . And the Conservative MP David Davies \u2013 not to be confused with Brexit Secretary David Davis \u2013  tweeted : \u201cWorld's scientists now being forced to admit they were wrong and sceptics like the Global Warming Policy Foundation were right all along.\u201d He actually included a link to  The Independent 's story , although his remark was very much his own spin on the subject and not reflected in the article. \u201cClimate models are \u2018wrong,\u2019\u201d  proclaimed the  Telegraph  on its front page . And  The Times'  front page  had scientists \u201cadmitting\u201d that the \u201cworld is warming slower than predicted\u201d. Curiously the Mail Online also  published another article about the same research  with a headline much more in keeping with the paper. \u201cWe CAN meet ambitious Paris climate change agreement goal to limit global temperatures rise to 1.5C by 2100 (but only if countries stop using coal),\u201d it said. You may be unsurprised to know they have done nothing of the sort.  In  a speech last year to a meeting of the Global Warming Policy Foundation  (GWPF), Matt Ridley, a hereditary peer and former chairman of the Northern Rock bank, laid out the \u2018sceptic\u2019 philosophy. Mainstream scientists had a \u201cvested interest in alarm\u201d that was making them exaggerate the risks of global warming, he claimed. And there was no need to worry because \u201cenvironment predictions of doom\u201d were \u201calways\u201d wrong. According to the GWPF\u2019s founder, former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, greenhouse gases produced by human activity  have caused the Earth\u2019s climate to get warmer . But he told a House of Lords committee that it would \u201ccrazy\u201d for the UK to try to do anything about this process, because our emissions account for just two per cent of the global total. The take-home message from all this can be summed up by one basic idea: keep on burning the fossil fuels. Dr Millar told  The Independent  he had noticed a problem with the media coverage of the research. \u201cThese headlines had a clear spin in what they were trying to put across, but the articles themselves were less bad,\u201d he said. The paper provides a new estimate of humanity\u2019s \u2018carbon budget\u2019 \u2013 the total amount of fossil fuels that can be burned before global warming would probably hit 1.5C. So far human influence has caused temperatures to warm by about 0.9C. The researchers concluded that total emissions of 200 gigatonnes of carbon \u2013 or 240 gigatonnes with significant amounts of climate mitigation \u2013 would probably produce less than 0.6C of warming, according to their analysis of climate models. Dr Millar said this budget represented about 20 years of emissions at the current rate, giving humanity more time than some other estimates and, therefore, a greater hope of meeting the Paris Agreement target. But he said a more sensible way of spending this budget would be to start making cuts now with a view to hitting a zero-carbon world in about 40 years.  And that, in sharp contrast to the sceptics, is the take-home message: start cutting greenhouse gases and a temperature increase that could lead to dangerous climate change can be avoided. Yes. Climate models incorporate the laws of physics to try to make sense of what is happening, but they will never be 100 per cent accurate.  \u201cAll models are wrong,\u201d goes a saying in science, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean they are not useful\u201d. As Dr Millar explained: \u201cBy definition, a model is not the real world \u2026 it\u2019s called a climate model for a reason. \u201cBut they can do an incredibly good job at capturing some incredibly complex physics.\u201d Scientists have produced estimates of how warm the world will get if the amount of carbon increases to double pre-industrial levels. This produces a range of results from about 1.5C to 5C. The lower end of the scale would be relatively benign; the upper end would result in the end of human civilisation as we know it. Those who say we will be fine make the same mistake as those who say we are heading for Armageddon \u2013 insisting on certainty when there is doubt. The question then is what is the wisest course? Roll the dice and hope for the best or make efforts to ensure the worst-case scenario does not happen?

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Experts say greenhouse gas emissions in China, the world\u2019s largest current contributor to climate change, are down 25 per cent\u00a0 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Humans have seemed unable to get a handle on  climate change , with global emissions of  greenhouse gases  continuing to grow every year. But a microscopic pathogen, so structurally simple that it does not even have a single cell and is arguably not even alive, may be capable of accomplishing what our political leaders thus far cannot. Experts say greenhouse gas emissions in  China , the world\u2019s largest current contributor to climate change, are down 25 per cent in recent weeks as the country conducted a massive societal intervention to stop the spread of the virus.  Air pollution  is also down, due to decreased driving and less coal burning. Meanwhile, as the virus enters a second phase, spreading beyond China to other countries, it is dampening global demand for oil and air travel, and threatening overall global economic growth. All of these are strongly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. While it\u2019s too early to say for sure, if these trends continue, the  coronavirus  could join rare company. Since the year 1900, greenhouse gas emissions have risen dramatically. During that period, the escalation of emissions has been nearly constant, with 2019 projected to set yet another record high. And when significant declines have happened, it\u2019s usually been because of sweeping economic contractions or large-scale geopolitical events such as the fall of the Soviet Union. When it comes to an emissions decline, \u201cwhatever the driver, it will have to be big, and global,\u201d says Glen Peters, an expert on carbon emissions at Norway\u2019s Centre for International Climate Research and a contributor to the Global Carbon Project. The last time global emissions fell noticeably was in the wake of the Great Recession, from 2008 to 2009 \u2013 when US GDP fell 4.3 per cent, unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 per cent, housing prices crashed and the stock market lost, at the nadir, more than half of its value. But even in that moment of economic and societal trauma, the global emissions decline was fleeting. Emissions started to rise again almost immediately. Still, if the current emissions contraction that happened first in China spreads around the world, and is sustained, then it might cause a similar impact. Elizabeth Economy, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the nation\u2019s emissions have increased every year for the past three until coronavirus paralysed entire regions. \u201cIf there is a bright side to the coronavirus,\u201d she says, \u201cit is that the drop in industrial production, manufacturing, and automobile use will produce a noticeable drop in CO2 emissions for at least the first two months of the year.\u201d Granted, the bounce back could be rapid if China tries to juice its economy through some type of stimulus once the situation stabilises. South Korea has already enacted roughly $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) in stimulus in the wake of the virus\u2019s spread, and Italy is planning an infusion of $8.4bn. \u201cThe reductions are substantial, but they are most certainly only temporary, and there will likely be a rebound effect,\u201d says Joanna Lewis, an expert on China\u2019s energy sector at Georgetown University. \u201cOnce people go back to work and factories restart, they may try to make up for lost time. This could result in a surge in emissions.\u201d Still, the change since the start of the year in the world\u2019s most greenhouse-gas-intensive economy has been striking to behold. Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, found that carbon emissions in China are down at least a quarter over the month of February. He estimates it amounts to a reduction of 200 million tons of carbon dioxide compared with emissions levels in 2019. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, or NO2 \u2013 which are produced by cars, trucks and energy-intensive industries \u2013 are down about 40 per cent during the same stretch, he found. In addition, small-particle air pollution also has fallen across the country. Reuters AFP via Getty EPA AFP via Getty Reuters Reuters EPA AFP via Getty Reuters EPA AFP via Getty Myllyvirta says that while emissions have rebounded a bit over the past week, \u201cit\u2019s still very far from normal levels\u201d. \u201cOil demand and demand for things like coal and steel have fallen,\u201d he says. \u201cThe impact on many of the major industrial sectors is very profound.\u201d He says sales of real estate are likely to fall sharply over the first quarter of the year in China. The outbreak will affect construction projects and investment decisions for months to come, all factors that could hinder economic growth and slow down emissions. The effects seen in China may ripple around the world. The International Air Transport Association recently announced that global January air travel, while still showing growth, saw \u201cthe lowest monthly increase since April 2010\u201d. And February\u2019s figures could be even worse. United Airlines recently announced plans to cut domestic flights by 10 per cent and international ones by 20 per cent for April and May. It\u2019s asking staff to volunteer for unpaid leaves to help adjust for the decline in revenue. Aircraft account for roughly 3 per cent of total US greenhouse gas emissions, so changes here could have a major impact. \u201cI expect where the coronavirus is going to be hitting is one of the more energy-intensive aspects of the economy, which is travel,\u201d says Kenneth Gillingham, a professor of economics at Yale University. \u201cI do expect emissions to decline,\u201d Gillingham adds. \u201cNot that I think that that is a particularly good thing in this context because the coronavirus is an absolute tragedy.\u201d Meanwhile, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and the International Energy Agency both recently lowered their forecasts for oil demand in 2020, thanks to coronavirus. On Thursday, Opec proposed cutting production by an additional 1.5 million barrels a day through the end of the year, which would be the biggest cut since the 2008 financial crisis. The OECD, meanwhile, said that in a scenario of broad global spread of the virus, economic growth could only tally 1.5 per cent in 2020, as opposed to a prior prediction of 3 per cent before the outbreak occurred. That itself is revealing, though, notes Peters from Norway\u2019s Centre for International Climate Research. \u201cIf global growth goes from 3 per cent to 1.5 per cent, then it is very low by historical standards, but nowhere near as low as negative growth from the financial crisis,\u201d Peters says. From 2008 to 2009, during that seismic economic event, global emissions declined about 1.4 per cent, according to figures from Peters and the Global Carbon Project. That\u2019s equivalent to a reduction of about 450 million tons of carbon dioxide. But then growth quickly resumed, and 2018\u2019s global emissions, nine years after that downturn in 2009, were 16 per cent higher. That\u2019s equivalent to an additional 5 billion tons of CO2 per year. The Global Carbon Project\u2019s data show even larger temporary declines, on a percentage basis, in the past during moments of global upheaval. Take the Great Depression \u2013 the longest-lasting and most severe economic decline affecting the United States and the world since 1900. US unemployment climbed as high as 25 per cent and thousands of banks failed. Global emissions, which were then far lower, dropped 25 per cent from 1929 to 1932 and did not exceed their 1929 levels again until 1937. There\u2019s also evidence of an emissions decline from 1918 to 1919, in the wake of the deadly  Spanish flu , the worst pandemic of the modern world \u2013 50 million people around the globe died. At least initially, this looks like a clear case of a biological event, rather than an economic, political or military one, driving down emissions \u2013 which shrank by more than 400 million tons of carbon dioxide in just one year. However, that period came in the immediate wake of the First World War, and it isn\u2019t clear that the decline was solely due to the pandemic. Emissions also fell as combatants laid down arms, explains Robbie Andrew, also a researcher at Norway\u2019s Centre for International Climate Research. Peace also brought an end to wartime spending and a contraction of the emission-intensive steel and arms industries. \u201cThe years immediately after the First World War are likely to show a combination of effects that overlapped,\u201d he says. Other episodes of emissions declining or flattening underscore that thus far in history, it has generally required a massive societal or economic upheaval for such a decline to occur. In October 1973, Opec retaliated against the United States for its role in the Arab-Israeli war, imposing an oil embargo. The oil cartel slashed production, quadrupling crude prices, fuelling inflation broadly, squeezing consumers and throwing the world into recession throughout 1974. It was then the deepest four-year downturn since the mid-1940s. And greenhouse gas emissions declined slightly for a few years. In 1978, another \u201coil shock\u201d, this time stemming from the Iranian Revolution and the drop in its oil output, badly hurt the global economy at the worst possible time. In the face of soaring inflation and the falling value of the dollar, the Federal Reserve slammed on the brakes, raising interest rates as high as 19 per cent in 1981. Inflation eased by the end of 1982. At the time, it was the most severe recession since the Great Depression. Emissions declined for three years and did not exceed their 1979 levels until six years later, in 1985. In the early 1990s, the world economy suffered from a US slowdown and the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2013 leading, once again, to a modest and temporary emissions decline. Myllyvirta says the parallels to past episodes when the world has seen its emissions fall are limited. A pandemic, after all, is hardly a humane, desirable or logical way to count on combating climate change. \u201cTo reduce emissions in a sustained way, you need the world to run in a clean way \u2013 and forever,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just lock everyone in their homes and say you shouldn\u2019t go to work.\u201d \u201cA complete switch from coal to low-carbon generation \u2013 or a modest carbon pricing policy \u2013 can provide emissions reduction on the same order of magnitude as a war, recession or pandemic,\u201d Gillingham added. \u201cThis provides at least a sliver of a reason for optimism.\u201d \u00a9\u200b  Washington Post Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile  The U.N.-appointed  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming. Here are five important takeaways. BLAMING HUMANS The report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil, wood and natural gas. Scientists  say that only a fraction of the temperature rise recorded since the 19th century can have come from natural forces. ___ PARIS GOALS Almost all countries have signed up to the 2015  Paris  climate accord that aims to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 by the year 2100, compared to the late 19th century.  The report's 200-plus authors looked at five scenarios and concluded that all will see the world cross the 1.5-degree threshold in the 2030s \u2014 sooner than in previous predictions. Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. ___ DIRE CONSEQUENCES The 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea level rise are already accelerating. Wild weather events \u2014 from storms to heat waves \u2014 are also expected to worsen and become more frequent. Because further warming is \u201clocked in\" due to the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere. That means even if emissions are drastically cut, some changes will be \u201cirreversible\" for centuries, the report said.  ___ SOME HOPE While many of the report\u2019s predictions paint a grim picture of humans' impact on the planet and the consequences that will have going forward, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, like catastrophic ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are \u201clow likelihood,\u201d though they cannot be ruled out. ___ THE IPCC The panel is composed of independent experts put forward by governments and organizations to provide the best possible scientific consensus on climate change. Scores  of scientists provide regular reports on a range of aspects of global warming that governments draw on when discussing what countries can contribute to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. ___ Read more of AP's climate coverage at http:\/\/www.apnews.com\/Climate Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The peat smolders at least four inches (10cm) underground, meaning that fires have the ability to survive autumn rains and freezing winters.\u00a0 Adding to the problem is that the peat bog is surrounded by hundreds of thousands of hectares of pine forests where conditions are now drier due to more frequent droughts. \u00a0Therefore if the \u201czombie fires\u201d are not extinguished, it can spark major grass fires in the spring and forest fires in summer. Grigory Kuksin, head of Greenpeace's wildfire unit in Russia, who has been fighting the zombie fires, described them as a \u201cclimate bomb\u201d to  AFP . Boreal forest, which wraps around high-latitude regions, peat bogs and tundra all have higher concentrations of carbon which spew vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere when burned. CO2 emissions drive the heating of the planet, which in turn makes the impacts of the climate crisis more frequent and severe, including droughts. Peatlands in the northern hemisphere store more carbon than all the world\u2019s rainforests combined. If they were to burn, the massive amounts of CO2 released into the atmosphere would immediately render all efforts to control emissions futile. \"We are fighting both against the result of climate change and the very thing that causes it,\" Mr Kuskin said.\u00a0 Tackling the fires is filthy work, the volunteers told the news agency, and more complex that fighting conventional forest fires. To extinguish a bog, it has to be flooded with water, and the soil mixed until it forms a liquid paste, Greenpeace coordinator Ekaterina Grudinina said. Then \u00a0the temperature is taken from the layer of peat underground. If the temperature remains too high, the volunteers begin the exhausting process again.\u00a0 This summer,  wildfires in the Arctic Circle  broke last year\u2019s carbon emissions record, according to the European Union\u2019s earth observation programme, as the region continues to deteriorate at a faster pace than the rest of the world.\u00a0 In June, Verkhoyansk, a city inside the Arctic Circle, hit 100F (38C), an unprecedented high. Some 19 million hectares, an area larger than Greece, have burned in Russia since the beginning of the year.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The heatwaves, droughts and other natural disasters expected to increase because of global warming are helping to push countries into armed conflict, particularly those already split along ethnic lines Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Heatwaves, droughts and other severe weather events are increasing the risk of wars breaking out across the world, scientists say they have proved. The researchers carried out a statistical analysis of the outbreak of armed conflicts and climate-related natural disasters between 1980 and 2010. Their findings \u2013 that nearly one in four conflicts in ethnically divided countries coincided with \u201cclimatic calamities\u201d \u2013 suggest that war should be added to the usual list of problems likely to be caused by global warming, such as sea level rise, crop failures, water shortages and floods. Environmentalists have warned that if temperatures rise significantly over the next century, large areas of the planet could become uninhabitable, forcing millions of people to migrate elsewhere and significantly increase the risk of conflicts breaking out. But the new research, by academics in Germany, found there was already a statistical link between outbreaks of widespread violence and extreme weather events. Dr Carl Schleussner, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: \u201cDevastating climate-related natural disasters have a disruptive potential that seems to play out in ethnically fractionalised societies in a particularly tragic way. \u201cClimate disasters are not directly triggering conflict outbreak, but may enhance the risk of a conflict breaking out which is rooted in context-specific circumstances. As intuitive as this might seem, we can now show this in a scientifically sound way.\u201d The idea of linking conflict to natural disasters has been controversial. Some previous studies which compared wars to temperature, for example, did not find a link. However for this study, described in a paper in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  journal, the researchers used data from international reinsurance firm Munich Re. This was then combined with information about conflicts and an index used to quantify how \u201cethnically fractionalised\u201d countries are. Globally, there was a nine per cent coincidence rate between the outbreak of armed conflicts and natural disasters like droughts and heatwaves. But, in countries that were deeply divided along ethnic lines, this rose to about 23 per cent. Dr Jonathan Donges, who co-wrote the paper about the study, said: \u201cWe've been surprised by the extent that results for ethnic fractionalised countries stick out, compared to other country features such as conflict history, poverty, or inequality. \u201cWe think that ethnic divides may serve as a predetermined conflict line when additional stressors like natural disasters kick in, making multi-ethnic countries particularly vulnerable to the effect of such disasters.\u201d The paper said many African and Central Asian countries were \u201camong the most fractionalised\u201d, making these areas \u201cpotential hot spots of armed-conflict outbreak risk\u201d. Climate models also suggest that these areas can expected \u201ca substantial increase in extreme event hazards\u201d. \u201cProjections of overall conflict risk up to 2050 \u2026 find these regions to be particularly endangered, which highlights the relevance of our findings in the wider context of conflict prevention and development,\u201d the paper says. \u201cRecent analyses of the societal consequences of droughts in Syria and Somalia indicate that such climatological events may have already contributed to armed conflict outbreaks or sustained conflicts in both countries. \u201cSimilarly, a prolonged drought might have contributed negatively to the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan.  \u201cFurther destabilisation of Northern Africa and the Levant may have widespread effects by triggering migration flows to neighbouring countries and remote migrant destinations such as the European Union.\u201d The paper stressed that the root cause of these conflicts were \u201ccase specific\u201d but cautioned that natural disasters had the potential \u201cto amplify already existing societal tensions and \u2026 thus to further destabilise several of the world\u2019s most conflict-prone regions\u201d.

But experts have said otherwise. Prof Chris Preist, a researcher of sustainability and computer systems, told  The Independent : \u201cPeople should not worry about their email footprint too much because they only have a small effect on it and it\u2019s a relatively small part of their own footprint.\u201d\u00a0 Meanwhile,  climate activists  rallied yesterday outside the Democrat\u2019s headquarters in Washington DC in protest of  Joe Biden \u2019s early hires of key staff with connections to the oil and gas industry. Politicians including  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  marched alongside protesters. AOC, as she is commonly called, said at the rally: \u201cWe\u2019re going to organise and demand that the Biden administration, which I believe is decent and kind and honourable, keep their promise.\u201d See below for our live coverage as it happened. Good morning, and welcome to  The Independent \u2019s rolling coverage of the climate crisis.\u00a0 The UK has been tasked with finding innovative ways to cut the nation\u2019s carbon emissions before Cop26 , which will be held in Glasgow next November, and the footprint left by web users is thought to be the focus of that endeavour.\u00a0 A study commissioned by energy company OVO at the end of 2019 found that if every adult in the UK sent one fewer \u201cthank you\u201d email a day the UK could save more than 16,433 tonnes of carbon a year \u2013 the equivalent to 81,152 flights to Madrid. The 10 most \u201cunnecessary\u201d emails OVO found were messages saying only \u201cthank you\u201d, \u201cappreciated\u201d, \u201ccheers\u201d and \u201cLOL\u201d. But scientists are not convinced this is the answer. \u201cPeople should not worry about their email footprint too much because they only have a small effect on it and it\u2019s a relatively small part of their own footprint,\u201d Prof Chris Preist, a researcher of sustainability and computer systems at the University of Bristol, told  The Independent \u2019s  Daisy Dunne  last night. Read her analysis in full here: Our individual choices about whether or not to send an email are unlikely to make much difference to our carbon footprints, scientists tell Daisy Dunne Sunrise Movement, the American youth-led organisation fighting for climate change to be taken seriously in government, led a rally yesterday outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC. \u00a0 The aim: to encourage Joe Biden to remember that their votes were what won him the White House, and not to recuit members into his adminsitration who have strong affiliations with anti-environemtnal organisation such as oil and gas giants.\u00a0 Politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman marched alongside protesters, calling for the president-elect to stick by the environmental pledges he made throughout his victorious campaign.\u00a0 AOC, as she is commonly called, said at the rally: \u201cWe\u2019re going to organise and demand that the Biden administration, which I believe is decent and kind and honourable, keep their promise.\u201d Ms Ocasio-Cortez also reminded Mr Biden that the climate emergency is a \u201ctop three issue\u201d and one that he must take seriously when he is sworn into office in January.\u00a0 Mr Biden has been on the receiving end of mass criticism after announcing some of his early hires, one of who is the Democratic Party\u2019s top recipient of fossil fuel industry money. Representative Cedric Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana, will lead the White House Office of Public Engagement, where Politico reports he is \u201cexpected to serve as a liaison with the business community and climate change activists\u201d. During his 10 years in Congress, Mr Richmond has received roughly $341,000 (\u00a3256,505) from donors in the oil and gas industry \u2014 the 5th highest total among House Democrats, according to reports in the Daily Poster. The sum includes corporate political action committee donations of $40,000 (\u00a330,089) from oil giant ExxonMobil. Mr Biden has promised a $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn) plan to combat climate change, and his making the climate crisis one of his campaign\u2019s top priorities is thought to be a major reason he won the presidential election. He is yet to comment on the backlash surrounding Mr Richmond\u2019s appointment. A global map of every species of bee has been created by scientists in an historic first step towards ensuring their proper conservation, according to a new study published on Thursday in the journal  Current Biology . It is thought more than 20,000 species of bee exist throughout the world and they are dying in huge numbers as a result of climate change, pesticide poisoning and plant loss. But until now, accurate information about the number of bee species and their activity around the world has been sparse - particularly in developing countries where records are hard to come by, the study said. Bees provide essential services to our ecosystems and are the major pollinators of many of our staple foods, Dr Alice Hughes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Yunnan told BBC News today. \u201cHere we combine millions of records to create the first maps of global bee richness, and understand why we see these patterns,\u201d Dr Hughes told the BBC. \u201cThese maps, and our framework, can then form the basis of future work, enabling us to better understand patterns of bee richness and ensure that they are effectively conserved into the future.\u201d Unlike other creatures, such as bird and mammals, more bee species are found in dry areas away from the poles than in tropical environments nearer the equator, the study concluded. There are more in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern, with hotspots in parts of the US, Africa and the Middle East. There are also fewer bee species in forests and jungles than in desert environments because trees provide fewer sources of food for bees than plants and flowers. A quick analysis of the details of Boris Johnson\u2019s climate action plan suggests that the new measures announced by the PM are not nearly ambitious enough to reach the government\u2019s near-term climate goals, or its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. \u201cThere\u2019s a gap between the government plans, even with this new set of proposals, and meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, and there\u2019s a second gap between the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and the path we would need to follow to hit net zero,\u201d Dr Simon Evans, deputy editor of the climate change website Carbon Brief, told  Daisy Dunne : Analysis of the government\u2019s own figures shows that new proposals will not cut emissions fast enough to reach the UK\u2019s climate goals. Daisy Dunne takes a closer look Dr Thomas Tanner, director of the Centre for Development, Environment and Policy at SOAS, University of London, told me this morning: \u201cOn the face of it, emails don\u2019t seem to be a major contributor to the climate crisis, but it becomes more important once you add in the contributions of every part of what makes that message possible, from the global data centres down to the home wifi. \u201cBut in reality it is that very infrastructure that should probably be the focus of our attention \u2013 how can we ensure that the kit, from laptops to server systems, lasts longer between upgrades? Global policy commitments to ensure durability and longevity of devices would be a welcome boost to the COP26 agenda. \u201cHowever, governments may feel fewer emails pushes at a more open door \u2013 most of us feel we have too many emails to deal with, so organisational policies and behavioural change that attempts to limit them can be good for our mental as well as planetary wellbeing.\u201d He finished by clarifying: \u201cThe primary concern to date has been on ensuring greener energy inputs to the process of building and powering kit. My argument is we need to think about the kit itself too.\u201d Surprising new research reveals some types of caterpillar can be \u201caggressive fighters\u201d as they seek to dominate their preferred food sources.\u00a0 Milkweed - also known as \u201cbutterfly flower\u201d in the US - is the monarch butterfly caterpillars\u2019 favourite food, but when there are shortages, these voracious green and black stripy larvae have no qualms about resorting to violence - mostly headbutting - in order to keep eating, finds  Harry Cockburn : Nothing stops voracious monarch butterflies in their race to consume the best leaves France\u2019s top administrative court has given the country\u2019s government a three-month deadline to show it is working to meet its commitments on climate change, in a ruling deemed \u201chistoric\u201d by campaigners.\u00a0 The Council of State, which rules on disputes over public policies, told the French government that \u201cwhile France has committed itself to reducing its emissions by 40 per cent in 2030 compared to 1990 levels, it has, in recent years, regularly exceeded the \u2018carbon budgets\u2019 it had set itself\u201d. The French government, famous for brokering the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, was also accused of deferring much of its reduction efforts beyond 2020 - under the guidance of Emmanuel Macron.\u00a0 Despite Mr Macron\u2019s 2017 promise to \u201cmake our planet great again\u201d, lauded as a swipe at climate denialist Donald Trump who vowed to \u201cmake America great again\u201d, France is far off track to meet its commitments under the 2015 treaty. The Council gave the government three months to justify \u201chow its refusal to take additional measures is compatible with the respect of the reduction path chosen in order to achieve the targets set for 2030\u201d. \u00a0The ruling means that \u201cpolicies must be more than nice commitments on paper,\u201d said one lawyer who called the move \u201chistoric\u201d. In an unusual move for the court, the Council of State published its decision both in English and French, thought to be a reflection of the global interest in the issue. Business groups and investors welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s green plan but \u00a0also questioned whether the prime minister has pledged enough money to make a serious contribution to tackling the climate emergency, reports  Ben Chapman : Aims of government\u2019s \u2018green industrial revolution\u2019 welcomed, but questions raised about the cash to back them up A bid has been launched to save one of England\u2019s rarest lichens by transferring it from a fallen oak to nearby trees using a risky translocation method, the National Trust has said. The lungwort lichen is a survivor of the ancient wildwood that grew in Britain after the last ice age, and its presence has traditionally been an indicator of a healthy woodland. But the frilly, greenish-gold lichen has become increasingly rare in England since the 18th century as a result of air pollution - which lichens are particularly sensitive to - and habitat loss. In the Lake District it exists in only a handful of sites, including on a veteran oak tree in Borrowdale which formed what is thought to be the single largest community of the species in England. The tree, thought to be between 200 and 300 years old, blew down in storms earlier this year and the lichen would die if it was left, conservationists said. A team has carefully removed a large patch of lungwort from the oak and reattached it to new trees using wire mesh, staples and eco-friendly glue, and rubbing its reproductive parts directly on bark in efforts to help it survive. It has been \"translocated\" to dozens of other trees across Borrowdale to give it the best chance of survival and it is hoped placing it high on trunks will give it the light it needs to establish and grow, and protect it from slugs and snails. The translocation method has worked for other lichen species but there has been a very low success rate for lungwort outside Scotland, the experts said. A previous attempt to translocate the species in the Lakes in the 1980s was only 1 per cent successful, but it is hoped this bid to move three square metres, with a total of more than 100 translocations, will fare better. Maurice Pankhurst, woodland ranger at the National Trust, told the PA news agency: \"The communities of lichens and bryophytes in Borrowdale is one of the finest in northern Europe. Just as an art gallery would protect their collection of fine and rare paintings, it's essential for us to protect these rare species.\u201d He said that while air pollution had long been a problem, the \u201cimpact of acid rain has [now] declined, [and] nitrogen pollution is now more of a problem, arising from increased road vehicles and intensive agriculture, which is having a huge impact on these Atlantic woodlands and the old growth lichens which need very clean air to thrive\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cThis is particularly pertinent after this summer when we witnessed increased numbers of visitors to the Lake District after lockdown restrictions eased,\u201d Mr Pankhurst added.\u00a0 The presence or absence of certain lichen can be used to indicate the health of the habitat they are found in and can act as an early warning of environmental changes, PA reports.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Early results from a 10-year study found that old oak forests can help to curb rising  CO2  levels by increasing the amount of the gas that they absorb. While increased CO2 absorption cannot extinguish all of the issues related to carbon emissions, the research adds to a body of work that can help guide climate policy in regard to the use of forests as carbon sinks.  In the ongoing experiment, 175-year-old oak trees in the Free-Air CO2 facility at the University of Birmingham Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR) in  Staffordshire  were bathed in carbon dioxide-enriched air and compared with a control group that were exposed only to atmospheric CO2. The level of CO2 used in the enriched air is 37 per cent higher than atmospheric levels and is intended to mimic levels of the gas projected to be seen in 2050. After three years, researchers have discovered that, under conditions of elevated CO2, mature oak trees can increase their rate of photosynthesis \u2013 converting carbon dioxide and water into sugar to use as food \u2013 by up to a third. Early research suggests that they do so by absorbing and storing more of the gas from the air. Previously, it had been thought that mature forests \u2013 those that have ceased growing vertically \u2013 could be stuck in a carbon absorption cycle, unable to change their rate of photosynthesis, but this study has shown that old trees can indeed learn new tricks. Doctoral researcher and lead author Anna Gardner said: \u201cThe data we have collected\u00a0is vital for modelling the carbon uptake of forests and has\u00a0furthered our understanding of forest responses to climate change\u201d. \u201cThis experiment studies the oldest of such trees that have ever been examined in this regard. And so, the data is an important contribution to climate change models.\u201d She added: \u201cThis data is the first piece of the jigsaw in helping us understand the role of mature forests in mitigating the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2.\u201d Professor Rob MacKenzie, the founding director of BIFoR said: \u201cWe are sure now that the old trees are responding to future carbon dioxide levels.\u201d He added that this research could be crucial in guiding climate policy moving forward. \u201cOf the prime minister\u2019s top four climate targets \u2013 coal, cars, cash, and trees \u2013 trees are, perhaps surprisingly, the least well-understood as a climate control lever. Our work adds to the small body of results from laboratories-in-the-forest that are essential to guide climate policy.\u201d Both researchers acknowledged that continued investigations were necessary to better understand how long the trees could store the additional carbon, and the effects on the entire forest ecosystem. Over the coming years of the investigation, leaves, wood, roots and soil will be assessed to determine how and where the additional carbon is stored, and how long it might remain in the forest.

A \u201cspeed limit\u201d on the rate of evolution means it will take at least 10 million years for the world\u2019s diversity to return to pre-human levels, according to a new study. Manmade  climate change  is decimating ecosystems and currently wiping species out at such a rate that scientists have concluded we are  living through the \u201csixth mass extinction\u201d . Previous mass extinctions have come about as a result of asteroids or periods of natural climate change, and researchers can learn about the future by looking for clues from these past events. In the new study, researchers used the remains of plankton called foraminifera, which are well-preserved throughout the fossil record, to measure the changes in species number and diversity over time. Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters REUTERS Reuters REUTERS Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters They assessed the stretch of time following the end of the Cretaceous period, when an asteroid is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs and much of life on Earth.  \u201cFrom this study, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that it\u2019s going to take an extremely long time \u2013 millions of years \u2013 to recovery from the extinction that we\u2019re causing through climate change and other methods,\u201d said Dr Andrew Fraass, of the University of Bristol, who co-authored the study. Like many other creatures, the foraminifera plankton were devastated by the asteroid strike, but the ones that survived bounced back fairly quickly. However, their group as a whole was a shadow of its former self, with far less diversity than existed before impact. It took millions of years for new characteristics to evolve so the plankton could spread out and fill every available space. Scientists have been aware of a lag in the replenishment of life following mass extinctions, but have tended to assume it was the result of lasting environmental effects.  The new research, published in the journal  Nature Ecology and Evolution , suggests it is the rate of evolution that is the limiting factor. \u201cWe see this in our study, but the implication should be that these same processes would be active in all other extinctions,\u201d said Dr Christopher Lower, from the University of Texas, who led the study. \u201cI think this is the likely explanation for the speed limit of recovery for everything.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile All around the world, people are experiencing more intense heatwaves and scorching temperatures every year.  Scientists say there is a clear link between these periods of abnormally hot weather and rising  greenhouse gas  emissions. Heatwaves from Japan to Europe to Australia have become more likely, intense and longer because of human-caused climate change,\u00a0 research shows . Scientists warn that, if countries and companies do not take drastic action to slash their emissions, the world will experience more frequent, intense and dangerous heatwaves. Climate change has likely doubled the probability of\u00a0 heatwaves , according to the\u00a0 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) . Since 1998, the area of land that has been impacted by more than 30 heatwaves per year\u00a0 has doubled . The impact is felt all around the world.\u00a0Global temperatures have risen around 1.1C above the pre-industrial era over the last five years. In Europe they have increased almost 2C, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (CS3). The continent experienced record-breaking temperatures in 2019, following a continuing trend of warming over four decades.\u00a0Eleven out of Europe\u2019s 12 hottest years to date\u00a0 have all occurred since 2000 . The Arctic is\u00a0 warming three times faster \u00a0than the global average. A record-breaking heatwave in Siberia last year would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change,\u00a0 according to scientists . Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and the polar ice caps are melting\u00a0 six times faster than they were in the 1990s , according to analysis by 90 polar scientists. The high melt rate fits with the worst-case scenario outlined by the IPCC, which states that sea levels will rise 17cm without sweeping reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, a quarter of the world\u2019s ocean surface experienced the longest and most intense marine heatwave on record.\u00a0 Scientists concluded \u00a0that the event was up to 50 times more likely due to climate change. A spike in sea temperatures\u00a0 triggered the latest mass bleaching event \u00a0of the Great Barrier Reef in 2020. All four mass bleaching events occurred during years when temperature records were broken - in 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020, analysis revealed. \u201cAs summers grow hotter and hotter, we no longer need an El Ni\u00f1o event to trigger mass bleaching at the scale of the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d lead researcher Professor Terry Hughes said, adding that the gap between bleaching events was shrinking, preventing a full recovery. By mid-century, extreme heatwaves could become the norm, scientists have warned. Last month, the\u00a0 Met Office warned that there was more than a 40 per cent chance \u00a0that the annual average global temperature will reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels at some point in the next five years. This puts the world over the critical threshold\u00a0which will precipitate the risk of extreme weather events and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. \u201cWe\u2019re already locked into more warmth, so we will endure more intense and more frequent heatwaves,\u201d\u00a0Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, told\u00a0 The Independent. \u201cHeatwaves will get much much worse unless we tackle the problem now. We have a short window to start making this happen, and we are not yet on the right path.\u201d With every degree celsius of global warming, heatwave days per season are projected to\u00a0 increase by up to 34 days , according to Tianyi Sun, a climate scientist from the Environmental Defense Fund.\u00a0The duration is projected to increase by 2-10 days for every degree, she said. Heatwaves have a severe impact on human health. Global warming from human activities caused more than a third of heat-related deaths around the world between 1991 and 2018, according to a study published in the\u00a0 journal Nature Climate Change . The European heatwave in 2003 \u00a0is estimated to have caused over 70,000 deaths. In Russia, a heatwave in 2010 caused more than\u00a0 56,000 excess deaths . Heat-related deaths in the UK are projected to treble by 2050 unless the government improves adaptation measures, a\u00a0 2018 report by the environmental audit committee \u00a0warned. Health experts said that the UK is failing to protect its vulnerable citizens from dangerous heatwaves by not taking measures to keep houses and care homes cool. During\u00a0the 2019 World Athletics Championship in Qatar, almost half the marathon-runners didn\u2019t finish due to the intense heat and humidity, despite the race being run at midnight.

But as the two-week summit enters its final day, there are fears that the agreement due to be sealed on Friday will not go far enough. So what is in the latest draft of the proposed agreement, released by the Cop26 presidency led by UK minister Alok Sharma at 7.14am after negotiations lasting late into the night? \u2022 The document voices \u201calarm and utmost concern\u201d that human activities have already caused around 1.1C of global warming and stresses the urgency of stepping up humanity\u2019s response in \u201cthis critical decade\u201d to 2030. \u2022 It reaffirms the goal of the Paris Agreement of 2015 to keep warming \u201cwell below\u201d 2C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C \u2013 requiring \u201crapid, deep, and sustained\u201d reductions of 45 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero \u201caround mid-century\u201d. \u2022 It calls on the near-200 countries represented at Glasgow to report back on progress towards more ambitious action at next year\u2019s Cop27 summit in  Egypt . However, there is no legal requirement on them to act. Instead, they are \u201crequested\u201d to do so, which UN lawyers regard as being stronger than being \u201curged\u201d, as an earlier draft on Wednesday did. \u2022\u00a0The document voices concern that rich world support for developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change remains \u201cinsufficient\u201d. It urges developed countries urgently to scale up their financial and technical support to help poorer states mitigate and adapt, going \u201csignificantly\u201d beyond the 2020 target of $100 billion annually \u2013 already set to be missed by three years.  EPA PA Getty AFP\/Getty Getty PA Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty \u2022 Crucially, the new draft maintains a commitment on fossil fuel use, despite efforts by oil and gas producing countries like Saudi Arabia to remove it from the text. However there are concerns that the promise in an earlier version to \u201caccelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel\u201d has been watered down. The text now includes a commitment to accelerate \u201cthe phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels\u201d. \u2022 Nations around the world are also called upon to \u201crapidly scale up clean power generation\u201d. \u2022\u00a0For the first time, the draft calls on states to consider action to cut non- carbon dioxide  greenhouse gases , such as  methane . This follows the focus on methane in Wednesday\u2019s US\/China declaration on bilateral co-operation in the battle against climate change. \u2022\u00a0Forests and other natural ecosystems capable of acting as carbon sinks should be \u201cprotected, conserved and restored\u201d, the draft says. \u2022 It calls on rich-world nations urgently to scale up financial, technical and capacity-building support for developing countries to deal with the loss and damage done to their societies by rising temperatures.

These measures would need to include ending the use of fossil fuels in the energy, building and transport sectors. \"The longer you wait, the more difficult it becomes,\" the report\u2019s lead author, John Christensen, said.

Last week, the UN published a separate report which found that countries were planning to  extract more than twice the amount of fossil fuels  from the ground than can be burned by 2030 if the 1.5C target is to be met. A study by the World Meteorological Organisation warned that levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases have  reached another record high , \u201cwith no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline\u201d.

And yet, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. At the end of last year, the government\u2019s official advisers on climate action, the  Climate Change Committee  (CCC),  published its sixth UK carbon budget . For the first time they included a report on the financing of the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The majority of the committee invited by the CCC to draft the report consisted of executives from major financial institutions, including HSBC, RBS, Aviva, Federated Hermes and Schroders. It beggars belief that the CCC should describe such executives as \u201cindependent\u201d. In an astonishing act of self-congratulation, the committee praised the efforts by HSBC and RBS, as well as other UK banks, including Barclays and the oil corporations  Shell  and BP, for commitments to move towards net zero. They neglected to mention that Barclays, HSBC and RBS have been among the top banks in the world for funding new fossil fuel projects.  Between them , Barclays, HSBC and RBS have invested a whopping $216bn in fossil fuels since the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. We  have written before  about the greenwashing buried in the UK oil corporations so called net-zero proposals for 2050. The report  also failed to mention  the estimated $200bn that Shell and BP are planning in new fossil fuel projects over the coming decade. By ironic coincidence, the  Financial Times  reported the same week that numerous senior renewable-energy executives were leaving Shell, reportedly due to dismay  at Shell\u2019s refusal to move fast enough away  from its lucrative fossil fuel operations. Do not get me wrong: it is hugely important that the CCC issue a report on how to finance the transition to a renewable energy economy. We  have criticised them previously  for not addressing the crucial role of the Bank of England and the UK\u2019s financial sector. And this report does include important recommendations on how the government could help mobilise the \u00a350bn in zero carbon investments needed according to the CCC report by 2030. But they almost all focus on how to enable private sector investments to be more secure in order to reduce their costs. They estimate that if the investments are considered to be risky, financing costs paid to the private finance sector could devour up to nearly 30 per cent of the billions being invested annually in the green transition. The CCC says that the vast majority of the money to be invested should come from the private for-profit sector. But at a time of historic low interest rates, it seems ludicrous to exclude low-cost UK government investments from having a major role in the transition. One of the biggest problems with the report is that, while it went into significant detail on how to mobilise profitable finance for the green transition, it failed miserably on setting out the detail on how to immobilise the dirty current lucrative high-carbon and fossil fuel investments.\r\n $2.75tn has been invested in new fossil fuel projects by  the global banks since Paris . Another $5tn was planned up to 2030, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. If we do not halt these genocidal investments, then the investments in the green economy will just cancel out the ongoing expansion in fossil fuels, leading to irreversible climate catastrophe. But the report does set out one hugely important principle on immobilising new fossil fuel investments. It recommends that the government should make net-zero targets mandatory for the banks and regulating this must be part of the Bank of England\u2019s core mandate. This is something this column has called for numerous times. The disastrous problem with the report\u2019s recommendation is that they set a target of net-zero financing for 2050. Thus, the banks would be free to continue investing & profiting from new fossil-fuel and high-carbon projects for another 30 years. This is totally in line with  the utterly unacceptable  declared net zero 2050 aims of the oil corporations and some banks. This would allow them to continue with a gradually declining destructive business-as-usual for decades to come. What the CCC should be calling for is an immediate ban on all new fossil fuel investments by the UK\u2019s banking institutions and for the UK to press for the inclusion of such a ban to be part of the COP26 declaration in Glasgow in 2021. The CCC must stop giving decision-making roles to executives from the fossil fuelled corporations. HSBC, RBS, Shell and Drax power station executives must be removed from such CCC roles. They are entitled to be official consultees but it is outrageous that the foxes are invited to oversee the rules for coop. On a positive note, the deputy chair of the CCC Lady Browne  did divest her shares in BP , two weeks after this column exposed that she was a shareholder last July. The CCC\u2019s work is too important for the future safety of the British public and nature, to be repeatedly enmeshed in damaging unnecessary conflicts of interests. The CCC were approached for comment but did not reply. The CCC should appoint a brand-new committee on Delivering a Net Zero Finance Sector and include at least one representative each from civil society and the NGO\u2019s specialising in decarbonisation of the financial sector. \u00a0 That way the public can have trust in the crucial work the nation is dependent on it to deliver.\r\n Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The BBC programme, broadcast in 2017, highlighted humanity\u2019s impact on the oceans and the growing problem of plastic pollution. It was credited with the \u201cBlue Planet effect,\u201d which saw people choosing to consume less plastic by opting for reusable items such as water bottles over single-use versions. However, an experiment by Imperial College London and the University of Oxford suggests that although watching the documentary increased environmental awareness in a group of volunteers, it did not translate into choosing to use fewer single-use plastics. First author Matilda Dunn, from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial, said: \"The findings from our experiment are counter to the popular idea that  Blue Planet II  reduced viewers' preference for plastic, instead demonstrating that human behaviors are complex and determined by more than just knowledge. The team split 150 people into two groups and asked them to complete questionnaire measuring their understanding of and attitudes towards marine conservation ideas. One group was then shown the original  The Blue Planet  documentary, which was broadcast in 2001 and contained no plastic or ocean conservation messages, while the other was shown  Blue Planet II . Both groups then filled out the same questionnaire. Before and after both showings, the participants were offered a choice of drinks and snacks which were either in paper or plastic packaging. The researchers controlled for other differences between the options, such as flavours or sizes of the snacks, such as by offering the same soft drinks in both plastic and paper cups. The study, \u00a0published in published in  Conservation Science and Practice , found that although watching  Blue Planet II  greatly increased the participants\u2019 understanding of marine conservation ideas, there was no significant difference in the choices people made between plastic and paper-packaged snacks. Co-author Dr. Morena Mills, from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial, said: \"Many previous studies of people's preference for plastic rely on individuals reporting their own preference, which can be unreliable. We are the first to use this type of experimental design along with measuring observed behaviors to test the hypothesis.\" The researchers are planning to use their evaluation method to test the effectiveness of other conservation-related mass media interventions.

Retired Admiral Paul Zukunft, who left his post in 2018, told  Politico  that Mr Trump had caused \u201cirrevocable\u201d damage to the environment. \u00a0The military leader pointed to the president\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which has been backed by almost every country in an effort to cut global emissions and curb temperature rise to well below 2C this century.\u00a0 Mr Trump can officially pull the US from the Paris deal if he wins re-election in November. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has vowed to rejoin the global agreement if he is elected to the White House. Adm. Zukunft told Politico that leaving the climate deal without another solution, along with other Trump policies, have damaged America\u2019s reputation on the world stage.\u00a0 He also described the Trump presidency as an \"insurgency\" on Americans' constitutional rights. \"I've seen an insurgency, if you will, on our constitutional rights and more power being centralized at the executive level that has really divided our nation. I am concerned that our constitutional rights are being infringed upon from within,' he told Politico. This week, President Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election in November drew rebukes from both sides of the aisle.\u00a0 High-ranking members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rejected Mr Trump\u2019s remarks after he said he\u2019ll \u201csee what happens\u201d before agreeing to the election results. The president has repeatedly made baseless allegations about the legitimacy of mail-in voting, and even told voters to cast their ballots twice, which is illegal.\u00a0 Adm. Zukunft was one of hundreds of officials who added their names to an  open letter , published on Thursday that read: \u201cWe are 489 retired Generals, Admirals, Senior Noncommissioned Officers, Ambassadors and Senior Civilian National Security Officials supporting Joe Biden for President.\u201d Also on the list is another senior military official who served the Trump administration. Retired Air Force General Paul Selva was the second-highest ranking officer in the military until he stepped down in August last year. Two defense secretaries, Ash Carter and Chuck Hagel, who served under President Obama as well as Eric Edelman, undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration, have added their names to the letter. The letter reads: \"We are former public servants who have devoted our careers, and in many cases risked our lives, for the United States. We are generals, admirals, senior noncommissioned officers, ambassadors, and senior civilian national security leaders. We are Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. We love our country.

In the most comprehensive assessment of how the climate has changed over the period to date, researchers looked at a host of sources of historic information, including tree rings, ice cores, lake and sea sediments, corals, mineral deposits and written records. What they found confirmed the famous \u201chockey stick\u201d graph, showing an undulating, but broadly flat, line followed by a sharp uptick that begins at around 1900. The only plausible explanation for this sudden change is fossil fuel emissions, which have increased the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from about 280 parts per million in the 19th century to more than 400 today. The warming effect was  predicted by the Nobel Prize-winning Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius  in 1895.  Writing in the journal  Scientific Data , a team of nearly 100 researchers described how they had created a database of 692 records from 648 different locations in \u201call continental regions and major ocean basins\u201d. Some of these natural thermometers covered the entire 2,000-year period, with an average length of 760 years. The original hockey stick graph, which spanned 1,000 years, was widely praised when it was  published in the journal  Nature  20 years ago , but also came under attack from climate change sceptics and deniers. Professor Michael Mann, one of the paper\u2019s authors, was abused, made the subject of hostile investigations by US politicians, and even sent death threats. In  a blog post about the new study , one of researchers, Professor Julien Emile-Geay, wrote that it essentially confirmed the hockey stick graph was accurate. \u201cAs a scientist, you have to go where the evidence takes you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can only be smacked in the face by evidence so many times and not see some kind of pattern. (You will never guess: a HOCKEY STICK!). \u201cThe hockey stick is alive and well. There is now so much data supporting this observation that it will take nothing short of a revolution of how we understand all paleoclimate proxies to overturn this pattern. So let me make this prediction: the hockey stick is here to stay.\u201d Mr Emile-Geay, of the University of Southern California, said any argument about the basic pattern of warming was over. \u201cIn the coming years and decades, the scientific community will flesh out many more details about the climate of the past 2,000 years, the interactions between temperature and drought, their regional and local expressions, their physical causes, their impact on human civilizations, and many other fascinating research questions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing won\u2019t change: the 20th century will stick out like a sore thumb. The present rate of warming and, very likely, the temperature levels are exceptional in the past 2,000 years, perhaps even longer. \u201cThe hockey stick is alive; long live the hockey stick. Climate denialists will have to find another excuse behind which to hide.\u201d While in the US there are leading politicians, including President Donald Trump and Lamar Smith, the chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 Science, Space and Technology Committee, who have claimed climate change is a hoax or a plot to create a world government, the UK\u2019s leading sceptics accept much of the scientific analysis of what has happened so far. Lord Nigel Lawson, the former Conservative cabinet minister and founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation,  told a House of Lords\u2019 committee hearing  that carbon dioxide was a greenhouse gas that was having \u201csome effect\u201d on the climate.  Instead, they tend to downplay the future effects with some describing themselves as \u201clukewarmists\u201d. Scientists say this makes the same mistake as those who confidently predict Armageddon. Instead, the  future is uncertain , with computer models based on the laws of physics predicting anything from a reasonably \u201clukewarm\u201d 1.5\u00b0C of warming to an \u201cend-of-civilisation-as-we-know it\u201d 5\u00b0C if carbon dioxide levels hit double the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan The Paris Agreement on climate change committed countries to trying to restrict global warming to below 2\u00b0C and as close to 1.5\u00b0C as possible. There has been nearly 1\u00b0C of warming attributed to human activity to date. Mr Mann said the new study was \u201cimpressive\u201d. \u201cThe end result of course isn\u2019t too surprising \u2013 they get a hockey stick-curve no matter how you slice the data,\u201d he wrote in a direct message on Twitter. \u201cAs if we needed it, [it is] further confirmatory evidence that the recent warming spike has no precedent as far back as we can go.  \u201cHuman activity is having an unprecedented impact on our climate.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

But they say massive emergency action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help slow down some of these processes, giving our species more time to adapt and stave off the worst-case scenario of a \u201chothouse\u201d Earth, in which our planet would be scarcely habitable. AFP\/Getty Alan Schaller Nasa\/Getty Ross Wills AP Reuters AFP\/Getty Art Wolfe \u201cA decade ago we identified a suite of potential tipping points in the Earth system, now we see evidence that over half of them have been activated,\u201d said lead author Professor Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the  University of Exeter . \u201cThe growing threat of rapid, irreversible changes means it is no longer responsible to wait and see. The situation is urgent and we need an emergency response.\u201d Co-author Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: \u201cIt is not only human pressures on Earth that continue rising to unprecedented levels. It is also that as science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming. \u201cThis is what we now start seeing, already at 1C global warming. \u201cScientifically, this provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency, to unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.\u201d At the moment our planet is on course for disaster \u2013 Even if all of the countries signed up to the Paris climate agreement met their emissions goals, we will still see \u201cat least 3C of global warming\u201d by the end of the century, scientists say. But we are not even on course to meet those objectives.  While we fail to deal with our emissions, the impact is still being felt and triggering irreversible processes. Permafrost across the  Arctic  is beginning to thaw on a large scale and release its colossal stores of carbon dioxide and methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas around 30 times more potent than CO2. The Amazon could also soon be beyond saving.  Deforestation , combined with  climate change , mean the \u201clungs of the world\u201d are close to a tipping point where the forest dries out and cannot survive. Since 1970, 17 per cent of the Amazon has been destroyed. This tipping point could be hit when deforestation reaches anywhere between 20-40 per cent.  In the Arctic, where temperatures are rising faster than other parts of the world, warming has already triggered large-scale insect disturbances and an increase in fires that have led to the dieback of North American boreal forests, \u201cpotentially turning some regions from a carbon sink to a carbon source\u201d, the authors write. Once a tipping point is hit, it makes the risk of others being hit considerably higher. But it could plausibly get far worse. Today, atmospheric CO2 is at levels last seen around four million years ago in the Pliocene epoch, when there were forests growing on Antarctica, sea levels were 20 metres higher than they are today, and global temperatures were 3-4C warmer. But our CO2 levels continue to spiral out of control, and, the scientists write, we are \u201crapidly heading towards levels last seen some 50 million years ago\u201d, in the Eocene epoch when temperatures were up to 14C higher than they were in pre-industrial times. The scientists are calling for the world to \u201cact now\u201d to put the brakes on in order to avoid runaway overheating.  Although future tipping points and the interplay between them is difficult to predict, the scientists argue: \u201cIf damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilization.\u201d The scientists are also calling for a greater understanding of how emissions increase the likelihood of causing tipping points to be reached. To have just a 50-50 chance of global average temperatures remaining 1.5C higher than in the pre-industrial era, the remaining \u201ccarbon budget\u201d is 500\u2009gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 emissions. As permafrost in the Arctic is already melting, the resultant emissions could take around 20 per cent (100\u2009Gt\u2009CO2) off this budget \u2013 and that\u2019s not even accounting for the impact of the methane which would be released. Amazon dieback could release another 90\u2009Gt\u2009CO2 and the loss of boreal forests a further 110\u2009Gt\u2009CO2. \u201cWith global total CO2 emissions still at more than 40\u2009Gt\u2009per year, the remaining budget could be all but erased already,\u201d the article says. A global departure from the fossil fuel economy is unlikely before 2050, but with the temperature already at 1.1\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, it is likely our planet will cross the 1.5C \u201cguardrail\u201d by 2040. The authors conclude this alone defines an emergency. \u201cNo amount of economic cost-benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem,\u201d the paper says. Professor Lenton added: \u201cWe might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points. \u201cHowever, the rate at which they progress, and therefore the risk they pose, can be reduced by cutting our emissions.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, there is a chance human-induced global warming could trigger other processes which will lead to uncontrollable warming, the team at the Stockholm Resilience Centre said.  As Amazon rainforest is destroyed, Arctic permafrost thaws and  Antarctic  sea ice melts, these natural feedback mechanisms that currently help store Earth\u2019s carbon will instead begin emitting it, scientists at the Swedish institute warned.  While it is unclear how likely this scenario is, experts agree that were it to happen the runaway warming after this tipping point would be an existential threat to humanity. \u201cThese tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes,\u201d said Professor Johan Rockstrom, Executive Director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. \u201cOnce one is pushed over, it pushes Earth towards another. It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over.\u201d The prospect of such a situation has been laid out by Professor Rockstrom and his colleagues in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  ( PNAS ). Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cWe address tipping elements in the planetary machinery that might, once a certain stress level has been passed, one by one change fundamentally, rapidly, and perhaps irreversibly,\u201d explained Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cThis cascade of events may tip the entire Earth system into a new mode of operation.\u201d Global average temperatures are currently 1C above pre-industrial levels and under the  Paris climate agreement  world governments have agreed to keep total warming below 2C. In the worst-case scenario, the researchers predict the Earth\u2019s climate would stabilise at around 4-5C higher \u2013 hotter than any point for 1.2 million years \u2013 and with sea level increase of up to 60m. \u201cPlaces on Earth will become uninhabitable if \u2018hothouse Earth\u2019 becomes the reality,\u201d Professor Rockstrom said.  Other scientists acknowledged the situation laid out in the new  PNAS  paper as uncertain, as it is somewhat speculative and not covered by most existing climate change predictions, but they nonetheless admitted it was plausible. \u201cIn the context of the  summer of 2018 , this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,\u201d said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia who was not involved in the work. Pointing out that evidence from geology shows Earth\u2019s climate system is \u201cinherently nervy\u201d, he said human processes to the mix could well exacerbate this. To avoid catastrophe, the researchers behind the new work said there was a need to move \u201cfrom exploitation to stewardship\u201d of the Earth, and not only reduce emissions but create new carbon stores \u2013 by planting forests, conserving biodiversity and creating technologies to remove carbon dioxide form the air. However, they noted that while their runaway threshold may well be within the Paris target of 2C, this could be a point beyond which the risk of hothouse Earth will increase sharply. As for whether staying below this target and maintaining a \u201cstabilised Earth\u201d is possible, climate scientists Professor Chris Rapley of University College London, who was also not involved in the study, did not have much hope. He said in the face of \u201cright wing populism\u201d and climate change denial, drastically tackling the problem in the ways described seemed highly unlikely. \u201cThe future habitability of the planet thus appears to rest on chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the sensitivity of the climate system to greenhouse gas emissions and other human disruptions is fortuitously very low \u2013 or that some other global scale social calamity dramatically reduces human emissions before any runaway planetary threshold is breached. The latter offers cold comfort.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

While climate change is causing many semi-dry regions of the world to become increasingly arid, it is making life more difficult for true deserts that have been in existence for thousands of years. Deserts account for up to 25 per cent of the Earth's land surface, are home to half a billion people and account for 12 per cent of the biodiversity \"hotspots\" - the richest areas in terms of rare animals and plants. Yet warmer temperatures and less predicable rainfall caused by climate change threatens to upset the delicate balance of desert life which has been honed by thousands of years of relative climatic stability. Meanwhile, the human exploitation of desert regions - resulting in the drainage of underground aquifers and soil poisoning through salinisation - is accelerating the rate at which deserts are drying out to the point of being killed off. Desert margins are particularly vulnerable and it is there that human settlements are most at risk of desertification, according the report by the United Nations Environment Programme. \"True deserts are not the final stage of a process of desertification,\" says the report, Global Deserts Outlook, published today. \"They are unique, highly adapted natural ecosystems, both providing life-supporting services on the planet and supporting human populations in much the same ways as in other ecosystems,\" the report says. Andrew Warren, a professor of geography at University College London and one of the report's lead authors, said that over the course of his 45-year career he has witnessed the growing threat to deserts. \"What alarms me now is that they are threatened as never before, by climate change, by over-exploitation of groundwater, salinisation and the extinction of wildlife,\" Professor Warren said. Desert animals at risk include the gazelle, the oryx, the addax, the Arabian tahr, the Barbary sheep and the Asian houbara bustard. \"We risk losing not only astounding landscapes and ancient cultures, but also some amazing wild species, which, may hold some keys to our survival,\" he said. \"Many have unique adaptations and genetic make-up which may contribute to new crops and livestock capable of coping with a rapidly warming world.\" The UNEP investigation found that climate change over the past 25 years has caused temperatures to rise faster than the global average in nine out of 12 major deserts studied. The study found that the projected temperature increases over the next 75 to 100 years range from 1C to 7C. Although a few deserts may experience more frequent pulses of heavy rainfall as a result of higher temperatures, many more are likely to become far more arid than they are today. Deserts fed by glacial meltwater - such as the Atacama and Monte Deserts in South America - will suffer most when their glaciers melt beyond a point that will cause rivers to run dry. \"Nearly half of the bird, mammal and butterfly species in the Chihuahua Desert [of south west America and Mexico] are expected to be replaced by other species by 2055,\" says the report.

New research, published this month in  Science Advances , discovered that as the planet heats up, the troposphere \u2013 the layer of atmosphere closest to Earth where we live \u2013 has been rising by around 164 feet (50 metres) per decade.  The troposphere stretches up for about five to nine miles (8-14km) and varies in different parts of the globe. It\u2019s thickest around the equator and has its thinnest points at the poles.  Above the troposphere, sits the stratosphere, a more stable layer which stretches to a height of 31 miles (50km) and encompasses the ozone layer. The changes may have real-world consequences when it comes to the aviation industry. Airline pilots typically fly in the lower stratosphere to avoid the turbulence dreaded by many passengers.  Warming temperatures near Earth\u2019s surface are slowly pushing up the tropopause, which is the boundary between the two lowest layers of the atmosphere Turbulence is caused by eddies of \u201crough air\u201d and is often compared to choppy waves at sea. There are several reasons for turbulence: shear (when pockets of air move passed each other in different directions); mechanical (a mountain or large structure disrupts air flow), or thermal (when warm air rises through cooler air).  Therefore, as the troposphere\u2019s upper boundary \u2013 called the tropopause \u2013 rises, it may mean that pilots have to fly higher to avoid bumpy, rough air.  While earlier studies have shown that the tropopause is rising, it was not only linked to climate change but stratospheric cooling associated with the thinning of Earth\u2019s ozone layer.  Several international agreements put in place to phase-out use of ozone-depleting chemicals have been successful in reversing this, and stabilising temperatures in the lower stratosphere. The new study looked at the latest data to understand why the tropopause is still rising regardless.  The international team of researchers, led by Nanjing University in China, deployed weather balloons to take upper air observations over the past 40 years in the Northern Hemisphere. The expansion of tropopause height, according to the study, is \u201cfurther observational evidence for anthropogenic [or man-made] climate change\u201d. Bill Randel, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and study co-author, called it an \u201cunambiguous sign\u201d of changing atmospheric structure.  \u201cThese results provide independent confirmation, in addition to all the other evidence of climate change, that greenhouse gases are altering our atmosphere,\u201d he said.

It quantifies six types of impacts, including those to health from changes in  air quality  and extreme temperature, disruptions to weather-exposed workers, and flooding threats to property. One key finding is that Black and African American individuals are projected to face higher impacts of climate change for all six impacts, compared to all other demographic groups. For example, with 2\u00b0C of global warming, Black and African American individuals are 34% more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood  asthma diagnoses  and 40% more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected increases in extreme temperature-related deaths. The report also found Hispanics and Latinos have high participation in weather-exposed industries, such as construction and agriculture, which are especially vulnerable to the effects of extreme temperatures. With 2\u00b0C of global warming, Hispanic and Latino individuals are 43% more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected reductions in labour hours due to extreme temperatures and 50% more likely to currently live in areas with the highest estimated increases in traffic delays caused by increases in coastal flooding.

They\u2019re talking about despair, impotence and powerlessness. \u201cPsychologically, when you get one piece of information that is difficult, you can ignore it. We have lives with other pressing concerns, you\u2019re worried about paying the rent or your exams or something else, and we push out concerns about the environment. That\u2019s a normal, healthy human psychological response,\u201d she says. However, in the past year \u2013 specifically since the IPCC report \u2013 that information can no longer be dismissed. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re being hit over and over again or like having eight alarm clocks in your bedroom. How is a human being meant to process this information?\u201d  Almost 70 per cent of British people want urgent political action, but there is a growing gap between announcements on climate change and the implementation of policies. The UK has promised to cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050, yet we are currently set to miss targets for both 2025 and 2030. Academics who have been at the coal face of climate research for decades are exhausted. Professor Camille Parmesan, from the School of Biological and Marine Sciences at the University of Plymouth, spent years producing scientific papers on the impacts of climate change but saw little to no action being taken by governments. She became \u201cprofessionally depressed\u201d and considered abandoning her climate research entirely. This is despite her being one of the most influential scientists of our time and a named official contributor to IPCC receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with Al Gore. \u201cSaying you\u2019re going to do something is only a small way towards actually doing something,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d say it causes me more anger than anxiety. I don\u2019t like lying, and many politicians \u2013 Trump is the champ on this \u2013 are simply lying about what the facts are. That really makes me angry. I\u2019m doing all I can to counter that, but the public still wants to believe what they are told by their leaders\u2026 strange to now begin to think of that as a bad thing.\u201d  Very few countries are currently doing much to stop climate breakdown. Even if nations were to fully implement their Paris Agreement pledges, temperatures would probably still rise by 3C by the end of the century. The future looks bleak from any angle. \u201cEco-anxiety is only going to increase. I don\u2019t see how it can\u2019t,\u201d says Ms Hickman.  \u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve got this level of anxiety with relatively little impact in terms of climate emergency in Wiltshire or in London. I look out of the window and the world looks like it does five years ago. What\u2019s it going to be look like when I look out of my window and the world looks completely different?\u201d However, Ms Hickman say eco-anxiety is a healthy and appropriate emotional response to the information we\u2019re getting. \u201cPeople need to not feel ok about this because that feeling will spur action. It\u2019s a collective anxiety. People need to process these feelings so they can continue to live their lives but not in denial. Ms Hickman says taking control of individual emissions can dramatically improve people\u2019s mental state. Rather than ignoring the issue, getting informed and involved \u2013 with things like climate caf\u00e9s, school strikes or parent groups \u2013 lessens feelings of hopelessness and loss of control. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say go hug a tree because that would be a crude version of this, but by protecting the environment, grieving what we\u2019ve done to the planet and recognising our interdependence, we will save ourselves.\u201d Dr Nick Hartley a clinical psychologist working in Newcastle Upon Tyne joined the Green Party in 2015 after feeling anxiety about the climate crisis. He wanted to understand how to address climate injustice and promote discussion of these issues at councils and parliament. He also found it helped him eat, shop and travel in more ethical ways.  \u201cIt\u2019s really important we don\u2019t downplay the challenge in making these choices, as we live in a system that makes hypocrites of us all. Facing the climate emergency is not on the shoulders of any one individual, and if we are to live with the anxiety of the gigantic task we face, then we all need to band together to push for political and systemic change,\u201d he says.

The only time this minimum has been beaten was in 2012 when the pack ice was reduced to 3.41 million sq km. Comparing last week\u2019s findings to eight years ago, the National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the minimum extent this year has more ice in the Beaufort Sea, but somewhat less ice in the Laptev and East Greenland Sea regions.\u00a0 But it is only a tongue of sea ice drifting out into the Canadian Beaufort Sea that is keeping us from setting another record minimum, Dr Jack Landy, lecturer and research Fellow at University of Bristol, said. As autumn fast approaches, bringing with it colder weather, sea ice will now begin its seasonal increase through until winter. The annual maximum for  Antarctic  sea ice typically occurs in late September or early October. While it\u2019s completely routine for Arctic floes to expand through the winter each year and then melt back again in the summer, the September lull is becoming more alarming every year as the polar north continues to be warmed by climate change. Dr Twila Moon, research scientist at University of Colorado at Boulder, said it\u2019s \u201cdevastating to see yet another Arctic summer end with so little sea ice\u201d.\u00a0 She said: \"Not only is there a very small area of sea ice, but it also younger and more vulnerable overall. The Arctic is a changed place. All hope rests on humans to act on climate and slow this alarming pace of ice loss.\u201d \u201cScience has sadly shown that we now live in a changed world, and very low sea ice areas are one indicator. The low sea ice area affects animals that people use for food and the climate that we feel even in countries far from the Arctic. Any hope of slowing the loss of sea ice rests in people and nations all over the world taking action to counter  climate change .\u201d The drop in floes, evidenced since satellites started routinely monitoring sea ice, is about 13 per cent per decade, averaged across the month. Computer models project the summer sea ice will regularly be below 1 million sq km later this century. According to Ed Blockley, Met Office scientific manager for Polar Climate, this is yet more bad news for the climate and planet Earth.\u00a0 Mr Blockley said: \u201cSeptember 2020 is now the second time in the modern record that the extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped below 4 million sq km. This threshold has been crossed because this summer has seen several periods of very rapid sea ice loss linked, in part, to the record-breaking heatwave in Siberia.\u00a0 \u201cThe Arctic is one of the most vulnerable regions on Earth to climate change and warming here will have consequences both for the region and the planet as a whole.\u201d Without extensive sea ice, the Arctic as well as the rest of the planet cannot be cooled properly. And if this downward trend continues, which scientists predict it will, more sunlight will be absorbed by the darker surface waters of the ocean, which will promote further warming and further loss of ice. Dr Moon finished by saying: \u201cArctic sea ice minimum is not a record we want to break, and it's heartbreaking to see us come so close again this year. The antidote is strong policy and action by citizens across the globe to reduce emissions of polluting gases. \"Not only will this help to protect Arctic sea ice and the animals and people who depend on it, but also reduce future risks from all climate hazards \u2013 from flooding to drought, wildfires, and health and economic impacts of sea level rise.

The survey of 1,200 adults in the UK by Censuswide found men (17 per cent) were significantly more likely than women (11 per cent) to deny the widespread evidence of global warming \u2013 from melting sea ice and glaciers and rising sea levels to animals and plants heading for the poles. However, a substantial majority of 70 per cent said they did agree the temperature is rising and that greenhouse gas emissions are to blame \u2013 as accepted by every major scientific organisation in the world. People over 55 were more likely to dispute the evidence than those in younger age groups with 15 per cent falling into this group, the poll found. The East Midlands appeared to have the highest rate of denial with 18 per cent of respondents in that region saying they did not believe in global warming \u201cat all\u201d, followed by 16 per cent in the South West and 15 per cent in the North East. The lowest rates were in the South East (8 per cent), East and North West (both 11 per cent), and Scotland and the West Midlands (both 12 per cent).

However, with its  green new deal  and promotion of a sustainable circular economy, Italy is proving to be an unlikely leader on climate issues. With devastating floods occurring across northern England, political parties in Britain would do well to learn from their counterparts in Italy.  The current coalition, composed of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and centre-left Democratic Party (PD), and headed by prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has made a raft of climate-conscious announcements. M5S has always placed a strong emphasis on protecting the environment, the party included it as a central campaign promise in the March 2018 election that swept it into power. In October, the government braved the wrath of Italy\u2019s \u201cPackaging Valley\u201d to announce a new tax on plastic in its 2020 draft budget, obliging firms to pay a \u20ac1 levy per kilogram of plastic produced. This comes in the wake of an alarming report (October 2019) by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Ispra) on the Mediterranean, entitled \u201cOn rubbish, we have hit rock bottom, and it\u2019s 75 per cent plastic\u201d. Findings revealed that more than 500,000 tons of plastic waste end up in the Mediterranean each year, with fishermen reporting more waste than fish in their nets. Walter Mittelholzer, ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich\/Dr Kieran Baxter, University of Dundee ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich Walter Mittelholzer, ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich\/Dr Kieran Baxter, University of Dundee ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich Walter Mittelholzer, ETH-Bibliothek\/Dr Kieran Baxter, University of Dundee Dr Alice Watterson, University of Dundee Dr Alice Watterson, University of Dundee Speaking on tackling plastic waste in November, Roberto Gualtieri, PD finance minister, said: \u201cwe can\u2019t first applaud the children who fight for a better environment and then not take action.\u201d Unlike our own, the Italian government recognises the importance of youth activism. In September, Lorenzo Fioramonti, M5S education minister, came out in favour of the school climate strikes, telling schools to \u201cconsider the absence of pupils taking part in the mobilisation against the climate emergency as \u2018justified\u2019\u201d. Fioramonti\u2019s endorsement of the Fridays for Future strikes marks a stark contrast to  Boris Johnson\u2019s  dismissal of Extinction Rebellion protestors in London as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d. In November, Fioramonti went a step further and introduced compulsory climate change lessons for all schools, making Italy the  first country to do so . From September 2020, children will have 33 hours a year of climate and sustainable development education. While climate change is taught in geography and science in UK secondary schools, petitions to make it a core part of the national curriculum haven\u2019t received enough signatures to be debated in parliament. Speaking on the climate emergency at the UN General Assembly in September, Conte said: \u201cItaly intends to play a leading role in the global fight against climate change. We owe it to all the young people who are making their voices heard.\u201d Johnson, in contrast, saw his own plans dismissed by Greenpeace as \u201ca flop\u201d and a failure in world leadership on the climate crisis.  Of course, it is not all plain-sailing for Italy\u2019s climate-conscious: in October, an effigy of  Greta Thunberg  was found  hanging off a motorway bridge  in Rome. Italy also continues to bear the disastrous effects of the climate crisis, with olive oil production falling by 57 per cent this year and producers faced with Italy\u2019s worst ever honey harvest. The chaotic scenes from Venice\u2019s worst tidal flooding since 1872, when official tide statistics first began, and the collapsing Planpincieux glacier on Mont Blanc are reminders that more urgent action is still needed.  However, the Italian government is heeding its young population\u2019s demands for action on the climate crisis and responding with bold policies, which is more than we can say for Britain. The climate crisis is wreaking havoc on our own shores too, but where is the political leadership on the climate crisis from our own mainstream parties?  The recent  floods  should be a rallying call to our politicians to take action as the Italians have. While we should celebrate all efforts to tackle the climate crisis, whatever the outcome of the general election, our government must do more.  In their election manifestos and in government climate policy, Britain\u2019s political leaders should take a leaf out of Italy\u2019s book, and heed M5S leader Luigi Di Maio\u2019s challenge to us all: \u201cpoliticians look to the next election; statesmen look to future generations.\u201d What is Britain waiting for?

According to official figures, the developed world gave or helped raise about $41bn (about \u00a333bn) a year in 2013 and 2014 to pay for renewable energy schemes, flood defences and other such projects. In a recent report, wealthy countries claimed to be on track to increase this amount to $100bn a year by 2020 if some \u201cmodest assumptions\u201d were allowed. The pledge to contribute that sum was reaffirmed in the Paris climate agreement, which will become an international treaty on Friday ahead of the next major summit on the issue, which begins next week in Morocco. However an analysis of the figures by Oxfam found that \u201cfuzzy maths\u201d and other dubious accounting techniques had been used to inflate the actual value of the aid. Instead of $41bn, the net assistance to developing countries was estimated at between $11bn and $21bn.  Most of the money is being spent on measures designed to reduce the rising global temperatures, rather than projects to help the poorest countries cope with its effects \u2013 like developing new ways of farming to produce enough food for people to eat. Oxfam estimated as little as $4bn may have been spent on \u2018adaptation\u2019. And while wealthy Governments say they will provide $67bn of public money a year by 2020 \u2013 with the rest of the $100bn supposedly coming from private sources \u2013 Oxfam projected the real figure could be as low as $18bn. The world\u2019s poorest countries tend to be in regions of the world where climate change will hit hardest and also have done the least to create the problem, caused mainly because of fossil fuel emissions from industrialised areas. Oxfam pointed to the current food crisis in Africa where tens of millions of people are struggling to get enough to eat amid a drought exacerbated by climate change and this year\u2019s El Nino weather system, saying this was a sign of things to come if more was not done. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's climate policy lead who co-authored the report said: \u201cClimate change is already affecting people \u2013 killing crops, flooding homes and destroying lives.  \u201cThe world\u2019s poorest people who are the most vulnerable to climate change are the least responsible, yet only a fraction of the money available is going to help them adapt. \u201cClimate finance is a lifeline for vulnerable people that are on the frontline of coping with climate change.  \u201cThe greater the share of the $100bn that is miscounted or over-counted, the less they receive to deal with floods, droughts and other extreme weather.\u201d Reuters Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Reuters Reuters Reuters ALAIN JOCARD\/AFP\/Getty Images Reuters There are two main problems in counting how much climate aid is being given. The first is the practice of counting loans as if they were grants, while another common tactic is to count the entire budget of an aid project if it includes an element of climate finance. For example, if a school is being built with flood defences, the full cost of the scheme is counted as climate finance. The report, called Climate Finance Shadow: Lifting the lid of progress towards the $100bn commitment, said: \u201cLevels of climate finance to adaptation and to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are seriously low \u2013 new commitments to increase both are urgently needed.  \u201cLDCs are being left with far too little support and adaptation continues to be seriously neglected, when in reality both should be first-order priorities for allocation of the $100bn.\u201d EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA It was scathing about the accounting system used by the wealthiest countries when assessing their own contributions. \u201cAgreement on common accounting standards is long overdue and vital to ensure that climate finance is spent effectively and efficiently to help deliver low carbon and climate resilient development,\u201d the report said. \u201cClimate finance reporting systems lack transparency, consistency and detail, resulting in wide differences and \u2018fuzzy maths\u2018 in the way developed countries report. \u201cReported levels of global climate finance overstate the actual support provided to developing countries by a large margin. This is due to, for example, many countries counting loans at face value rather than at their grant equivalent.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Then it became less predictable. But instrument data alone can\u2019t tell the jet stream\u2019s movements for comparison over the centuries, given that scientists began keeping records of weather events via instruments only in the late 19th century. The rings of  trees , however, offer a far more complete historical picture of climate variations. As they age, trees grow outward from the centre and each year a new, distinct circle of dead wood is created around the trunk of most trees. In that ring, one can find information about precipitation, temperature and other data about that year. A team led by Valerie Trouet, a dendrochronologist, has sampled 400 trees from the Balkans and 200 in Scotland \u2013 including what might be the oldest known tree in Europe, a Bosnian pine in Greece named Adonis, which is 1,075 years old. The jet stream flows between these two regions, and trees revealed the range of temperatures in their rings and the frequency of fires over time, an expansive chronicling of jet stream behaviour. \u201cMore extreme positions create more extreme climate events, especially heat waves and storms [in Europe],\u201d Trouet says. And the tree rings show \u201cbig fires happen in the Balkans when the jet is in its southerly position\u201d. Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Getty Images Getty Getty The fact that the stream has become more variable only in recent decades suggests that the shift is the result of humans\u2019 effects on climate, Trouet says. \u201cThe recent rise in variance is unprecedented in 300 years,\u201d she says. More analysis is underway to look back to even earlier centuries. Reading the climate stories these trees tell will help with forecasting. \u201cOne of the big questions in the field is what\u2019s going to happen to the jet stream,\u201d Trouet says. \u201cThis data helps the modelling of  climate change  become more reliable.\u201d Trees, it seems, are giant organic recording devices that contain information about past climate, civilisations, ecosystems and even galactic events, much of it many thousands of years old. In recent years, the techniques for extracting information from tree rings has been honed and expanded. New technologies and techniques are able to pry a much deeper and wider range of information out of trees. The field \u201chas exploded\u201d, says Edward Cook, director of the tree ring lab at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona in Tucson was founded in the 1930s by AE Douglass, an astronomer who turned to trees to better understand the connection between sunspots and climate. The lab has helped establish other labs around the world, which in turn has rapidly increased the number of studied trees. There are now roughly a dozen large labs globally and data from 4,000 sites on all continents except Antarctica. The information is stored in the International Tree Ring Data Bank, a library open to all researchers. As more tree data becomes available, a much richer picture forms of the nexus of past climate, ecosystems and human civilisation. For its first 80 years, the lab was located in much smaller \u2013 and noisier \u2013 quarters under the University of Arizona football stadium. \u201cIf you worked on Saturdays, you could hear people in the bleachers stamping their feet,\u201d says Russ Monson, who studies plant physiology in Tucson. In 2012, the lab moved into a larger building to accommodate its growing mission and number of researchers \u2013 now some 70 or so \u2013 and to unpack its vast collection of tree rings and core samples. There are now more than a half-million samples, from slivers to an enormous slice of giant sequoia in the lobby, a large enough table top, perhaps, to seat all of King Arthur\u2019s knights. The building houses the world\u2019s largest collection of tree ring samples. The basement storage area resembles a coffee-table wood shop, infused with the fragrant perfume of cut wood. Hundreds of 2-inch-thick slices of large trees, their rich grains sanded and polished, are stacked on their sides. The lab also houses a slice of the bristlecone pine that was cut down in the 1960s by a graduate student named Donald Rusk Currey from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It wasn\u2019t until after he felled the tree and counted the rings that he realised, to his horror, that he had, with permission from the US Forest Service, unceremoniously chopped down the oldest known tree in the world \u2013 a stately gnarled pine called Prometheus. Research involving tree rings is divided into three main categories \u2013 dendroclimatology, the analysis of tree rings for past climate data; dendroarchaeology, the study of tree rings to understand how past climate affected human societies; and dendroecology, which reconstructs past forest ecosystems. At this particular time, the most essential role for tree rings is probably their use in reconstructing past climate and providing much greater context. \u201cThe instrumental period provides a snapshot\u201d of past climate, says David Meko, a researcher at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, \u201cbut the tree rings are a panorama.\u201d This window into the deep climate past has become vital in a rapidly warming world, to show how the climate of the last half-century is far outside the historical norms going back thousands of years. It\u2019s hard to argue with tree rings that huge environmental changes are not occurring Living bristlecone pine trees, for example, are several thousand years old and their information is added to by those that died thousands of years ago but remained intact in their cold, dry high-altitude  environment . It\u2019s hard to argue with tree rings that huge environmental changes are not occurring. Climate change seen in the past six or seven decades has few, if any, comparisons in the far past, researchers say. The current two-decade-long  drought  on the Colorado River, for instance, is the longest since medieval times when a drought lasted for 62 years \u2013 with no very wet years in between dry years. An occasional very wet year can make a long drought more bearable. Moreover, conditions in some recent years are the hottest and driest in many centuries. \u201cWe keep breaking records year after year,\u201d Meko says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little worrisome to see the most extreme years right near the present.\u201d Unprecedented hot droughts, like the current one, make a decline in precipitation even worse by causing more evaporation. Officials along the Colorado River are deeply worried about the trend towards warmer temperatures and less precipitation and are preparing for a grim future without or with less river water \u2013 unthinkable just 20 years ago. (This year, though, was an El Ni\u00f1o year, and the snowpack in the Colorado Rockies was well above average.) To make matters worse, tree rings show that water in the Colorado River was apportioned to states based on flow from 1905 to 1922, some of the wettest years in the last 12 centuries, an era known as a pluvial period. Researchers can also look at snowpack in tree ring records. In 2015, in the Sierras the snowpack was the lowest in 500 years. This year may be one of the highest snowpacks in decades, a testament perhaps to climate whiplash. Researchers here are reconstructing snowpack data by examining tree ring records across the entire western United States for the last 2,000 years. Trees hold other valuable information as well. Oxygen isotope analysis, for example, has unlocked the source of the water that a tree took up centuries ago and can determine whether it was from a hurricane or a severe thunderstorm. Tree rings also provide a glimpse into the possible global effects of geoengineering \u2013 a proposal to scatter aluminium sulfate into the atmosphere to block the sun and cool the planet, which some scientists have proposed as a solution to climate change. \u201cVolcanic eruptions are the best proxy of geoengineering,\u201d Trouet says. Rings analysed from trees in five locations around the world show that after a volcano erupted in 1568, the global climate cooled considerably for two years \u2013 evidenced in narrow tree rings \u2013 and the northern edge of the tropics receded as the planet cooled. Those tree rings also showed that during six decades, from 1568 until 1634, there was, because of natural climate variation, six decades of expansion of the subtropics, which pushed desert climates north. Because of expanding zones of hot and dry weather, the Ottoman Empire in Turkey went into decline, the Ming dynasty collapsed and the Jamestown colony was abandoned, suggesting, Trouet says, they were, in part at least, climate-related. \u201cThe way society handles a drought politically is also part of the picture,\u201d she explains. Other sources \u2013 lake sediments; ice core samples; coral; the otolith, or ear bone, of fish; and even the shells from living and long dead geoducks, a large bivalve with a snakelike appendage \u2013 add to the broader picture. \u201cWe have divers sucking up ancient geoducks off the ocean floor,\u201d says Bryan Black, a professor of  dendrochronology  who also specialises in marine organisms. Combined with long-dead geoduck shells, data could go back many thousands of years. Shells from the coast of Iceland already go back 1,000 years. \u201cThey show that the last century is unprecedentedly warm,\u201d Black says. Experts are using the shell ring information, combined with tree ring data, to understand how climate drives ocean productivity and the species mix of fish, to assist fisheries managers. \u201cThe bottom line is to be aware of climate whiplash and what that means for fisheries,\u201d Black says. Even the stars give up some of their secrets to trees. The sun and other stars emit radiation called Galactic Cosmic Rays, or GCRs, that react in the atmosphere with nitrogen and change the levels of carbon-14, which is taken up by every living thing and becomes a tracer for cosmic ray levels. Past spikes in GCRs from solar flares or other sources are largely a mystery but have attracted keen interest from researchers, because if they occur now they could wipe out communication satellites and other technology. An event in AD 744, first found in Japanese cedar trees and since found globally, is the strongest cosmic ray event in the tree ring record, a magnitude larger than the Carrington event, a solar storm in 1859, and apparently noted by people alive at the time. \u201cThis year also appeared in the heavens a red crucifix, after sunset,\u201d was how the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles reported the event in the mid-eighth century. It was most likely a huge solar flare. \u201cIt is unprecedented, there\u2019s nothing else like it,\u201d says Charlotte Pearson, a professor at the tree ring lab. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work out what it is and what caused it but we\u2019re still not sure.\u201d \u00a9 New York Times Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Britain has agreed to cut emissions by 57 per cent by 2032 but is currently nowhere near meeting that goal. The  latest expert report  predicted the target would be missed by 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 the equivalent of all the greenhouse gases currently produced by industry. The Government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Plan was supposed to have been ready at the end of last year but the publication date was first put off until February and then again to the end of March. The Independent  can now reveal the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which is responsible for climate change after Theresa May abolished the dedicated department, is no longer standing by this latest deadline. Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the Government has a legal duty to come up with ways to meet its carbon reduction targets. Environmental legal activists at ClientEarth had already put Theresa May on notice that it was considering legal action over the Government\u2019s lack of progress on the issue,  telling the  Financial Times  it had been breaking the law for several years. And climate lawyer Jonathan Church said if the March deadline was missed this could prompt them to go to court. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear that under our analysis, the UK Government is already in breach of the Climate Change Act because its plans don\u2019t deliver the emissions reductions the Act demands,\u201d he told  The Independent . \u201cIf that remains the case come April, after many months of delay, that may be the moment to bring a legal challenge.\u201d ClientEarth has already successfully sued the Government for  failing to come up with a plan to cut air pollution  to within legally allowed standards. Barry Gardiner, shadow climate change minister, said he believed the Government was now breaking the law. The 2008 Climate Change Act \u201cdemands\u201d that the Government must produce an Emissions Reduction Plan \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cThey are clearly in breach of the statute.\u201d He criticised climate change minister Nick Hurd, who had assured him that the March deadline would be met. Mr Gardiner confronted Mr Hurd about a potential delay to the plan in the House of Commons on 23 January when the Government\u2019s Industrial Strategy report was published. It said the emissions plan would be published \u201cin 2017\u201d, rather than \u201cearly 2017\u201d as previously stated. But Mr Gardiner said Mr Hurd had told him: \u201cNo, no Barry, it\u2019s still our intention to publish by the end of March. That\u2019s just loose wording on the part of the officials.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018Can I quote you on that?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Oh yes,\u2019\u201d Mr Gardiner said. \u201cWhat it means is neither the officials nor the minister know when this is going to come out or how they are going to meet the targets.\u201d He said he believed Mr Hurd, known to be a strong supporter of action to address climate change, would \u201clike to have it out as soon as possible, but his officials simply cannot get it together\u201d. \u201cIn order to do this properly, you need cooperation between Transport, Communities and Local Government, the Cabinet Office, Defra as well as BEIS\u2026 at least five departments,\u201d Mr Gardiner said. \u201cBecause the key areas we are failing on are not actually energy, power production and renewables. It\u2019s actually energy efficiency and the transport sector. Housing and transport are key elements of this strategy. \u201cMy view is nobody in those departments is prepared to play ball with them. Nick Hurd is the minister in charge of the brief. He should be damn well making sure that it happens \u2013 it\u2019s his job to drive it.\u201d He said he did not want to call for Mr Hurd\u2019s resignation \u201cat this stage\u201d because the Government had not actually said it would miss the March deadline. And he added if Mr Hurd did quit it \u201cwould probably mean you ended up with somebody worse who didn\u2019t even want to reach the March deadline\u201d. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan The ongoing delay is potentially serious because it means industry and investors will have less time to plan for the changes that would be required, increasing the cost of making them. Environmentalists and the car industry, a key source of carbon emissions, found themselves united in calling for the Government to get a move on. Tamzen Isacsson, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Plan promises to build on its commitment to accelerating take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles, so we welcome its publication as soon as possible. \u201cPlug-in electric, hybrid and hydrogen cars will deliver even greater improvements in emissions, but this market is still small \u2013 meaningful growth will require continued support through infrastructure development, incentives and a tax regime that will stimulate consumer demand.\u201d And Gareth Redmond-King, of conservation charity WWF-UK, said: \u201cWe need a plan that gives certainty to the renewables industry, to house-builders, to electric car manufacturers \u2013 to all the companies that will invest in the technologies and infrastructure that will not only tackle climate change, but will bring jobs and growth the UK as a result. \u201cThe longer the Government leaves to publish that plan, the harder it becomes to cut emissions in time; any slippage beyond expected publication in March should give us serious cause for concern.\u201d When  The Independent  asked a BEIS spokesperson to confirm the March deadline would still be met, she refused to answer and insisted a question be emailed so it could receive a formal response. Asked if the Emissions Reduction Plan was still on course to be published by the end of March, BEIS said: \u201cOur emissions reduction plan will set out how we will reduce emissions through the 2020s and send an important signal to the markets, businesses and investors. \u201cWe are investing the time now to undertake critical preparatory work to ensure we get this right. This includes engaging across businesses, industry and other stakeholders on the shared challenge of moving to a low-carbon economy.\u201d It is understood the Government is working to get the report published \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. But Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and Environment, echoed remarks made by Mr Hurd at a BEIS committee hearing earlier this month that it was important to get the plan right, rather than rushing publication. And he said one \u201cmajor factor\u201d was likely to be the amount of time civil servants are having to devote to the prospect of leaving the European Union. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come out in March, it will be unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most important of all, it\u2019s got to be credible. \u201cI suspect the delay is a combination of: it\u2019s going to be a challenge to come up with the right policies and there\u2019s a drag effect from having to worry about Brexit.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Environmental changes in the far north are having disastrous effects on the region's indigenous people and tourism industry\u00a0 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Lapland occupies a happy space in the popular imagination as a winter wonderland, occupied by reindeer, elves and  Father Christmas . The real life  Lapland , however, is increasingly facing up to the grim reality of global warming. Besides being the name of Swedish and Finnish provinces, Lapland is the English name for a region largely above the Arctic Circle that stretches across the north of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Research has revealed the disproportionate impact of climate change in the Arctic, where temperatures are currently rising at  double the rate of the global average . The far north is bearing the brunt of global warming, and, as much of Lapland\u2019s population relies on its polar climate for their livelihoods, the effects are starting to be felt. Rovaniemi, the administrative capital of the  Finnish  province of Lapland, has done a good job of capitalising on the region\u2019s  Christmas-themed reputation . It is the self-proclaimed \u201cOfficial Hometown of Santa Claus\u201d, where the man himself can be visited 365 days a year. However, with his official residence there only constructed in 1950, Santa Claus is a relative newcomer to Lapland. The wider region is the ancient home of the  indigenous  Sami people, who refer to it as Sapmi. Owing to its remote location and freezing temperatures, much of Lapland remains relatively pristine wilderness, and it is this wilderness that provides the Sami with space to practise their ancient tradition of reindeer herding. As temperatures rise and begin to disrupt the unspoiled environment, the future prosperity of all Lapland\u2019s inhabitants \u2013 from the Sami to Santa Claus \u2013 is at risk. Shelter Shelter Shelter Shelter Shelter Shelter Shelter Shelter Dr Stephanie Lefrere first came to Finnish Lapland 18 years ago to study reindeer behaviour. Since then, she has observed dramatic changes in the region\u2019s weather patterns, and subsequent effects on its wildlife. \u201cIn my very first fieldwork, 300km (186 miles) above the Arctic Circle, it was 20\u00b0C below zero on 31 October \u2013 really the Arctic feeling by the end of October,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that any more. \u201cRecently there have been \u2018black Christmases\u2019 with no snow at all in the southern part of Finland.\" Decades of work in the region have cemented her view that climate change is having far-reaching effects on Lapland\u2019s environment, affecting animal migratory routes, habitats and behaviour. \u201cI became worried as a scientist, and also as an individual who is fascinated by the Arctic,\u201d said Dr Lefrere. She emphasised that climate change is more about trends over long periods than personal observations. However, her experiences are mirrored by figures from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, which states Finland\u2019s annual mean temperature has risen by over 2\u00b0C since the mid-19th century. \u201cIt was my childhood dream to come to Lapland, and to me it has been devastating to see changes occurring so rapidly,\u201d said Dr Lefrere. These changes are particularly devastating for the people who understand the region better than anyone: the Sami.  \u201cThe entire Sami culture circulates around nature and the reindeer,\u201d said Jannie Staffansson, an environmental chemist and indigenous rights activist at the Saami Council. \u201cWe are herders, fishers, gatherers and hunters.\u201d Sami society has always revolved around reindeer, but today Ms Staffansson estimates only 10 per cent of Sami people are still reindeer herders or owners. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult work to do, both physically and mentally, because you are so challenged keeping the reindeer safe and happy, and trying to combat climate change at the same time,\u201d says Ms Staffansson. Like Dr Lefrere, the reindeer herders have become acutely aware of the impact climate change is having on their animals.  Unpredictable weather patterns and specifically rain replacing snow during the coldest months lead to crusts of ice forming on the ground, where normally there would be a soft layer of snow.  Reindeer, which typically feed by digging into the snow and grazing on lichen, are unable to either smell food under the ice or dig to access it. \u201cYou can have herds starving to death just because they didn\u2019t dig for food,\u201d said Ms Staffansson. She emphasised the role that reindeer have in shaping everything from the Sami language to their handcrafting traditions, which rely on products like reindeer skin and antlers.  \u201cIt\u2019s an entire culture that would disappear with the reindeer,\u201d she said. The Sami are not the only people of Lapland affected by climate change. In northern Finland, tourism is a cornerstone of the regional economy, but warming temperatures are beginning to threaten its \u201cwinter wonderland\u201d image. \u201cOperators in certain areas are highly concerned,\u201d said Dr Kaarina Tervo-Kankare, a tourism geographer at the University of Oulu in central Finland. \u201cMy studies have mainly focused on the perceptions of tourism stakeholders, and their observations support the view that changes have taken place.\u201d Commonly reported changes are the late arrival of the permanent layer of snow required for winter activities, as well as the increased unpredictability of the weather. Some in the Finnish tourism industry are beginning to diversify their offering, developing their summer activities in areas that have traditionally been winter destinations. Aside from its status as a Christmas destination, the Finnish Environment Institute predicts that climate change could affect the country\u2019s attraction for fans of winter sports.  There are fears in the industry that climate changes could drive people away from places like  Rovaniemi  that have established themselves as go-to Christmas  destinations, especially as the \u201cblack Christmases\u201d described by Dr  Lefrere  begin to creep northwards. A study by Dr Tervo-Kankare and her colleagues found that Christmas tourism businesses were already feeling the heat, and that tourists did not react well to their attempts to adapt their offering. \u201cIn the light of climate change projections, maintaining the attractive image of a snow-covered winter wonderland may become impossible,\u201d they wrote. With Santa Claus Village attracting 300,000 visitors annually, Rovaniemi can ill afford to lose its tourism, but according to Dr Tervo-Kankare this is a possibility for popular Lapland tourist destinations. \u201cTourists may head further north or east, where snow security is higher,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe image may suffer to the extent where Lapland is no longer recognised as a Christmas destination.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in IPCC draft report is fourth to call for radical action to tackle environmental disaster Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The damage caused by catastrophic \u201csuperstorms\u201d combined with rising sea levels could increase by a hundred-fold or more, displacing hundreds of millions of people from coastlines around the world unless more is done to limit greenhouse gas emissions, according to a draft report by the  United Nations . According to French news agency AFP, which said it had obtained a copy of the report, the document outlines a grim scenario in which the warming  oceans  are \u201cpoised to unleash misery on a global scale\u201d, with declining fish stocks, the melting of sea ice and glaciers, and increasing levels of human displacement. Unless there are serious cuts to man-made greenhouse gas emissions, at least 30 per cent of the northern hemisphere\u2019s surface permafrost could melt within just 80 years, the report warns. This melt would unleash billions of tonnes of carbon stored in what are currently permafrost areas, which will accelerate rates of  global warming  even more. The upshot would be warming seas and rising coastlines, which could immediately threaten 280 million people, the document says.   Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images The findings come from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and is a \u201cspecial report\u201d on oceans and the Earth\u2019s frozen zones, known as the cryosphere. It is the fourth report in the last year to be published by the organisation examining the impacts of the unfolding  climate crisis , with the other three examining issues including declines in biodiversity, forest management and food, and how the effects of a 1.5C increase in average global temperatures since pre-industrialisation will be felt. All of the reports warn major change is required to avert disaster.  The warning comes as MPs and scientists have warned the UK is already on track to miss its environmental goals, including a government pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Last week a report from the Science and Technology Select Committee said efforts to reduce emissions have been undermined by \u201cunacceptable\u201d cutbacks and delays, meaning we face \u201cdire consequences\u201d. And on Thursday, the government\u2019s chief  environment  scientist said the UK cannot hit its net zero emissions goal while ministers are fixed on economic growth as measured by GDP.  Globally, many countries are also dragging their heels on putting policy in place to tackle emissions. The US \u2013 the second biggest contributor of CO2 \u2013 is exiting the Paris agreement on climate change, under Donald Trump\u2019s leadership. China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest polluter \u2013 is making strong progress in renewable technologies, but has relaxed air pollution controls and coal use is creeping upwards. In India, an enormous drive to open coal power plants is underway, though the country is also increasingly relying on solar-generated electricity. And in the EU, progress towards a mid-century net zero goal is slow due to some member states\u2019 reluctance to vote for policies legally requiring them to reduce emissions.  The Paris agreement called on all countries to work to ensure average global temperature rises remain \u201cwell below\u201d 2C warmer than the world was before the industrial revolution. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University told AFP one of the key problems was the idea humanity can overcome any problems resulting from sea-level rises. \u201cThere is a pervasive thread in the US right now, promoted by techno-optimists who think we can engineer our way out of this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the US is not ready for a metre of  sea level rise  by 2100. \u201cJust look at what happened in the wake of superstorm Sandy, Katrina, in Houston, or Puerto Rico.\u201d The IPCC\u2019s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate is due to be published on 25 September. The Independent  has contacted the IPCC for comment.

Antonio Guterres  issued the stark warning ahead of the fortnight-long UN climate change conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. Rulers and delegates from almost 200 countries will attempt to firm up the commitments made in 2015, establish new international rules for emissions trading, and broker systems of compensation for poorer countries already affected by global warming. The Alliance of Small Island States, representing nations most at risk from rising seas, views the talks as  the last chance  to avert potential \"catastrophe\", while Save the Children warns that 33 million African children are facing hunger as a result of cyclones and droughts made more likely by climate change. \u201cThe point of no return is no longer over the horizon,\u201d Mr Guterres told reporters in  Madrid . \u201cIt is in sight and hurtling towards us.\u201d Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Noting that the world has the scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, the UN chief denounced policymakers\u2019 lacklustre response in the face of a \u201cglobal climate emergency\u201d. Mr Guterres said: \u201cThe signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere, young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation. \u201cMore and more cities, financial institutions and businesses are committing to a 1.5C pathway \u2026 what is still lacking is political will. \u201cPolitical will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.\u201d He said that for the leaders of all countries to show \u201canything less\u201d than accountability and responsibility, and a willingness to commit to ambitious targets \u201cwould be a betrayal of our entire human family and all generations to come\u201d.  But he insisted his message was \u201cone of hope, not of despair. Our war against nature must stop and we know that that is possible.\u201d Some 70 countries \u2013 many of them among the most vulnerable to climate change \u2013 have pledged to stop emitting more greenhouse gases by 2050. But some of the world\u2019s largest emitters are yet to do so. Mr Guterres said he hoped the Madrid meeting would prompt governments to aim for net-zero emissions by 2050, ahead of a deadline to do so at COP26 in Glasgow next year. Last week, the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organisation warned that the level of greenhouse gases had reached another all-time high, \u201cwith no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline\u201d. Four years after the  Paris Agreement , negotiators are still to tackle the contentious issue of creating a worldwide market for emissions \u2013 a key element of the sixth article of the 2015 accord. \u201cWe are here to find answers for article six, not to find excuses,\u201d Mr Guterres said. While these talks represent the last chance for countries to keep the Paris Agreement alive by firming up their targets for 2050 after a five-year grace period, the conference also marks the first since  Mike Pompeo\u2019s announcement that  the US would turn its back on the accord, as  Donald Trump  had long threatened. The US will be represented by Marcia Bernicat, the assistant state secretary for international environmental affairs, while House speaker Nancy Pelosi will also lead a delegation of Democratic lawmakers. Organisers expect about 29,000 visitors in total, including 50 heads of state and government for Monday\u2019s opening, as well as scientists, seasoned negotiators and activists during the two-week meeting. The talks were initially to be hosted in Chile, but deadly anti-government protests in its capital, Santiago, saw the conference relocated to Spain.  Greta Thunberg  is making her way across the Atlantic in a catamaran in order to attend the talks, and is expected to land in Lisbon on Tuesday morning.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile In Grosvenor Square today, the dividing line between the crowds and the US embassy will not just be the rows of concrete blocks and security personnel. It will be between those outside demanding international action to tackle climate change, and the hugely powerful forces inside who are the biggest obstacle. There is a real possibility that within 20 years we will reach a point of no return, when the warming unlocks hitherto contained sources of greenhouse gases, such as the methane trapped under the polar ice caps. A drastic situation calls for drastic measures. That's why domestically, the Lib Dems have called for a cross-party consensus on climate change, responded to positively by the Conservative spokesman Oliver Letwin, though not yet by Margaret Beckett for the Government. There is a need to agree on annual targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to face up to the need to take radical action on a number of fronts, for example the damaging emissions from aircraft. 'US is burying head in sand' Nick Rau, Friends of the Earth Thousands of people in 32 countries across the world will take part in mass rallies to demand international action on climate change. They will call on the international community, meeting for UN climate change talks in Montreal, to take action to tackle global warming. The first week has seen progress. Growing scientific evidence has installed urgency. But the US administration is burying its head in the sand, refusing to take any meaningful action, while accepting its emissions will rise by 30 per cent by 2012. UK credibility is also hampered by its woeful domestic record. Despite promising to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent of 1990 levels by 2010, emissions have actually risen under Labour. Earlier this year Friends of the Earth launched the Big Ask campaign to get the UK Government to act at home and develop a low-carbon, nuclear-free economy. As part of this we want to see a legal obligation on the Government to cut domestic emissions by 3 per cent year on year. 'Serious political will needed' Caroline Lucas, Green Party MEP The logical conclusion that climate change is a weapon of mass destruction - and leaders who don't tackle it are guilty of crimes against humanity - is too infrequently stated. The tens of thousands expected to take to the streets will make this point. The targets most governments accept is cuts of 60 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This requires serious political will - and Tony Blair doesn't have it. CO2 emissions have risen under his premiership and he allowed business emissions to increase. He has backed a huge expansion in the UK's airport capacity and a major road-building programme. We must adopt the Contraction and Convergence principle, which holds that richer countries who have done more to create the problem should reduce emissions faster than developing nations. This allows them both to catch up and trade a surplus emissions allowance. Nationally, we must cap personal carbon emissions (domestic electricity and gas, travelling etc) - and allow surpluses to be traded.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile KILLER STORMS Warmer sea water means there is more energy to power hurricanes, and the computer-predicted increase in such \"extreme events\" with global warming seems to be coming true. Hurricane Epsilon, currently raging in the Atlantic, is the 26th named storm, and the 14th named hurricane of a record season in the US. These storms are getting more violent. An even more sobering glimpse of the future was given by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 which killed 11,000 people and left three million homeless in Honduras. RAMPANT DISEASE Although many of the effects of global warming will be felt by developing nations, rich countries will not escape. Acute heat episodes will become frequent and kill many. In the heatwave of August 2003 in western Europe - confidently attributed by scientists to climate change - 35,000 old people died, more than 18,000 in France. Heat will not be the only problem. The World Health Organisation fears that global warming, with its heavier rainfall, could lead to a major increase in insect-borne diseases in Britain and Europe such as malaria, Lyme disease and encephalitis, and has called for urgent government action to prevent it. RISING SEA LEVELS In the coming century, global sea levels are predicted to rise by up to three feet, threatening regions at or below sea level, such as Pacific islands, much of Bangladesh, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Netherlands, and even East Anglia and the Thames estuary in Britain. Storm surges - like that which drowned more than 300 people in eastern England and 1,800 people in the Netherlands in January 1953 - are likely to be much more frequent and catastrophic. The population of Bangladesh will double as its land surface halves. DEVASTATED WILDLIFE Polar bears may be the first spectacular casualties as the ice of the Arctic Ocean, on which they depend to hunt seals, is rapidly melting and will probably all be gone by mid-century. But Britain itself is already feeling the problem: we are losing to rising temperatures not only the cod in the seas around our coasts, but also the small fish such as sandeels on which seabirds depend to feed their young. Last year in the Northern Isles, Orkney and Shetland, hundreds of thousands of birds such as guillemots and arctic terns failed to breed for lack of food. WATER SHORTAGES Drought will be much more common. In the drylands, rain will be even less frequent, while some parts of the world that are temperate will become arid: central Spain may be desert-like by the mid-century. And it is not only rain that will fail. Glaciers are shrinking. Lima, with seven million people, depends for half the year on water from the Sullcon glacier in the Andes, which has retreated by 30 per cent. Himalayan glaciers which feed the river Indus, the source of much of Pakistan's water, are also shrinking. AGRICULTURAL TURMOIL The hundreds of millions of people living in the world's marginal agricultural lands, such as the countries of the Sahel region, already face a desperate daily struggle to grow food. All their energies are consumed in the effort to produce a harvest of a staple crop such as millet. As global temperatures rise, this struggle is likely to become impossible as more frequent and longer droughts make crop-growing unviable. In poor tropical regions, the increased storms predicted from climate change will be an added threat. The terrifying images of African famine are as nothing to what will come. THE 'X' FACTOR? What's predicted is terrible enough. But it is what's not even on the radar that some scientists fear most of all - the possibility that global warming might bring about some sudden, extreme and devastating climatic phenomenon that we cannot yet even imagine. The climate is a complex system, and we know that complex systems, when subject to stress, can collapse - it happens on your office desk when your computer crashes - and the global climate is now being subjected to stresses that have never been put on it before. Last year's global warming disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow tried to show this with the northern hemisphere freezing solid in a matter of weeks. Most people dismissed it as far-fetched, but something just as catastrophic may be out there, not far in the future.

An annual assessment of the Earth\u2019s climate by the  World Meteorological Organisation  (WMO) has painted a bleak picture of vanishing sea ice, devastating  heatwaves  and encroaching seas ahead of two weeks of talks in  Spain  aimed at tackling  climate change . \u201cIf we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing,\u201d Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary-general, warned in a statement. \u201cHeatwaves and floods which used to be \u2018once in a century\u2019 events are becoming more regular occurrences,\u201d he added. In 2019, countries such as the  Bahamas ,  Japan  and  Mozambique  suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones, Mr Taalas said, while \u201cwildfires swept through the  Arctic  and  Australia \u201d. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty The secretary-general also warned of the threat posed to crop yields and \u201cconsiderable food security challenges for vulnerable countries\u201d from climate change. Average temperatures from both the last five years (2015-19) and the last 10 years (2010-19) are set to be the highest on record and 2019 is on course to be the second or third warmest year on record. Arctic sea ice neared record lows in September and October, with Antarctica seeing record lows several times in 2019. The WMO has warned climate change is a key driver of a recent rise in global hunger after a decade of steady declines, with more than 820 million people suffering from hunger in 2018. The report also noted that \u201cmarine heatwaves\u201d, which have a devastating effect on underwater life, have become more common. It added that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere hit a record level of 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and has continued to rise in 2019. At the start of the  COP25  climate summit on Monday, UN secretary-general  Antonio Guterres  issued a stark warning that the planet was nearer \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and called current attempts to combat climate change \u201cutterly inadequate\u201d. The past year has seen a rise in environmental activism across the world, prompting some major political parties and companies to commit to slashing emissions. However, experts still face an uphill battle to convince major emitters, such as the US, to embrace radical changes to combat the climate crisis. The COP25 conference is the first since  Mike Pompeo , the US secretary of state, announced that the US was formally withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which sought to commit countries to keeping increases in global average temperatures to below 2C.

They found that broadly speaking the companies were being secretive about their emissions data and few had set hard targets intended to deal with their pollution.  If these industries continue down their current path, the authors of the report warned that the livestock sector could be responsible for 80 per cent of the allowable greenhouse gas budget by 2050. \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. Meat and dairy production in the countries where the top 35 companies dominate must be significantly reduced,\u201d said Devlin Kuyek, a researcher at GRAIN. \u201cThese corporations are pushing for trade agreements that will increase exports and emissions, and they are undermining real climate solutions like agroecology that benefit farmers, workers and consumers.\"  When taken together, the world\u2019s top five meat and dairy corporations are already responsible for more emissions than ExxonMobil, Shell or BP. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Meat and dairy consumption is concentrated in a small number of countries, and the top livestock companies mirror this trend. China, the US, the EU, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand are collectively responsible for over 60 per cent of global meat and dairy emissions \u2013 about twice the rest of the world on a per capita basis. As part of their analysis, the authors looked at efforts being taken to reduce emissions and found that only six had set targets that included their entire supply chain, despite this portion counting for up to 90 per cent of total emissions. The report adds to a growing body of evidence for the harm meat and dairy consumption can cause to the planet.  A paper  published in the journal  Science   in June found that if everyone stopped eating meat and dairy products, global farmland use could be reduced by three quarters. This led the study\u2019s lead author to  describe a vegan diet  as \u201cthe single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth\u201d.  The authors of the new report said this analysis was evidence of the far-reaching impact of the livestock industry and the need for food systems that meet the needs of farmers, consumers and the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s time we realised over-consumption is directly linked to the subsidies we provide the industry to continue deforesting, depleting our natural resources and creating a major public health hazard through antibiotic overuse,\u201d said Shefali Sharma, director of IATP. \u201cThis report shows what a key role they play in creating climate change as well.\u201d  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

From increased flooding to more violent droughts, every week seems to bring new warnings that without urgent change we will plunge headlong into environmental catastrophe as the world warms. Some scientists are investigating radical  geoengineering  techniques to deflect some of that heat. Ideas about planting mirrors in the ocean or creating space sunshades might seem like harebrained ideas of a nutty professor, but the eccentric nature of these plans is a measure of how desperate the situation is. None of this sci-fi style technology exists (except as a prototype), and some believe the risks of intentionally modifying the climate could be worse than the effects of climate change itself. However, authors of a UN climate report in 2018 said geoengineering may need to be used as a \u201cremedial measure\u201d. The report focused on a technique, called stratospheric aerosol injection, that mimics the effects of a volcano. Researchers looking into this area are the black sheep of climate science. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images \u201cWorking in geoengineering is a bit of a miserable experience because the climate scientists with whom you share a worldview are often pathologically opposed to stuff you\u2019re thinking about,\u201d says Matthew Watson, a volcanologist and geoengineering researcher from the University of Bristol. \u201cI find it really hard to relate to people who think climate change is really serious but don\u2019t see geoengineering as a potential option. There are a lot of deep-green environmentalists who feel that way,\u201d he says. Dr Hugh Hunt, an engineer from the University of Cambridge\u2019s department of engineering, says: \u201cIt\u2019s like talking about contraception in a Catholic school. It doesn\u2019t mean you are pro casual sex.\u201d Dr Watson and Dr Hunt researched solar radiation management (SRM) as part of the government-funded Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering collaboration which finished in 2015. SRM is a broad term used to describe ways scientists could block sunlight and cool the planet. It is one of the most controversial ways of reducing the effects of climate change. One idea is to mimic a volcanic eruption by injecting millions of tons of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, which would (in theory) reflect solar radiation back into space. History is peppered with examples of volcanic winters following massive eruptions. In 1883 the explosion of Krakatoa caused four unusually cold years, and in 1915 the eruption of Mount Tambora caused a \u201cyear without a summer\u201d. More recently, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a dip in global temperatures. Ideas about how to get sulphur dioxide in the stratosphere sound like they could have been lifted out of a JG Ballard novel \u2013 these include using a fleet of spy planes, a giant hosepipe, rockets or sprayers attached to hydrogen balloons. Aircraft that fly into the stratosphere and then dump a cargo of sulphur are often touted as the best option. These specially designed planes would need to fly at twice the altitude of commercial aircraft. This could be technologically possible but it would involve thousands of planes flying up every day to deposit enough material, according to Dr Hunt. This in itself would emit vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He believes tethered balloons might be a better option. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a big hosepipe going up 20km, held up by a hydrogen balloon. The good thing about that is that you might only need 10, 20 or 100 of these balloons and they would sit there just like a hose watering a garden,\u201d says Dr Hunt. A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that, in theory, SRM is technically feasible but the problem is global field experiments have not been done so knowledge is based on theoretical climate simulations. There is no consensus on what could work, and little funding (or political will) available for people to test potential options in the real world. \u201cI suspect you will find it easier to get an objective view of Marmite than the sulphur process from one person,\u201d comments Emeritus Professor Julian Evans from UCL. By most estimations, getting sulphur into the stratosphere is not the biggest challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s not trivial but it\u2019s not beyond our capabilities. It\u2019s what happens, the impacts and the socio-political challenges of doing it, which are the real challenge,\u201d says Dr Watson. Many say we should not even consider SRM due to a worrying list of potential side-effects, including acid rain, ozone depletion and drastic changes to monsoon rain over India and China. Some just think it won\u2019t work. Professor Piers Forster from Leeds University says the rate of CO2-induced global warming is so rapid (currently 0.2C per decade) it would wipe out any benefit of injecting sulphur in the stratosphere, even if millions of tons of sulphur was injected every year. \u201cIf any billionaires out there are considering SRM please come and talk to me first and I\u2019ll give them thousands of better ways of spending their money,\u201d he says.  Another common objection to it is \u201ctermination shock\u201d, which refers to what would happen if society lost the will or means to continue. SRM masks global warming by shielding light from the sun rather than reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That means stopping it could cause sudden and catastrophic warming that could be considerably more dangerous than current levels of warming. It is a geopolitical minefield. Who would have their hand on the thermostat? Perhaps the US military? Or a big multinational corporation? Or even Boris Johnson? Dr Watson says that if we did end up using SRM it would be \u201cabsolutely the clearest indication we have failed miserably as a species\u201d. Many feel even researching SRM as a potential option provides an escape route for governments to avoid the critical job of cutting emissions. Dr Hunt says: \u201cThe public perception at the moment is that climate change is really important. But are people going to say let\u2019s pump aerosols into the atmosphere? I don\u2019t think they will because essentially it\u2019s letting fossil fuel companies off the hook. \u201cClimate scientists can\u2019t be seen to be in favour of geoengineering whereas for us engineers, our job isn\u2019t on the line. We can say things that climate scientists can\u2019t say. We might sound as if we\u2019re in favour of climate engineering but that\u2019s just not the case at all.\u201d Dr Hunt says it is imperative the technique is researched so if it does need to be used it can be done as safely as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated picture and I\u2019m not in any way pro geoengineering. I\u2019m very much pro research. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like chemotherapy. If you\u2019re going to have chemotherapy, you would like to have thought the research would have been done so it\u2019s safe.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The policy covers both online ads and creator payments and will be enforced from November. In a statement from Google Ads, the company says that it works closely with outside experts to regularly review and update policies both to satisfy the needs of brands as well as to protect users from unreliable claims such as anti-vaccine advocacy or fake cures. \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve heard directly from a growing number of our advertising and publisher partners who have expressed concerns about ads that run alongside or promote inaccurate claims about climate change,\u201d the statement says. \u201cAdvertisers simply don\u2019t want their ads to appear next to this content. And publishers and creators don\u2019t want ads promoting these claims to appear on their pages or videos.\u201d The new policy prohibits advertisers, publishers, and creators on YouTube from making any ad revenue from \u201ccontent that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change\u201d. \u201cThis includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\u201d Luis Di Como, Unilever\u2019s executive vice president of global media, says that the consumer goods giant believes that any content that seeks to deliberately mislead and misinform the public on climate change has no place on media platforms. \u201cGoogle\u2019s new policy to prohibit the monetisation of content that denies climate change is a welcome first step and we look forward to greater accountability and progress in this space.\u201d When evaluating content against the policy, Google will take context into account \u2013 for example, \u201cdifferentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim\u201d. \u201cWe will also continue to allow ads and monetisation on other climate-related topics, including public debates on climate policy, the varying impacts of climate change, new research, and more,\u201d the announcement states. Enforcement will be by a mixture of automated tools and human review. In making this policy change, Google says it has consulted authoritative sources on climate science, including experts who contributed to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s assessment reports. \u201cClimate change is the defining challenge of humanity. Misinformation plays a huge part in holding back progress, so this action from Google matters,\u201d say co-chairs of the Conscious Advertising Network, Harriet Kingaby and Jake Dubbins. \u201cCAN is proud to partner with Google on the development of this policy.\u201d The new policy comes as Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a number of consumer initiatives to improve sustainability. Google is rolling out new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints, a Nest program to support clean energy from home, and eco-friendly routing on Google Maps. Further, when people search with questions about climate change, they will be directed to authoritative information from sources such as the United Nations, in addition to the existing news sources.

The global fishing industry produces a total catch worth of about $90bn (\u00a371bn) but the warming ocean temperatures are causing many valuable species to shift their usual ranges. The potential for water to hit temperatures lethal to corals such as Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, which support vast amounts of other marine life, is a particular problem. The researchers assessed 147 countries based on their vulnerability to the effect of future warming on fishing in their waters and their ability to cope with the changes. The worst-affected countries were mostly small islands, with Kiribati, Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, the Maldives and Vanuatu making up the top five, according to  a paper in the journal  PLOS ONE . However, large countries like China, in eighth place, Nigeria (15th) and Indonesia (26th) also featured high on the list. Ireland was predicted to be the least vulnerable country in 147th place, followed by Chile, the UK, Iceland and Namibia, with the US in sixth. The five worst-affected countries were given a \u201cvulnerability score\u201d that was eight to nine times higher than those at the bottom of the list. Writing in the journal, the researchers warned that climate change\u2019s effect on fisheries could harm food security, people\u2019s livelihoods and public health \u2013 particularly in poor countries that are less able to cope. \u201cMore than 87 per cent of least developed countries are found within the top half of the vulnerability index, while the bottom half includes all but one of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states [wealthy countries],\u201d they said. \u201cThis is primarily due to the tremendous variation in countries\u2019 adaptive capacity, as no such trends are evident from the exposure or sensitivity indices.\u201d  Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray And the countries that have done the least to cause climate change appear to be the ones that can expect their fisheries to be the worst affected by it. \u201cA negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon emissions, and the clustering of states at different levels of development across the vulnerability index suggests growing barriers to meeting global commitments to reducing inequality, promoting human well-being and ensuring sustainable cities and communities,\u201d the researchers wrote.

It\u2019s a snowball, from outside here. So it\u2019s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable.\u201d Washington DC gets an average of about 12cm (5 inches) of  snow in February . Now 31 major scientific organisations in the US \u2013 including the  American Association for the Advancement of Science , the  American Meteorological Society  and the  Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  \u2013 have signed a joint letter to Congress urging them to accept that climate change is real and action needs to be taken. \u201cObservations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research concludes that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver,\u201d they write. \u201cThis conclusion is based on multiple independent lines of evidence and the vast body of peer-reviewed science. \u201cThere is strong evidence that ongoing climate change is having broad negative impacts on society, including the global economy, natural resources, and human health. \u201cFor the United States, climate change impacts include greater threats of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and increased risk of regional water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires, and the disturbance of biological systems. The severity of climate change impacts is increasing and is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades.\u201d The letter adds that to reduce the risk of the \u201cmost severe\u201d impacts of climate change, \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions must be substantially reduced\u201d. \u201cIn addition, adaptation is necessary to address unavoidable consequences for human health and safety, food security, water availability, and national security, among others,\u201d the signatories say. \u201cWe, in the scientific community, are prepared to work with you on the scientific issues important to your deliberations as you seek to address the challenges of our changing climate.\u201d EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA They can expect a frosty reception from some, particularly Mr Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and is also the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.

The organisation\u2019s first comprehensive  report  about the relationship between  climate change  and the land suggests more sustainable farming, making changes to our diet and cutting food waste will all help to tackle global warming.  Human activity has caused significant land degradation, deforestation and destruction of natural habitats, says the report from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ).  All of this has resulted in carbon dioxide being released from the soils and into the atmosphere. For centuries, natural land was an important way of absorbing carbon dioxide and keeping it in the land, but it is now responsible for a third of  greenhouse gases . Reuters Getty Reuters PA Getty PA Reuters Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP PA Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters Getty Reuters Getty AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty Getty Reuters Reuters EPA AP AFP\/Getty PA EPA EPA PA Getty  AP AFP\/Getty Reuters AP PA AP At the same time, climate change-induced wildfires, permafrost melt and desertification are putting strain on the land, which means it is releasing even more greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere.  \u201cThis is a perfect storm. Limited land, an expanding human population, and all wrapped in a suffocating blanket of climate emergency,\u201d said Professor David Reay from the University of Edinburgh, who advised the report\u2019s authors. \u201cCrop yields are already being hit hard by climate change, staples like wheat, maize and rice are all at risk. The global web that is our food system means that impacts on farms thousands of miles away ripple right back to our own dinner plates. \u201cEarth has never felt smaller, its natural ecosystems never under such direct threat.\u201d Soils now hold just 1 per cent of the planet\u2019s total carbon, but they once contained as much as 7 per cent.  To escape this vicious cycle, the UN report suggests humans need to urgently stop chopping down rainforest, degrading soils and peatlands. Sustainable farming, replanting forests and protecting habitats can also help curb global warming. \u201cBalanced diets featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, and animal-sourced food produced sustainably in low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation to and limiting climate change,\u201d said Debra Roberts, co-chair of IPCC Working Group II, which contributed to the report.  Land must remain productive to maintain food security as the population increases, the report states. The study also suggests the emphasis for farming systems should be diversification. Mixed systems of arable and livestock, or fallow and wooded land, gives greater resilience to climate change and also improves soil condition, carbon storage and biodiversity. Professor Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the study, said   Brexit  provides the UK with the chance to create a farming policy that could make the land a sink for carbon as opposed to a source. The National Farmers\u2019 Union wants to reach net zero agriculture by 2040, an ambition that IPCC authors say is achievable.  Vicki Hird from Sustain, a British charity that advocates better food and farming, said: \u201cThe IPCC report proposes adopting farming practices that work with nature rather than forcing production with overuse of artificial fertilisers. A key step would be to end harmful subsidies of big single crops, such as corn, sugar cane, soy, and fossil fuels.\u201d A good example of agroforestry is mixing banana plantations with coffee plantations as the bananas give shade to the coffee, according to Professor Reay. Growing two crops simultaneously means the farmer is less reliant on one monoculture that could be wiped out by disease or severe weather.  A spokesperson from the Pasture-Fed Livestock Association (PFLA) said: \u201cIntensively grown grains have resulted in significant soil degradation and loss on arable farms. This can be remedied by reintroducing pasture and grazing animals as part of a mixed farming system, with both pasture and dung helping to rebuild soil fertility and health.\u201d Scientists say reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors will be essential if global warming is kept to below 2C, if not 1.5C. The latest report from the IPCC comes after a study from the international body last year called for \u201cunprecedented\u201d action to slash carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and limit dangerous global warming.

One section of society, however, are conspicuous by their absence, both in terms of those involved in the direct action and in the way we\u2019re talking about the climate crisis: people of colour.   Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the environmental movement. In 2015 at a climate march in London, the Wretched of the Earth bloc \u2013 made up of indigenous, black and brown people on the frontlines of climate change \u2013  was replaced by a group of people dressed in animal headgear . They were told their anti-capitalist, anti-colonial message wasn\u2019t \u201cpositive\u201d enough, and their demand for the recognition that communities across the  global south  are \u201cthe  first to die, the first to fight\u201d from climate impacts was censored.   In the case of Extinction Rebellion, history is now repeating itself. Over the past week the group has staged creative direct actions and takeovers of key London sites \u2013 which is critical for escalating the urgency with which climate change is tackled. Central to their mission, however, is a strategy of mass arrests. \u201cArrests aren\u2019t happening quickly enough\u201d,  said Extinction Rebellion\u2019s co-founder Roger Hallam  during protests last November. During this round of actions, over 700 arrests had been made at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the group\u2019s social media accounts even go so far as to   praise the police .   Many have   rightly critiqued   this stance for alienating working class communities and people of colour, and failing the cause of anti-racism. People of colour do not simply face far higher risks when dealing with the police: black and brown people   die at their hands.   This year marks 20 years since the MacPherson inquiry, launched to investigate the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and labelled the police\u2019s response as \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d. In those 20 years,  it seems  very little has changed . Of 17 cases of deaths in police custody where force was used in 2017-18, 47 per cent of those who died were black. For Extinction Rebellion to deliberately target arrests and play up to the idea that they are \u201c quite nice people \u201d (as opposed, presumably, to the \u201cferal underclasses\u201d) is not just alienating to those on the receiving end of state violence \u2013 it is downright insulting.   Reuters Getty Reuters PA Getty PA Reuters Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP PA Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters Getty Reuters Getty AFP\/Getty PA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty Getty Reuters Reuters EPA AP AFP\/Getty PA EPA EPA PA Getty  AP AFP\/Getty Reuters AP PA AP However, Extinction Rebellion\u2019s tactics betoken a deeper problem in its stance to  race  and politics. It rightly proclaims we are in a moment of crisis, and tells us to \u201crebel for life\u201d, but says  the climate crisis is \u201c beyond politics \u201d. What the movement is missing \u2013 or at least isn\u2019t stating nearly clearly enough \u2013 is that the climate crisis is the result of neoliberal capitalism, and a global  system of extraction, dispossession and oppression. Just 100 companies are responsible for 71 per cent of all emissions \u2013 often that\u2019s fossil fuel companies extracting profit from the global south and committing human rights abuses along the way.   What\u2019s more, it is people in countries across the global south who are already on the frontlines of climate change impacts. This isn\u2019t just about \u201cour children\u201d, as Extinction Rebellion has suggested \u2013 it\u2019s about real people now, being displaced, being exploited, and dying.  The group demands the \u201ctruth\u201d, whatever that might be, and a citizens\u2019 assembly, but people across the global south   have been making demands of us for decades : that we repay our climate debt, honour our climate financing obligations to countries across the global south, stop the corporate capture of trade and climate talks, and commit to radically reducing emissions to stay well below a 1.5-degree limit of average global warming.   It\u2019s high time we listened. These demands entail a total transformation of our economy, to make it serve the common good and not the interests of the 1 per cent. This transformation can both  address racial and social injustices at home and abroad,  and create a fairer, happier, more prosperous future for us all. The demand of a  Green New Deal , taken up by campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal \u2013 of which I am a member \u2013 alongside the youth climate strikers, sees the fight against climate catastrophe as inextricably linked to the fight against capitalism and against racial and social injustices. And recognises that this fight is global.   So too are our solutions. A Green New Deal can build a more equal and more prosperous society at home, with democratic ownership of industry, utilities and more, and mass investment in transport, care sectors and left-behind communities. But it will fail if it does not have the principle of internationalism at its heart.  The reason the climate movement must go beyond Britain\u2019s borders isn\u2019t just because justice demands we support the countries our country grew rich from pillaging. The fact is that without paying our historical debts  to global south countries in the form of the finance and technology transfers, these countries won\u2019t also be able to play their part in the global  decarbonisation we need to avert climate catastrophe.   Anti-racism and internationalism need to be central to every environmental movement, whether we\u2019re working within political parties or building pressure on the streets. Labour for a Green New Deal will not just be demanding a radical Labour  government takes drastic climate action, we will be demanding racial and global justice are political priorities. It\u2019s only this way that we\u2019ll be able to win.

Data collected from satellites suggests that the quantity of ice lost between 2010 and 2018 would submerge an area the same size as the  Netherlands  under seven feet of water. Researchers say that rising temperatures in the Arctic Ocean seem to be playing a key role in accelerating ice melt from two large archipelagoes that border the Kara Sea. Warming of the  Arctic Ocean  appears to play a key role in accelerating ice loss from two large groups of islands that border the Kara Sea, researchers say. A team from the University of Edinburgh used data collected by the European Space Agency\u2019s CryoSat-2 research satellite to map and monitor changes to both the surface height and the mass of ice caps and glaciers. The team then compared their findings with climate data for the same period of eight years and found what they say is a clear link between rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures and an increase in loss of ice from the two groups of islands. Analysis  indicated that between the years of 2010 and 2018, the Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya archipelagos \u2013 which make up a combined area of about 50,000 square miles \u2013 lost a total of 11.4 billion tonnes of ice annually.  The stability of several of the region\u2019s glaciers and ice caps has already been affected by the thinning of ice, with concerns that more ice loss could be seen in the future, said the team. Ice caps are large bodies of ice which are several hundred meters thick and in the particular region, cover areas of up to around 8,000 square miles.  Glaciers, on the other hand, are relatively smaller in size. Indeed, some of the ice caps store ice which is up to 12,000 years old and can provide scientists with important long-term records of the Arctic climate. Lead author of the study, Dr Paul Tepes, of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s School of GeoSciences, said: \u201cThe Russian Arctic is largely inaccessible, but satellite data has enabled us to monitor changes to its ice caps and glaciers. \u201cAs has been observed elsewhere in the world, ice loss in the region is accelerating. \u201cAs the climate continues to warm, significant ice loss in the  Russia n Arctic will have clear impacts for sea level rise.\u201d The results of the study support a body of research which suggests that conditions in the Arctic Ocean are starting to become much warmer, more like those found in the North Atlantic. The team hopes that the study may help to predict future ice loss in regions which are experiencing similar patterns of temperature change in both the ocean and the atmosphere. It could also help to improve global sea level predictions.

Tom Crowther, who recently led a global warming report that is already being adopted by the United Nations, also said the US President\u2019s short-sighted approach was \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cinsane\u201d. The billionaire tycoon signed an executive order as part of the administration\u2019s plan to  roll back Barack Obama\u2019s climate change  measures. Dr Crowther, back in December, said average temperatures are forecast to increase by 1C by 2050 and that global warming is  beyond the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d . His report, which was celebrated by academics across the globe, said climate change scientists had not previously taken account of harmful carbon gasses emitted from the soil: known as \u2018positive feedback\u2019. \u201cCertainly Trump\u2019s policy will bump that number up and will accelerate climate change and that\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Dr Crowther, speaking to  The Independent . \u201cIt will speed up those feedbacks that my paper was talking about.\u201d Dr Crowther, a 30-year-old from north Wales who is now a Marie Curie fellow at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, said even  Barack Obama\u2019s  approach to climate change was deemed by scientists to be sub-par. The Democrat leader promised to cut CO2 emissions by 26 per cent before 2025, in keeping with the  Paris climate deal , but critics urged him to speed up. \u201cIf Obama\u2019s administration wasn\u2019t doing enough, if that was against people\u2019s constitutional rights, then this has to be seen as a drastic crime against the people of America and the world,\u201d said Dr Crowther. The former Yale University academic also said Mr Trump\u2019s policy would destroy more jobs than it creates in the long run, because global warming will terrorise industries that are tied to the land. Mr Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to reverse Mr Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d, but a  US Department of Energy report  in January claimed the renewable energy sector employed far more than the fossil fuel sector. It said 187,117 worked in coal, oil and natural gas, while more than 650,000 worked in wind, solar and biofuels. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to put the US at a massive disadvantage as the rest of the world moves forward,\u201d said Dr Crowther. \u201cIf, as a lot of studies suggest, that renewable energies employ more people than coal and other natural gases, then sticking with natural gas is reducing the potential for job creation. \u201cBut also indirectly, continued use of fossil fuels drives climate change, which causes degradation of land, and of agricultural, forestry, and fishery industries, which rely on millions of jobs. So I would say it\u2019s ridiculously short term and short sighted to progress with coal industries.\" Mr Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on Monday, initiates a review of the Clean Power Plan which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants. The 70-year-old has remained silent since his inauguration on whether the administration will withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement since his inauguration. \u201cAs Trump withdraws from all of these agreements, our once in a lifetime chances of offsetting the devastating impacts of climate change just continue to slip away,\" added Mr Crowther.

And a total of 72% of Brits think it is important that businesses prioritise climate-friendly practices over profit, according to data gathered by ethical search engine SearchScene. A similar majority, 67%, want rich countries to start diverting more of their wealth towards the same problem. The results in favour of government and business-backed climate action coincide with British dissatisfaction with climate conference COP26. Only a fifth (22%) believe COP26 was a success. The research comes as  Amazon  founder Jeff Bezos announced $443 million in donations to climate organisations. The most recent contributions are in addition to the $791 million he gave to 16 organizations last year as part of his $10 billion commitment to his Earth Fund to fight climate change. However, Amazon has been targeted by campaigners for its\u00a0alleged exploitative and environmentally destructive business practices and  disregard for workers\u2019 rights  in the name of company profits.

The people want action. \u201cThey want large corporations to get involved on a large scale in combatting the climate crisis, and also want governments to step up their game, particularly the UK government. \u201cThe figures are highly revealing; it\u2019s not a slim majority \u2013 it\u2019s a strong majority that wants to see more action.

The cable, sent by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embassies, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels. In the wake of President Donald Trump's announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the accord, the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like \"Does the United States have a climate change policy?\" and \"Is the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy?\" If asked, for example, \"What is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?\", the answer should be vague. \"We are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,\" the cable advises. A US State Department official declined to comment on the cable. Mr Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on a promise to \"cancel\" the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the US economy trillions of dollars while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In sharp contrast to the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, Mr Trump has several times called climate change a hoax. In June, Mr Trump left the door open to re-engagement with the Paris Agreement if the terms improved. The United States will \"start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair,\" he said. The State Department guidance clarifies that right now, \"there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement\". But it adds: \"The President is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for US economic growth and energy security.\" The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025. Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which  The New York Times  published on Monday. The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report's findings or editing them. The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal to protect US interests. The next summit is in November. Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray A US official said a major priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations - long a sticking point in negotiations. \"There's certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,\" the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo. The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration. \"The new principles will allow the (United States) the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,\" the cable said.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Unusually warm temperatures helped create conditions necessary for monstrous tornadoes Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile  The calendar said December but the warm moist air screamed of springtime. Add an eastbound storm front guided by a  La Nina  weather pattern into that mismatch and it spawned tornadoes that killed dozens over five US states. Tornadoes  in December are unusual, but not unheard of. But the ferocity and path length of Friday night's tornadoes likely put them in a category of their own, meteorologists say.  One of the twisters \u2014 if it is confirmed to have been just one \u2014 likely broke a nearly 100-year-old record for how long a tornado stayed on the ground in a path of destruction, experts said. \u201cOne word: remarkable; unbelievable would be another,\u201d said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \u201cIt was really a late spring type of setup in in the middle of December.\u201d Warm weather was a crucial ingredient in this tornado outbreak, but whether climate change is a factor is not quite as clear, meteorologists say. Scientists  say figuring out how climate change is affecting the frequency of tornadoes is complicated and their understanding is still evolving. But they do say the atmospheric conditions that give rise to such outbreaks are intensifying in the winter as the planet warms. And tornado alley is shifting farther east away from the Kansas- Oklahoma  area and into states where Friday's killers hit. Here's a look at what's known about Friday's tornado outbreak and the role of climate change in such weather events.  Tornadoes  are whirling, vertical air columns that form from thunderstorms and stretch to the ground. They travel with ferocious speed and lay waste to everything in their path. Thunderstorms occur when denser, drier cold air is pushed over warmer, humid air, conditions scientists call atmospheric instability. As that happens, an updraft is created when the warm air rises. When winds vary in speed or direction at different altitudes \u2014 a condition known as wind shear \u2014 the updraft will start to spin. These changes in winds produce the spin necessary for a tornado. For especially strong tornadoes, changes are needed in both the wind\u2019s speed and direction. \u201cWhen considerable variation in wind is found over the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere, tornado-producing \u2018supercell thunderstorms\u2019 are possible,\u201d said Paul Markowski, professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cThat\u2019s what we had yesterday.\u201d  There's usually a lot of wind shear in the winter because of the big difference in temperature and air pressure between the equator and the Arctic, Mr Gensini said. But usually, there's not a lot of instability in the winter that's needed for tornadoes because the air isn't as warm and humid, Mr Gensini said. This time there was. A few factors, which meteorologists will continue to study.  Spring-like temperatures across much of the Midwest and South in December helped bring the warm, moist air that helped form thunderstorms. Some of this is due to La Nina, which generally brings warmer than normal winter temperatures to the Southern US. But scientists also expect atypical, warm weather in the winter to become more common as the planet warms.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario happened. Warm air in the cold season, middle of the night,\u201d said John Gordon, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Louisville, Kentucky.  Once the storm formed, exceptionally strong wind shear appears to have prevented the tornadoes from dissipating, experts say. Tornadoes are thought to die off when thunderstorm updrafts lose energy.  Tornadoes typically lose energy in a matter of minutes, but in this case it was hours, Mr Gensini said. That\u2019s partly the reason for the exceptionally long path of Friday's storm, going more than 200 miles (322 kilometres) or so, he said. The record was 219 miles (352 kilometres) and was set by a tornado that struck four states in 1925. Mr Gensini thinks this one will surpass it once meteorologists finish analysing it. \u201cIn order to get a really long path length, you have to have a really fast moving storm. This storm was moving well over 50 miles (80 kilometres) per hour for a majority of its life,\u201d Mr Gensini said. That's not the speed of the winds, but of the overall storm movement. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about highway-speed storm motions,\u201d Mr Gensini said.  It\u2019s complicated. Scientists are still trying to sort out the many conflicting factors about whether human-caused climate change is making tornadoes more common \u2014 or even more intense. About 1,200 twisters hit the US each year \u2014 though that figure can vary \u2014 according to the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. No other country sees as many.  Attributing a specific storm like Friday's to the effects of climate change remains very challenging. Less than 10 per cent of severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, which makes drawing conclusions about climate change and the processes leading up to them tricky, said Harold Brooks, a tornado scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory.  Scientists have observed changes taking place to the basic ingredients of a thunderstorm, however, as the planet warms. Mr Gensini says in the aggregate, extreme storms are \u201cbecoming more common because we have a lot warmer air masses in the cool season that can support these types of severe weather outbreaks.\u201d  The US is likely to see more tornadoes occur in the winter, Mr Brooks said, as national temperatures rise above the long-term average. Fewer events will take place in the summer, he said.  Furtado of the University of Oklahoma said tornado alley, a term used to describe where many twisters hit the US, has shifted eastward into the Mississippi River Valley. That shift is because of increases in temperature, moisture and shear.  \u201cBottom line: The people in the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley are becoming increasingly vulnerable to more tornadic activity with time,\u201d he said.

For the moment, social isolation measures mean life is almost completely lived out online. Here,  The Independent  offers some ideas for tackling  climate change  and protecting the planet that you can do from the safety of home. CAMPAIGN Activists have cancelled physical strikes and meet-ups due to the lockdown but the climate movement hasn\u2019t gone away. Major events are being planned around the 50th anniversary of Earth Day this month where the theme is climate action. Here\u2019s some ways to get involved: 22 April: Earth Day is going digital for the first time in its history and you can join it  here . 17 April at 11am (PST): Lifelong activist, actress  Jane Fonda  continues with her  Fire Drill Fridays online . This week, she\u2019s having a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and architect of the Paris Climate Agreement. 24 April: Fridays For Future are holding a 24-hour livestream on  YouTube  featuring activists from around the world. The movement, started by Greta Thunberg in 2018, had planned a global school strike that day but altered course due to Covid-19. The Union of Concerned Scientists  has suggestions for letters to send on varying issues.  This one  relates to the coronavirus pandemic and making sure frontline workers are protected and  here , you can voice your opinion on a Trump administration proposal to restrict the use of scientific studies at the Environmental Protection Agency. CROWDSOURCE Get together (while you\u2019re staying safely apart) with an online crowdsourcing project. Volunteer for people-powered research at  Zooniverse  which has projects across a variety of areas including climate. Count and track giraffes in northern Kenya; digitise records from research vessels to inform future ecology and conservation studies; or help protect marine ecosystems by tracking Giant Kelp forests around the globe. The Scistarter website, with its motto \u201cscience we can do together\u201d has a handy  search tool  that lets you find its projects that are online only. Track weather events, help ocean scientists better understand the experiences of microscopic marine microbes or put your unused computing power to science projects are all ideas on the list. MIT\u2019s  Climate CoLab  aims to harness the collective intelligence of people around the world to create proposals to help achieve global climate change goals.  TAKE ACTION The coronavirus has sparked a boom of pet adoptions and fostering but you can virtually adopt an animal here with  International Animal Rescue . Connect with friends and family with free online greeting cards from the  World Wildlife Fund . Even though you\u2019re staying home, you can plan ahead with ideas to go \u201czero waste\u201d \u2013 a helpful list is compiled  here  on everything from reducing food waste to clothes swaps. Some of us are already socialising with friends and family, and working from home using Zoom, Skype and other video platforms but they also play an important role in a more climate-friendly lifestyle.  The Verge  has some advice on how to look better doing it and so does climate scientist  Professor Katharine Hayhoe  who has spent the past few years transitioning many of her talks into the virtual realm. (While you\u2019re at it, design your workspace around natural light, in support of  Daylight Hour  on June 19.) Do a home energy audit. A quick walk-though of your home can spot the ways energy is being lost and how to save it. There are ideas  here . Try unplugging your devices \u2013 around a quarter of residential energy use goes that way. Inactive devices translates to approximately $19 billion a year, about $165 per household in the US on average, worth of electricity, according to one  study . Laundry doesn\u2019t stop even when the world shuts down. Save those greenhouse-gas emissions from heating water by washing loads in cold water which is just as effective, according to the  New York Times . Hang-dry those clothes, too, if you can. If all Americans line-dried for even six months of the year, it would save 3.3% of the country\u2019s total residential output of carbon dioxide, experts told the  paper . And while you\u2019re raking through clothes, look at what\u2019s in your closet.  Dr Jennifer Baumgartner  says most people wear only 20% of their wardrobe, 80% of the time. Americans, on average, toss 80lb of clothing a year \u2014 so figure out what you need and fill bags for recycling for when the lockdown is over. Think about how much meat you\u2019re eating. Cattle and sheep are a major source of the greenhouse gas methane. Try out vegan (or baby steps with vegetarian) recipes. There\u2019s some ideas to get you started,  here  and  here . LEARN The  National Emergency Library , a collection of nearly 1.5 million digitised publications, has been made public. A quick search on climate brings up more than 3,000 titles. Happy reading!

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Climate experts say controversial academic is way off  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Jordan Peterson , a Canadian academic and philosopher popular among the alt-right, has come in for heavy criticism following an appearance on Tuesday on the  Joe Rogan  Experience  podcast.  On the show, Mr Peterson made basic errors speaking about global heating and declared \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as climate.\" And in responding to outrage from scores of climate scientists, he has noted that his information came in part from a climate-denier who has accepted funding from right-wing billionaires and oil interests. The fracas began on the show, the top podcast in the nation, with an estimated audience of 11 million listeners, when the Canadian psychology professor argued that the complexity of the world rendered modelling climate change impossible. \u201cAnother problem that bedevils climate modelling, too, which is that as you stretch out the models across time, the errors increase radically. And so maybe you can predict out a week or three weeks or a month or a year, but the farther out you predict, the more your model is in error,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a huge problem when you\u2019re trying to model over 100 years because the errors compound just like interest.\u201d Actual climate experts quickly condemned these statements as a \u201c word salad of nonsense ,\u201d based on a basic error conflating infinitely variable weather with straightforwardly predictable climate. Responding to the criticisms, Mr Peterson cited the book  Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming\u2019s Unfinished Debate , by S Fred Singer, on Twitter on Thursday. Singer, who died in 2020, was the founder of the Science and Environment Policy Project, a climate-sceptic advocacy group that received funding from the Heartland Institute, a think tank backed by oil interests, ExxonMobil, and the Koch family,  as Desmog reports . Singer held a number of deeply fringe views on climate society, calling human climate emissions \u201ctrivial\u201d and criticising the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, considered the world\u2019s foremost authority on climate science, which makes peer-reviewed findings based on the work of the best climate scientists around the globe. \u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has to provide proof for significant human-caused climate change; yet their climate models have never been validated and are rapidly diverging from actual observations,\u201d Singer wrote in an article in 2016. In fact, as climate scientists have noted, models have been accurately predicting the  climate crisis  for decades on end. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, we have been projecting future warming since the first climate models in the late 1960s\/early 1970s,\u201d wrote climate scientist and IPCC contributor Zeke Hausfather on Twitter this week. \u201cWe can look back to see how well they have performed. It turns out our models generally did a good job.\u201d \u201cBack in the early 1970s, scientists were building simple climate models and they hypothesised that rising greenhouse gas emissions would warm the planet,\u201d added Dr Simon Evans, policy editor at Carbon Brief, in DeSmog. \u201cWell,  the results are in , and those scientists were right. Not only that, those models \u2013 and other more recent ones \u2013 have been pretty accurate in estimating how much warming we would get.\u201d Jordan Peterson\u2019s statements are \u201cmaking the ancient climate sceptic error of mixing up weather and climate,\u201d Professor Steve Sherwood, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, told  The Guardian . \u201c[Peterson\u2019s] argument is like saying we can\u2019t predict whether a pot of water on a flame will boil, because we decide in advance what variables to put in our model, and can\u2019t predict each bubble,\u201d  he said . The Independent  has reached out to Jordan Peterson for comment. The Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify has increasingly come in for criticism on all sides, due to its frequent airing of fringe opinions on Covid and other vital topics, inspiring rock legend  Neil Young  to  boycott the platform and remove his music  until the coronavirus misinformation was removed.

Analysing data collected since 1923, a research team examined the different factors that contributed to changes in rainfall in the Sahara region. They found the desert, already around the size of the US, had expanded by about 10 per cent over the period covered by this data. These results have implications for those living in the border region of the Sahara known as the  Sahel , but the scientists noted that climate change-driven desertification is not a phenomenon unique to the Sahara. \"Our results are specific to the Sahara, but they likely have implications for the world's other deserts,\" said Professor Sumant Nigam, an atmospheric and oceanic scientist at the University of Maryland and the senior author of the study. As the world\u2019s population continues to grow, people in desert border regions cannot afford to lose more arable land to the desert.  As with any desert, the Sahara undergoes seasonal patterns of expansion and contraction, but Professor Nigam and his colleagues were able to establish the extent of its overall expansion. In order to single out the effects of climate change, the scientists used statistical methods to remove the effects natural climate cycles such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had on rainfall variability. Their results revealed a combination of natural climate cycles and human-caused climate change that have caused this effect over the past century \u2013 with the latter accounting for around a third of the increase. The study was published in the  Journal of Climate . \"The trends in Africa of hot summers getting hotter and rainy seasons drying out are linked with factors that include increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere,\" said Dr Ming Cai, a programme director at the National Science Foundation, which funded the research.  Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \"These trends also have a devastating effect on the lives of African people, who depend on agriculture-based economies.\" Natalie Thomas, a graduate student in atmospheric and oceanic science who contributed to the research, said: \"With this study, our priority was to document the long-term trends in rainfall and temperature in the Sahara. \u201cOur next step will be to look at what is driving these trends, for the Sahara and elsewhere.\u201d The team has already started researching seasonal temperature trends closer to home, in North America. \"Here, winters are getting warmer but summers are about the same,\u201d said Ms Thomas. \u201cIn Africa, it's the opposite \u2013 winters are holding steady but summers are getting warmer.

Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile One month ago, on a bright, sunny morning, I sat in a central London office  listening to a presentation   by some of Britain\u2019s best minds on the science of the world\u2019s impending climate disaster. They spoke passionately and authoritatively as they set out in no uncertain terms quite how urgently the emergency needs tackling. They were the government\u2019s own advisers, members of the Committee on  Climate Change , and they were issuing what was the most serious warning yet for British policy-makers on the future for us all. They offered detailed analysis of exactly how the UK could \u2013 and should \u2013 eliminate all damaging emissions by 2050. The price of inaction was unthinkable, they said \u2013 and far, far higher than the cost of action. Just four days later   the UN published a report on the latest research on biodiversity and the findings were alarming. It said that wildlife is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate, with a million species facing extinction unless world leaders introduce drastic changes. AFP\/Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images REUTERS AFP\/Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images REUTERS REUTERS REUTERS Humans are putting our own future at risk by harming the very systems we rely on. Our inaction is undermining efforts to tackle poverty, to improve health and to curb climate change, the scientists said. And this week we have seen  a prediction  that human civilisation itself could end within decades if we fail to take collective action to stop temperatures  reaching 3C above pre-industrial levels . The report, co-written by a former oil and gas executive, suggests the world is ignoring plausible scenarios that would have devastating consequences. At last, you might think, world leaders and decision-makers will no longer be able to ignore the science and the advice, given the expertise and stature of those sounding the alarm and the extent of the research. Together, these reports have formed probably the greatest plea the world has ever had to tackle the twin emergencies facing our planet and everything alive on it. The authors have warned there is no time to lose. I\u2019m prepared to be disappointed. Perhaps I\u2019m being impatient, but we are a month on from that original Committee on Climate Change warning, and I have not seen a single tangible announcement or commitment in response from those with the power to act. I understand why most people, especially those of us who are non-scientists, start to switch off when warnings on extinction and climate disaster are produced. They seem too apocalyptic, too nebulous, too distant to comprehend. And most \u201cnormal\u201d people feel they can\u2019t do much about it, anyway. But if world leaders, policymakers and advisers are not scurrying behind the scenes to take action after hearing the compelling evidence about how we are sleepwalking towards catastrophe, it will be a scandal. Eight months ago, the world\u2019s leading climate scientists \u2013 the IPCC \u2013 warned that humanity has only 12 years left in which to cap temperature rises at 1.5C or face a sharply  higher risk  of drought, floods and heatwaves.   So the latest glut of evidence will hardly have come as a surprise. The UN said last week that 80 countries want to improve their pledges made under the 2015 Paris climate deal to cap temperature rises at 2C, which sounds like good news. But they are nowhere near meeting the original pledges, which still leaves the world at risk of climate chaos anyway. What is required are wholesale transformations in how we use, take from and dump back onto the Earth and its ecosystems. The solutions have been offered on a plate. But which countries have announced they are ending sales of diesel and petrol vehicles within five years? Which are seriously ramping up renewable energy sources to outweigh coal and gas? Which government is introducing a tax on meat and dairy? Where are the big new disincentives for flying? It seems national visions are nowhere near ambitious enough or urgent enough. The UK  environment  department has announced a  mass planting  of urban trees and the creation of 41 new  marine conservation zones , but these are meagre measures when,  as has been reported , the chancellor  Philip Hammond  has decided to reject the Climate Change Committee\u2019s advice.  Britain has also allowed itself to exploit previous \u201coverperformance\u201d on climate targets to relax limits in the future. These are not the actions of a \u201cworld leader\u201d on climate. Britain is one of the most nature-depleted countries and still one of the most influential. The onus is on us to be a genuine pioneer in revolutionising our food, transport and power systems, as well as our reliance on fossil fuels. The UN experts warned a month ago that wildlife was vanishing so quickly that no country could afford a business-as-usual approach. Yet indulging in business as usual is exactly what appears to be happening, our leaders sleepwalking \u2013 dragging us with them \u2013 towards an unparalleled catastrophe. Perhaps they consider the short-term financial cost a vote-loser, even if the  rise of the Green Party  in the recent European elections might help temper that assumption. Meanwhile, the price is being paid elsewhere. Our sea levels are rising and our soil is wearing out, our tigers and polar bears and songbirds are dying. Our planet is being stripped of its soul.

In a new report, a group of prominent European scientists has emphasised the importance of focusing on reducing emissions in order to meet  global warming  targets. Technologies that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere have been singled out as a major component in the struggle to keep the global temperature rise below the 2C decided in the  Paris climate agreement . However, the new report has highlighted the shortcomings of these technologies, describing expectations placed on them as \u201cseriously over-optimistic\u201d. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cWe cannot trust technology to come to the rescue,\u201d said Professor Michael Norton, co-author of the study and environment programme director at the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC). \u201cHowever the models do suggests that every tool in our toolbox may be necessary in the second half of the 21st century to tackle climate change, and so we still think it is worth considering research into negative emissions technologies.\u201d Negative emissions technologies include directly sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, and collecting it as it is released from fuel combustion. Carbon captured in this way could potentially be stored underground to prevent it re-entering the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and technologies that allow this to be done efficiently are being developed. Another, less high-tech method is simply planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has given these methods a dominant role in future plans to reduce global warming, suggesting they could make up for greenhouse gas levels breaching the allowable limits. A draft IPCC report  leaked earlier this year  said keeping warming below the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial times would \u201cinvolve removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\u201d. Without these measures, the report suggested, there is a \u201cvery high risk\u201d this ambitious target will be breached by the 2040s. While the authors of the new report acknowledged a potential role for negative emissions technologies, they emphasised that such technologies should not be elevated at the expense of efforts to minimise emissions. \u201cScenarios and projections that suggest that negative emissions technologies future contribution to carbon dioxide removal will allow Paris targets to be met appear optimistic on the basis of current knowledge, and should not form the basis of developing, analysing and comparing scenarios of longer-term energy pathways for the EU,\" stated the representatives from European science academies who authored the report. \u201cRelying on negative emissions technologies to compensate for failures to adequately mitigate emissions may have serious implications for future generations.\u201d Dr Phillip Williamson, a UK Natural Environment Research Council scientist who was not involved in the report, described it as \u201cscientifically sound and politically important\u201d. \u201cTheir main conclusion is that while some of the technologies for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may have a role to play in reducing climate change, all have drawbacks that mean it will be difficult to use them at the very large scale that would be necessary to make a real difference,\u201d said Professor Andrew Watson, an earth system scientists at the University of Exeter. \u201cSo our main focus and best hope for avoiding the worst effects of climate change still needs to be reducing our emissions.\" Other researchers acknowledged the importance of the reality check provided by the report, but noted the continued importance of research into negative emissions technologies.  \u201cNegative emission technologies only make sense in a world in which emissions are nose diving towards zero, so the EASAC\u2019s call for a commitment to strong and rapid mitigation is reasonable,\u201d said Dr Phil Renforth, a climate expert at Cardiff University. \u201cHowever, waiting until emissions reach zero before researching negative emissions is a dangerous gamble, one that may commit us to excess atmospheric carbon dioxide without scalable methods to remove it.\u201d Professor Myles Allen, a geosystem scientist at the University of Oxford, said describing the \u201climited realistic potential\u201d of carbon removal was short-sighted, and allowed people to \u201ccling to the comfort-blanket of more conventional mitigation options\u201d. \u201cThe report also ignores recent innovative policy ideas that might make large-scale carbon dioxide disposal a reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is only one institution in the world with the capital, expertise and resources to dispose of carbon dioxide on the necessary scale, and that is the fossil fuel industry. We have to work out how to give it the incentive to do so.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Historic report warns that world is a long way from taking adequate action to avoid catastrophe Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every  coral reef , the disappearance of  Arctic ice  and the  destruction of island communities , a landmark UN report has concluded. Drawing on more than 6,000 scientific studies and compiled over two years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings, released this morning, warn enormous and rapid changes to the way everyone on Earth eats, travels and produces energy need to be brought in immediately. Though the scientists behind the report said there is cause for optimism, they recognised the grim reality that nations are currently nowhere near on track to avert disaster. The worst effects of global warming will only be prevented if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years.  Under current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century. \u201cLimiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics, but doing so would require unprecedented changes,\u201d said Professor Jim Skea of Imperial College London, who contributed to the report. Another contributor, Professor Myles Allen from the University of Oxford, added: \u201cIf emissions rise above the current level then warming will accelerate, so we might even get to 1.5C earlier than this.\u201d Crucially, if the world is to avoid crossing the 1.5C threshold, CO2 emissions must be cut drastically to 45 per cent on 2010 levels by 2030, and to achieve \u201cnet zero\u201d levels by 2050. This means not only a massive switch away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but also investing in technologies that actually suck any remaining CO2 out of the air. The world has already passed 1C of warming since 19th-century industrialisation began spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and many regions are already suffering the effects as heatwaves, droughts and floods become more intense and frequent. Devised by the IPCC, the aim of the new report was to establish what the world can expect in two distinct global warming futures: 1.5C and 2C. Climate scientists used to think that 2C was a suitable level at which to cap global warming, but when the  Paris climate agreement  was settled in 2015 it reflected a changing consensus. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Its first goal was to keep global temperature rise \u201cwell below\u201d 2C, but added that nations would \u201cpursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\u201d. Many countries, particularly those  consisting of low-lying islands such as the Marshall Islands , saw any warming beyond this lower bound as  an effective death sentence  \u2013 predicting their homes would be engulfed by rising sea levels. After the summit the UN asked the IPCC to establish what the real-world difference between these two targets would be, and what would be needed to achieve them. Following a week of scientists and government delegates hashing out its final wording in the South Korean city of Incheon, the conclusions of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C were revealed to the world on Monday. Though the harm caused by 1.5C warming is not trivial, the results showed stark differences between the two targets.  Unlike 2C, the lower target will see corals decline by about 80 per cent, an ice-free Arctic summer every century and 10cm less sea level rise. This seemingly small difference in sea level rise will have a massive impact for coastal regions and islands, preventing 10 million people from losing their homes to the waves. Crucially, if the world is to avoid crossing the 1.5C threshold, carbon emissions must be cut drastically to achieve \u201cnet zero\u201d levels by 2050. This means not only a massive switch away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but also investing in technologies that suck any remaining CO2 out of the air. One of its key recommendations is that the world must arrive at \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050, meaning any CO2 entering the atmosphere must be sucked back out. The UK has already joined a 19-strong global Carbon Neutrality Coalition, which is pushing to deliver net zero emissions, and clean growth minister Claire Perry has said following the IPCC report she will ask government advisers to investigate the potential for the UK to tighten its climate targets. Labour has expressed its support for building a net zero emission economy by 2050. For UK citizens, the report will mean a big shake-up with a rapid switch to renewable energy and electric cars, changes to home insulation and massive tree-planting efforts. While Britain has made great strides in its switch to renewable energy, campaigners have criticised some aspects of UK energy policy as incompatible with the IPCC\u2019s recommendations \u2013 particularly its continued support for fracking. Carbon capture techniques may allow the world to \u201covershoot\u201d the 1.5C mark before bringing it back below the threshold, but this could be a risky strategy. While some of these measures are straightforward and proven to work \u2013 namely  \u201cnature-based\u201d methods like planting trees  \u2013 others are untested technologies that some experts fear will not meet expectations. Whatever leaders decide to do, the scientists warned that changes will need to happen fast, and they will certainly impact people\u2019s lives. Shifts towards less resource-intensive diets such as those that include less meat, and the rollout of electric cars to replace high-polluting petrol and diesel models are among the changes that will help with this transition in the coming decades. \u201cThere is not one thing you can do like going vegan that will solve everything; it will have to be a little bit of everything,\u201d said Dr Heleen de Coninck of Radboud University. \u201cThere is, however, no reason to assume we cannot lead a comfortable and fulfilling life in a 1.5C world.\u201d Dr Debra Roberts, who also contributed to the report, said in creating it they had given those in power the tools to make these important decisions. Their results will be put to the test at the next major climate change meeting this December in Poland. \u201cThe next few years are probably the most important in our history,\u201d said Dr Roberts. As key nations like the US and Australia appear to turn their backs on global climate agreements, the scientists also noted that efforts to stop warming would go hand in hand with eradicating global poverty and making the world a fairer place. The report was welcomed by experts across the scientific, business and NGO communities, who noted that the urgency of the IPCC scientists must now be mirrored by politicians.  \u201cWe have the targets, we have the solutions and the difference between impossible and possible is political leadership,\u201d said Dr Stephen Cornelius, chief advisor on climate change at WWF Professor Mark Maslin, a climatologist at University College London, said the report was nothing short of \u201crevolutionary\u201d. \u201cAt the end of this century historians will look back and realise that the IPCC 1.5C Special Report was the moment when a new vision for the 21st century emerged, leading to a safer, sustainable and more equitable world,\u201d he said.

Inadequate progress has been made in shutting down coal plants, preventing deforestation and switching to electric cars, meaning emissions are unlikely to peak next year. Experts agree that stabilising global warming below 1.5C beyond pre-industrial levels is crucial to avoid the worst results climate change including coral reef extinction and the devastation of coastal communities. However, getting there will require unprecedented changes to every aspect of society, and climate analysts have previously identified 2020 as the year when emissions need to start falling to achieve this target. But despite some progress in  renewable energy  development and climate investments around the world, the  World Resources Institute  (WRI) think tank concluded in a new report that this is unlikely to happen. (Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP Photo) (Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP Photo) (Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP Photo) (Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP Photo) (Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP Photo) The group previously identified six key areas that need to be revolutionised to achieve the ambitious target of a 2020 turning point. These sectors were energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance. \u201cProgress is uneven across the six milestones ... in most cases action is insufficient or progress is off track,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. This target was initially established by the Mission2020 coalition, which was launched by ex-UN climate chief Christiana Figueres in partnership with scientists and NGOs. When they initially laid out their plans in 2017, there was room for cautious optimism as massive declines in coal use across the US and China had caused CO2 pollution to level off. However, since then emissions have  begun to rise again , and the new WRI report reveals that many of the goals set by the coalition three years ago are not close to being realised. One target was for a fifth of new car sales being electric by 2020, and while there has been some progress towards this goal it is still expected to fall far short at around 3 per cent. Another ambitious goal was for heavy industries such as steel and cement production to be on track for compliance with the Paris agreement, meaning halving emissions by 2050. These industries produce enormous amounts of pollutants, but have proven difficult to decarbonise, and progress here has also fallen far short of the 2020 target. In particular, the authors warned that all coal-fired power plants must be retired, and the enormous scale of deforestation that is removing some of the planet\u2019s biggest carbon sinks must come to an end. There has also been a failure to ramp up agricultural practices that both reduce CO2 emissions and increase the quantity of CO2 being sucked from the atmosphere by farmland. \u201cThe report shows the pockets of significant activity where there is an opportunity to scale up and accelerate action, and we found there are many opportunities that remain untapped,\u201d Kelly Levin, one of the report\u2019s authors, told  The Independent . \u201cReaching many of the milestones is still technically feasible, but whether they are met will require exponential changes in policy, investment action and also mind set and behaviour.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A new study reveals some  birds  which are dependent on specific abundant food sources at certain times of year may not be able to adapt fast enough to the change to seasonal patterns the  climate crisis  is bringing. The research, by scientists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and  Oxford University , focused on great tits\u2019 dietary habits. Read more:  Climate crisis live - Latest updates as Biden to tackle Trump's environmental rollbacks They found that warmer winters and subsequent early springs cause trees to leaf earlier, which in turn prompts the larvae that feed on the plants to hatch earlier, and this can present a problem to the birds. Great tits are among many species which depend on an abundance of larvae available when their chicks are newly hatched and growing. Among populations of great tits, some birds\u2019 young hatch earlier than others, and in a rapidly warming world with earlier springs, to begin with, these families of tits could survive. However, using population models and comparing them against various climate change scenarios, the researchers concluded that eventually, if springs came earlier and earlier, the great tits would lose the race. \u201cWhen the climate changes, the interactions between different species changes too,\u201d said Emily Simmonds, an associate professor at NTNU\u2019s Department of Biology. \u201cIf changes happen too fast, species can become extinct. \u201cGiven conditions with big greenhouse gas emissions, the great tits won't always be able to keep up with the changes in the larvae supply,\u201d she said. The research team said in the worst case scenario, in which larvae appeared about 24 days earlier than the current norm in 2020, whole populations of great tits will simply disappear by the year 2100 because they aren\u2019t able to find enough food for their chicks. \u201cThis could happen even if great tits also modify their behaviour more quickly in a rapidly changing environment. The larvae might be changing even faster than the great tits,\u201d Ms Simmonds said. \"It could be that the apparent stability today is hiding a future collapse,\" she warned. \u201cThe reason is that we might reach a kind of threshold where the great tits aren't keeping up. The rubber band gets stretched too far, you could say. She added: \u201cThe good news is that the populations will be able to survive scenarios with lower or medium warming trends.\u201d Other populations of birds are already being directly hit by the deadly impacts of the climate crisis - in the US state of New Mexico hundreds of thousands of birds have dropped dead, and reports of mass avian fatalities have also come from Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Nebraska.  Record heatwaves, enormous wildfires and huge smoke plumes are being blamed for the deaths of numerous migratory species.  The research is published in the journal  Ecology Letters .

The global analysis of the volume of plastics being produced and polluting our planet, evaluated the means by which we may be able to achieve a global reduction in plastic pollution, and assessed the relative impacts of interventions such as banning plastic bags and straws. It is currently estimated that around eight million metric tons of plastic waste enters the world's  oceans , lakes and rivers every year. But using new mathematical models, the latest study estimates that by 2030, the annual plastic waste of 173 countries could increase to 53 million metric tons. The study modeled future scenarios to achieve a global reduction target of less than 8 million metric tons by 2030 using existing mitigation strategies which include: reducing plastic waste, which includes bans on plastic; improving waste management; and environmental clean-up. Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty EPA Getty Getty To reach this goal, the study found a 25 to 40 per cent reduction in plastic waste would be required, plastic waste management would have to increase from 6 to 60 per cent in low-income economies, and a clean-up of 40 per cent of annual plastic emissions would be needed. The study shows that unless growth in plastic production and use is halted, which the scientists described as an \u201cunlikely scenario\u201d, a fundamental transformation of the plastics economy is essential. This would mean \u201cend-of-life plastic products are valued rather than discarded as waste\u201d. Leah Gerber, professor of conservation science at  Arizona State University  and co-investigator on the study said: \u201cThere's a lot of popular attention toward clean up, but there hasn't been as much attention to the fact that we're still producing large quantities of plastic. \u201cWhere there's not good infrastructure, that plastic is making its way into marine and aquatic habitats.\u201d Plastics are slow to degrade, and even when they do, bits of them, known as microplastics, make their way into the aquatic food chain, and eventually into humans.  The \u201c Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u201d - an enormous raft of plastic waste floating in the sea is located between California and Hawaii and embodies the worsening crisis of global plastic pollution. The patch is said to cover 1.6 million square kilometres, an area about 8 times the size of Wales. The study\u2019s authors suggest that to achieve a substantial reduction in global plastic emissions requires \u201cmeaningful policy change\u201d.  This could include reducing or eliminating unnecessary plastics, establishing global limits for new plastics production, creating global standards that ensure plastics are recoverable and recyclable and developing and scaling plastic processing and recycling technologies. \u201cIn the US we\u2019re huge consumers of single-use plastic,\u201d said Professor Gerber.  \u201cI'm hopeful that our findings will get people to rethink these consumption patterns. Even here in Arizona, the choices we make impact the future of our oceans.\u201d The warning from the researchers comes amid increasing concern the rise in production of gloves, disposable masks and extra food packaging in response to the Coronavirus pandemic is already causing harm to wildlife,  according to the RSPCA .

In an interview with  The Independent  ahead of the United Nations climate change summit in Paris, Lord Stern said the conference represented a crucial opportunity to reduce the huge inequality at the heart of global warming. The huge resentment among poor countries over how they are suffering could potentially scupper a global agreement to tackle it, he explained. \u201cEquality is a big issue. The rich got rich on high-carbon growth and it\u2019s the poor people of the world \u2013 whether they be poor people in rich countries or poor people in poor countries \u2013 who suffer earliest and most,\u201d Lord Stein said. The negotiations in Paris will largely concentrate on how much money the rich nations pay to the poorer ones to help them adapt to the effects of global warming \u2013 such as increased hurricanes and droughts \u2013 and to help finance the transition from fossil fuels to green energy. The issue is fraught as developed nations with financial problems of their own baulk at channelling hundreds of billions of pounds into developing countries \u2013 which, in turn, worry that the amounts involved, though huge, are not nearly enough. Lord Stern was speaking as new research underlined how extraordinarily expensive global warming will be for developing countries \u2013 and how much less it would cost if the world redoubled its efforts to curb it. The report, commissioned by Oxfam, found that global warming is on course to cost developing countries $2.5 trillion dollars (\u00a31.65 trillion) a year by 2050. The costs relate to the huge price of adapting infrastructure to deal with a warming planet and the losses this will inflict on developing economies, for anything from extreme weather damage to disease and lost agricultural production. The report, carried out by research group Climate Analytics, factors in recent pledges made by more than 160 countries regarding 2030 targets to reduce carbon emissions \u2013 which experts estimate will limit global warming to be-tween 2.7C and 3C. But the UN has set a target of 2C because anything beyond that becomes increasingly devastating. Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty EPA Getty Getty The Oxfam report finds that the cost to the developing world of dealing with 2C warming is huge. The extra 1C increases their cost of adaptation by about $270bn a year by 2050 and deals a further $600bn of annual economic losses. \u201cWe are seeing encouraging progress towards a climate deal but settling for what we have so far would spell disaster for the world\u2019s poorest people,\u201d said Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Mark Goldring. \u201cOne degree\u2019s difference might seem negligible but it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar nightmare for the world\u2019s poorest countries.\u201d World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim said parts of Africa were among those areas most in need of financial help. \u201cSub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate shocks that could have far-ranging impact on everything from child stunting and malaria to food price increases,\u201d he said. Children are disproportionately at risk from global warming, with more than half a billion living in areas of high flood risk and 160 million in drought-prone regions, according to Unicef, the children\u2019s charity. \u201cThe sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now,\u201d said Unicef executive director Anthony Lake. Lord Stern urged world leaders to tackle these global warming inequalities at the UN conference, which begins on November 30. \u201c[Paris] is in large measure about showing the rich world is serious about its promises. It is important. It\u2019s got to show that it\u2019s on the way [to providing $100bn of finance a year by 2020] and that it is likely to continue to be on the way,\u201d Lord Stern said. \u201cThe defining challenges of this century are overcoming poverty and managing climate change: if we fail on one we fail on the other. Clearly if we fail to manage climate change we create an environment so hostile that development will be undermined \u2013 leading to hundreds of millions having to move because their environment has been devastated. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to see the ravages of climate change as likely to move people on a very big scale. Unmanaged climate change is likely to produce strong movement of people and great conflict, the reasons for which could not easily be switched off,\u201d Lord Stern said.

Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said he was optimistic that this \u201cheightened awareness\u201d would lead to crucial action to avoid the most devastating impacts of global warming. But he warned there was still much work to do and that it remained to be seen whether world leaders could agree an effective deal to curb emissions at a crucial UN meeting in Paris in December next year. Dr Pachauri was speaking after addressing the biggest gathering of world leaders \u2013 125, including David Cameron and President Obama \u2013 ever assembled to discuss climate change, in New York today. This UN summit came hard on the heels of more than 2,700 climate change marches in 161 countries over the weekend. \u201cI see a clearly heightened awareness of climate change and what that means for people\u2019s livelihoods around the world. The marches were quite unprecedented, as is this high-level summit. It could very well be a turning point \u2013 I am optimistic that from now onwards we will see global society moving towards a solution,\u201d Dr Pachauri told The Independent. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to predict what happens next because these things are so complex but the signs look encouraging and I would be surprised if we didn\u2019t get a good agreement at Paris,\u201d he added. The battle to curb climate change took a major step forward at the UN conference, as global leaders pledged dramatic action to eliminate deforestation. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy and Climate Change Secretary, also agreed that the world seems to have reached a tipping point in the battle against climate change. \u201cThe marches have been an important part of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at a really critical moment. I am more optimistic than I have been before, we are absolutely in a better place than we\u2019ve been before.\" The so-called New York Declaration \u2013 signed by 50 governments and sub-governments around the world, including the UK and the US \u2013 promises to cut the rate of deforestation in half by 2020 and to halt it altogether 10 years later. Over the same period, an area of dilapidated forestland bigger than India will be restored, meaning that towards 2030 the number of trees in the world will actually be increasing. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who convened the summit, said: \u201cI asked for countries and companies to build bold pledges, and here they are. The New York declaration aims to reduce more climate pollution each year than the United States emits annually.\u201d \u201cThis is a serious commitment for a serious challenge,\u201d added Heru Prasetyo, head of Indonesia\u2019s REDD+ Agency, which is concerned with reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. If successful, the move will reduce global emissions by between 4.5 and 8.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year \u2013 about 15 per cent of the 40bn tonnes forecast to be emitted this year. It is also the equivalent of removing the world\u2019s 1bn cars from the roads. The UN also announced a new initiative to accelerate the transition to more efficient appliances and equipment to reduce energy demand. A worldwide shift to energy-efficient appliances and equipment \u2013 including lighting, air conditioners, refrigerators, electric motors and ceiling fans \u2013 would reduce global electricity consumption by more than 10 per cent, saving $350bn annually in electricity bills and reducing global emissions by 1.25bn tonnes a year.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in A study last year found that not having children was one of the most effective ways of reducing carbon emissions, but others say meaningful change has to start at policy level Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile As of the start of this month, we have consumed as much of the Earth\u2019s natural resources so far in 2018 as we should have done for an entire year. This includes food, water and carbon, according to research organisation Global Footprint Network, which also estimates that we\u2019d need the equivalent of 1.7 Earths to maintain current consumption levels.  It sounds scary, but statistics like this are unlikely to compel you to leave your car at work this evening and take the bus home. We\u2019re inundated every day with predictions and terrifying data on the damage we\u2019re causing to the planet, but they lose their edge in a world where we have very tangible problems to deal with in our everyday lives, and for a long time, they\u2019ve remained too abstract to scare individuals and governments into enacting enough change to reverse trends. But now the stakes are getting personal and we\u2019re starting to listen.  There\u2019s an argument steadily gaining ground suggesting that \u2013 since individuals in developed nations have huge carbon footprints, with all the eating, driving, flying and keeping warm we do \u2013 the best way to avoid this damage is to consider having fewer  children , or none at all. And the proliferating organisations arguing we should consider smaller families are being bolstered by recent reports. A  major study  last year concluded that not having children is one of the most effective ways of cutting our  carbon footprint , and that a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who recycle for the rest of their lives.  Last year researchers recommended four ways to contribute to lowering our emissions, including having one fewer child \u2013 the equivalent of 58.6 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. The other three suggestions \u2013 avoiding aeroplane travel, ditching the car and eating a plant-based diet \u2013 totalled a fraction of the emissions of having a child.  One couple taking this seriously are George Mann and Nir Paldi, artistic directors of theatre company Ad Infinitum. They\u2019re currently touring their play  No Kids , based on their own experience of deciding how, and if, to have children. They consider surrogacy, which doesn\u2019t solve the problem of adding to our carbon footprint, and  adoption , which they say is a much more complex process than they\u2019d imagined.  As a same-sex couple, Paldi says the extra effort they have to put into having a child makes them question the process even more than a straight, fertile couple. \u201cWe met with adoption recruiters and charities as part of our research for the play and found out how much of a serious undertaking it is. It\u2019s less of an option for us to achieve a happy family than we\u2019d hoped\u201d, Paldi says.  The couple admit they haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions yet, and while the process has made Mann more passionate about the  environment , he\u2019s realised how much this is in conflict with his deeper desire to have children.  \u201cIt\u2019s brought me face-to-face with this contradiction, with the flaws of human nature that we all have inside,\u201d he says.  If they decide to not have children, Paldi and Mann would be contributing to part of a wider trend of falling birth rates in the UK, as well as in the US. But the UK should still be leading the way, according to Florence Blondel of  Population Matters , an organisation that promotes smaller families. She argues it\u2019s crucial to send a message to developing nations, where population growth continues to rise, from countries such as the UK, where she came three years ago to study from her home in Uganda.  \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the UK, because you also have migration here; people come here with their children. You need to be successful here in order to take the message to  developing countries , otherwise people would just be suspicious. The UK needs to be an example,\u201d she says.  Blondel, who comes from a family of seven children, says that, while she loves her siblings, she doesn\u2019t think children should be born into inevitable suffering.  \u201cWhy have a child to struggle through life? I\u2019m over 30 years old already and I don\u2019t have any children yet \u2013 and I come from a country where people start having children aged 15, 16. I\u2019m definitely not going to have more than two children.\u201d The debate is often narrowed to one of population control, but other organisations argue this is part of a much wider debate.  Conceivable Future , a US organisation encouraging conversations around  climate change , has grown accustomed to being mentioned in articles arguing the need for population controls.  Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Founders Josephine Ferorelli and Meghan Kallman, however, argue that the question shouldn\u2019t be whether people have fewer children because of their future carbon footprint, but why we live on a planet where there is such a carbon cost to having a child.  \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous to think a bunch of people deciding not to have children will solve climate change. I could kill myself now, remove myself as one of around seven billion people, and climate change would continue. It\u2019s a socially and morally bankrupt argument,\u201d Kallman says.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about individuals choosing to do something or not do something, but about people coming together. If you look at the civil rights movement, the only reason the Montgomery bus boycott worked was because people did it en masse.\u201d Mann disagrees, and argues individual change is the first step of a bigger political movement.  \u201cYou always have to start small,\u201d Mann says. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered couples who\u2019ve decided not to have children for environmental reasons and it does have an impact. When this grows to more people, it will be more impactful.\u201d Paldi says it\u2019s futile to argue that there\u2019s no point adopting sustainable behaviours when others don\u2019t bother to. \u201cIt\u2019s not unethical to ask someone whether they really need to have a fourth child,\u201d he says. \u201cNot having a child makes a significant impact and, if quite a few people do it, it makes a big difference.\u201d But Rivka Weinberg, a philosopher and the author of the book  The Risk of a Lifetime: How, When, and Why Procreation May Be Permissible , doesn\u2019t think we can do much to improve climate change by having smaller families, and that change can only happen from a policy level.  \u201cSome people are saying you can\u2019t have children and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s at all fair. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have a wonderful life as a childless person, but you can\u2019t understate the effects of having children; it\u2019s visceral, it\u2019s a special relationship that no other relationship will substitute,\u201d she says.  Another argument for having fewer children is how dangerous the world will be for future generations, which Weinberg says is the more pressing issue.  \u201cOn an individual level, each person has to decide whether it\u2019s morally permissible for them to have children and climate change makes that a harder choice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt presents future children with more risks that parents are ill-equipped to do anything about.\u201d While climate change currently affects those in developing countries the most \u2013 in Vietnam, for example, the average temperature has risen by 0.5\u00b0C over the past 50 years, and sea levels have risen by about 20cm \u2013 she says at some point it will affect us all. But deciding not to have children would be a \u201cpremature reaction\u201d now, she adds, because there\u2019s still time to adapt.   \u201cTo say someone shouldn\u2019t have children is very premature and unfair \u2013 there are other things we can do first, there are less draconian ways of approaching the problem.\u201d And when it comes to fighting for political change, Josephine says, ironically, having children can help.  \u201cFor the most effective activists, their reason for doing this work is because of their children.\u201d Rebecca Kukla, associate professor of philosophy at Carleton University in Ottawa, says we need clarity around the fact that industry and infrastructural systems are the main threat to the environment, and not individuals.  \u201cOur primary goal, if we want to protect the environment, should be on systems-level reforms, infrastructural development, and strong checks on industry. Even more basically, our goal should be reducing income inequality and poverty, since it is really people in poor and disempowered regions that are under serious threat from climate change,\u201d she says.  \u201cAll these discussions about lifestyle choices should be put in perspective. Anyone who chooses not to have a child for environmental reasons should be fully aware of the scientific facts as we know them, including all the facts showing that individual lifestyle choices are not really the main things that need to change.  \u201cOf course, corporations and capitalist institutions are motivated to hide these facts, and it would indeed be deeply troubling if people gave up the chance to parent based on misleading propaganda.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The letter is based on climate science that was first established in 1979 at the first World Climate Conference held in Geneva. For decades multiple global bodies have agreed urgent action is needed but greenhouse gas  emissions  continue to rise.  \u201cDespite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have continued to conduct business as usual and have failed to address this crisis,\u201d said William Ripple, professor of ecology at Oregon State University, who spearheaded the letter.  \u201cClimate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected,\u201d according to the letter published in  BioScience .  Researchers say they have a moral obligation to \u201cclearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat\u201d and \u201ctell it like it is\u201d. \u201cClearly and unequivocally planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,\u201d they state.

Backward steps include rising meat consumption, more air travel, chopping down forests faster than ever and increase in global carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists say they want the public to \u201cunderstand the magnitude of this crisis, track progress, and realign priorities for alleviating climate change\u201d. To do so will require major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems, they say. The letter focuses on six key objectives: replacing fossil fuels; cutting pollutants like methane and soot; restoring and protecting ecosystems; eating less meat; converting the economy to one that is carbon-free and stabilising population growth. \u201cGlobal surface temperature, ocean heat content, extreme weather and its costs, sea level, ocean acidity and land area are all rising,\u201d Professor Ripple said. \u201cIce is rapidly disappearing as shown by declining trends in minimum summer Arctic sea ice, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and glacier thickness. All of these rapid changes highlight the urgent need for action.\u201d Lead author, Dr Thomas Newsome from the University of Sydney, said measuring global surface temperatures remained important but that a broader set of indicators should be monitored.  This includes \u201chuman population growth, meat consumption, tree-cover loss, energy consumption, fossil-fuel subsidies and annual economic losses to extreme weather events\u201d, he said.  \u201cWhile things are bad, all is not hopeless. We can take steps to address the climate emergency,\u201d he said.  The authors say that despite the gloomy outlook there is room for optimism.  \u201cWe are encouraged by a recent surge of concern. Governmental bodies are making climate emergency declarations,\u201d they write.  \u201cSchoolchildren are striking. Ecocide lawsuits are proceeding in the courts.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Air transport and an expanding demand for luxury travel mean the\u00a0impact of the high-polluting industry is likely to continue growing Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Tourism  accounts for around 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new study that marks the first attempt to quantify the industry\u2019s total carbon footprint. In an ambitious paper  published in the scientific journal  Nature Climate Change , an international team of scientists has quantified the environmental impact of everything from transatlantic flights to cheap souvenirs. The researchers said flying less and investing in payment schemes to offset damage caused by travel will be essential to avoid \u201cunchecked future growth in tourism-related emissions\u201d. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the countries causing the most harm were also among the largest in both wealth and size \u2013 with the US, China and Germany topping the rankings. Air travel was the main culprit, and the researchers suggested the high-polluting industry would become increasingly problematic as the world gets richer and there is more demand for luxury travel.  The global tourism industry as a whole has been growing at an annual rate of around 5 per cent, outpacing the growth of international trade. \u201cOur analysis is a world-first look at the true cost of tourism \u2013 including consumables such as food from eating out and souvenirs \u2013 it\u2019s a complete life-cycle assessment of global tourism, ensuring we don\u2019t miss any impacts,\u201d said Dr Arunima Malik, a sustainability expert at the University of Sydney. \u201cThis research fills a crucial gap identified by the World Tourism Organisation and World Meteorological Organisation to quantify, in a comprehensive manner, the world\u2019s tourism footprint.\u201d Their study quantified the carbon footprints of tourism operations \u2013 including transport, events, hotels, food and shopping \u2013 in 189 countries, as well as the relevant upstream supply chains. According to Dr Malik, the work took a year and a half to complete and involved the estimation of the climate impact of one billion supply chains. Previous research has only looked at specific regions or a more limited selection of tourism activities \u2013 resulting in emissions estimates that were about a quarter of the new figure produced by Dr Malik and her colleagues. As it stands, at least 15 per cent of tourism-related emissions do not face any binding emissions targets, as emissions from both international aviation and bunker shipping are excluded from the Paris climate agreement. To make matters worse, US President Donald Trump \u2013 leader of the world\u2019s biggest source of tourism emissions \u2013 does not support the Paris agreement and  has expressed doubts over the very existence of climate change . Coauthor Dr Ya-Yen Sun, from the University of Queensland, said a move towards \u201clow impact\u201d tourism will be crucial as the industry is expected to go from strength to strength in the coming years. \u201cGiven that tourism is set to grow faster than many other economic sectors, the international community may consider its inclusion in the future in climate commitments, such as the Paris accord, by tying international flights to specific nations,\u201d she said. \u201cCarbon taxes or carbon trading schemes \u2013 in particular for aviation \u2013 may be required to curtail unchecked future growth in tourism-related emissions.\u201d Professor Manfred Lenzen, lead researcher from the University of Sydney, said holidaymakers can take steps to ensure their travel is cleaner and does less harm to the planet. \u201cTo make my own travel more sustainable \u2013 for future generations \u2013 I invest in long-run abatement options at prices that incorporate at least average abatement costs, like investing in afforestation, rather than assuming only low-hanging fruit, like residential power efficiency,\u201d said Professor Lenzen. However, he added that such measures are not cheap. \u201cIf I flew from Melbourne to the UK return, I would pay at least an additional $425 (\u00a3237) to offset my emissions; for a return trip between Sydney and Brisbane, about $45 (\u00a325) extra,\u201d he said. The authors said many nations have regarded tourism as a relatively low-impact development option, leading them to invest massively in infrastructure to draw in tourists.  This mindset has seen nations including Japan, Nepal and Hungary attempting to double visitor numbers over short periods of time. However, the researchers warned this view is misguided, as their analysis shows that tourism is significantly more carbon intensive than other potential forms of economic development. The tourism industry stands to lose a lot in a changing climate. As temperatures rise, snow and ice could become less reliable in places that depend on them to draw tourists \u2013  such as ski resorts and \u201cwinter wonderlands\u201d like Finnish Lapland . Meanwhile, rising sea levels threaten the coastal infrastructure that characterises many tropical and island resorts, and natural wonders like the  Great Barrier Reef  will likely draw fewer visitors if global warming leaves them shadows of their former selves. Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray Lisa Murray The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has previously recommended measures to combat tourism-related emissions \u2013 encouraging travellers to avoid long-haul flights and incentivising tourism operators to improve their energy and carbon efficiency. In their paper, the researchers concluded these measures have been largely ineffective. As UNWTO is pushing for more tourism growth, even in highly developed tourism regions, they recommended their findings should be taken into consideration by the international body. However, they also recognised that for many nations \u2013 particularly remote island countries or those whose economies are dependent on tourists \u2013 moving away from air travel and other harmful aspects of the industry will be a challenge. Due to their small populations, tourism is responsible for up to 80 per cent of the emissions of island nations like the Maldives and Mauritius. The authors suggested that channelling financial and technical assistance from wealthier countries could be a means of sharing the burden with such nations, and would allow them to prepare for the future.

Increasing heat, accelerating sea level rises, and extreme weather in 2019 were all indications of the impact of failing to rein in carbon emissions, said a report compiled by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The agency warned urgent and far-reaching climate action was needed if the world was to limit global warming to 1.5C or 2C, as required under the international Paris Agreement on  climate change . Last year was  the second hottest year on record , with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels, the report confirms. The years from 2015 to 2019 were the five warmest on record and the last decade was the hottest since records began in the 19th century. Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Reuters\/Hannah McKay Each decade since the 1980s has been hotter than any preceding decade stretching back to 1850, according to the WMO\u2019s report, which has input from national meteorological services, international experts, scientific institutions and other UN agencies. Those trends have continued in 2020. January was the warmest on record globally and Europe saw \u201cby far\u201d its hottest winter to date, according to the EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service. New temperature highs have been reported in Antarctica, along with large-scale ice melts and a fracturing glacier which will have \"repercussions for sea level rise\", WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas warned. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are expected to increase their action this year to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the worst impacts of global warming. In a foreword to the report, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said: \"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for. \"This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action.\" Prof Taalas said: \"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue.\" He added it was an only matter of time before the world a new record hot year \u2013 with predictions it will come within five years. Alongside temperature increases, rainfall changes are having a major impact on several countries and sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and submersion, the report said. Preliminary data indicates greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere continued to rise in 2019, and carbon emissions from global fossil fuels grew 0.6 per cent last year. The report detailed the harmful impacts on people and wildlife caused by surging temperatures across the world. There were two major heatwaves in Europe, in June and July, with new national temperature records set in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. Climate change is facilitating the spread of dengue fever, with around half the world population now at risk of infection and a large increase in cases in 2019, the report noted. World hunger is on the rise again, and an estimated 22 million people worldwide were forced to leave their homes by events such as floods and storms, the WMO added.

Drought or low rainfall hit many parts of the world, including Australia, which also saw its hottest year and December on record and an  exceptionally long and severe season of wildfires . Some parts of the Arctic  also burned in wildfires  \u2013 an extremely rare occurrence \u2013 and sea ice in the region continued to decline. The Greenland ice sheet lost 329 billion tonnes of ice in 2019, well above the average for recent years, and glaciers continue to melt. Sea levels rose to record highs last year, and at least 84 per cent of the oceans experienced at least one marine heatwave. Warming ocean temperatures, along with more acidic water and lower oxygen levels, are having an impact on marine wildlife and habitats such as coral, the report said. Another report  published by climate think tank Ember this week warned countries must \"dramatically accelerate\" a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy to have any chance of meeting Paris Agreement targets.

Back-to-back major coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 resulted in the death of around half of the entire 133,360-square-mile structure due to marine heatwaves exacerbated by rising global temperatures. \u201cThe current rate of global warming will not allow the maintenance of a healthy reef for future generations,\u201d the report said, stating \u201cthe window of opportunity to improve the reef\u2019s long-term future is now\u201d.  \u201cSignificant global action to address climate change is critical to slowing the deterioration of the reef\u2019s ecosystem and heritage values and supporting recovery,\u201d the authors said. \u201cSuch actions will complement and greatly increase the effectiveness of local management actions in the reef and its catchment.\u201d AFP\/Getty Getty\/iStock AFP\/Gett Getty H Goehlich Getty\/Lumix Getty\/iStock AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Nature Seychelles AFP\/Getty C Reveret AFP\/Getty Getty\/Tourism Queensland AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty\/Lumix AFP\/Getty Sarah Frias-Torres  AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty The report comes as Australia\u2019s government has published figures indicating its greenhouse gas emissions have hit a seven-year high.  Other major threats to the reef include coastal development, farming pollution and illegal fishing. The report is the third of its kind and monitors the continuing damage and degradation to the  Unesco  World Heritage site.  The report reflects the expanding area of coral killed or damaged by the severe bleaching events in recent years. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chairman Ian Poiner said: \u201cThe accumulation of impacts, through time and over an increasing area, is reducing its ability to recover from disturbances, with implications for reef-dependent communities and industries. \u201cThe overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is very poor.\u201d The authority\u2019s chief scientist David Wachenfeld said in a statement: \u201cGradual sea temperature increase and extremes, such as marine heatwaves, are the most immediate threats to the reef as a whole and pose the highest risk.  \u201cGlobal action on climate change is critical.\u201d The United Nations World Heritage Committee expressed concern about bleaching in 2017 and the latest report could lead to the reef being reclassified by Unesco next year as \u201cin danger\u201d. Australian environment minister  Sussan Ley  said she was not surprised by the downgrade in the reef\u2019s condition given the damage done by recent cyclones and bleaching events over successive years. She said her government is \u201cbuilding resilience in this important global reef\u201d and is keeping its Paris commitment to reduce Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. \u201cI want to make the point that it\u2019s the best managed reef in the world,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are those who will not be happy unless we declare the reef dead in the name of climate change, just as there are those who want to claim that nothing out of the ordinary is taking place,\u201d she wrote in  an opinion piece  for the  Sydney Morning Herald  titled \u201cThe Great Barrier Reef is not dead... long live the reef\u201d.

In the first index of its kind, published on Friday, UN children\u2019s agency  UNICEF  found that almost all the world\u2019s 2.2 billion children are exposed to at least one climate or environmental risk, from catastrophic floods to toxic air. Last week a UN climate panel of the world\u2019s top atmospheric scientists warned that global warming is dangerously close to spiralling out of control, with deadly heat waves, hurricanes and other extreme events likely to keep getting worse. Ms Thunberg, 18, said the UNICEF index confirmed children would be the worst affected, and when world leaders meet in  Glasgow  in November for COP26 they needed to act rather than just talk. \u201cI don\u2019t expect them to do that, but I would be more than happy if they could prove me wrong,\u201d she told journalists ahead of the index\u2019s publication on the third anniversary of Fridays For Future, a now-global youth movement that started with her solo protest outside her Swedish school. Ms Thunberg was joined by young activists around the world including Mitzi Jonelle Tan, 23, from the Philippines, who spoke of doing homework by candlelight as typhoons raged outside or fearing drowning in her bed as floodwaters filled her room. After months of extreme weather and dire warnings from scientists, world leaders\u2019 \u201cempty promises and vague plans\u201d were no longer enough, Ms Tan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for this COP... to not be the one that changes things.\u201d Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director said young people globally were leading by example, pointing to a survey by the organisation that found nine in ten of them in 21 countries felt it was their responsibility to tackle climate change. They were more at risk than adults in the \u201cincreasingly unrecognisable\u201d world they stood to inherit, she said, being less able to survive extreme weather events and more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and disease. The UNICEF index showed around one billion children in 33 mostly  Africa n low-emission countries faced a \u201cdeadly combination\u201d of extreme weather and existing issues like poverty, making them uniquely vulnerable.

The only mention of the environment is a reference to cleaning the air and sea. \"Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment,\" the page reads. \"Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority.\" The document also says that President Trump will \"refocus\" the Environmental Protection Agency \"on its essential mission of protecting our air and water\".

He called on business and political leaders to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the crisis at the Davos summit back in January. Last month a study suggested the global lockdown will have a \"negligible\" impact on rising temperatures but a green recovery could avert dangerous climate change. Experts led by the University of Leeds found that lockdowns caused a fall in transport use, as well as reductions in industry and commercial operations, cutting the greenhouse gases and pollutants caused by vehicles and other activities. However the impact is only short-lived, with analysis showing that even if some measures last until the end of 2021, global temperatures will only be 0.01C lower than expected by 2030.

Such, anyway, was the case for Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University, when he was invited to appear on  Joe Rogan \u2019s wildly popular podcast on Wednesday. Dr Dessler, who has a PhD in  chemistry  from Harvard and has worked for Nasa, said that there wasn\u2019t much time to ponder whether to appear on  The Joe Rogan Experience , which has been the source of recent  misinformation controversies  over Covid-19 and climate change.  \u201c[Joe Rogan] asked me on Sunday afternoon,\u201d Dr Dessler told The Independent . \u201cIf he\u2019d asked longer in advance, I might not have done it but the timeline was so short, I agreed before I thought about it.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s very controversial, I understand that. But his audience is too large, and it was too good of an opportunity to try to get the message out about climate change. I viewed that as being the most important factor.\u201d In a typically lengthy episode \u2013 lasting two hours, 12 minutes \u2013 the scientist and Rogan had a wide-ranging discussion on climate change which jumped from plummeting costs of renewable energy to deadly air pollution from fossil fuels, and the efficacy of debating scientific facts.  Dr Dessler said that he was happy with the interview overall but called it one of the \u201cmost challenging\u201d he had ever done. \u201cIn any two-hour interview, you\u2019re going to say things that you regret later. I shouldn\u2019t have brought up cryptocurrency \u2013 that was a mistake,\u201d he noted. (Dr Dessler had pointed out that cryptocurrency mining is an  energy intensive process, among other remarks,  which has provoked the ire of the very vocal Twitter crypto community.) He continued: \u201cThat said, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that I got the message out, and that people will hear it and understand how solid climate science is, how good renewable energy is, and how bad fossil fuels are.  \u201cAnd, that this is a problem we can solve \u2013 that\u2019s really the message. It\u2019s not a scientific or technical problem. It\u2019s a political problem.\u201d Rogan has aired several episodes with guests discussing climate change since the start of the year.  By some metrics , his show gets 11 million downloads per episode. In January, Dr  Jordan Peterson , a clinical psychiatrist and author who is not a climate scientist, used the platform to claim that climate science has no basis in reality, and that solar power kills more people than nuclear.  Last week, Rogan\u2019s guest was Dr Steven Koonin, a physicist and former chief scientist for BP who served in the Obama administration. His book,  Unsettled , argues the consensus on climate change is less clear than commonly thought. A review by  Scientific American  described the book as \u201cmaking distracting, irrelevant, misguided, misleading and unqualified statements about supposed uncertainties that he thinks scientists have buried under the rug\u201d. (Last year  a review of 90,000 academic papers on climate change  found that 99.9 per cent of scientists were in agreement that humans were causing the crisis, a level of scientific certainty on par with evolution.) Spotify , a Swedish-based, public company, has faced increased scrutiny over its responsibility for misinformation and pseudoscience on the platform, issues which have long plagued other tech giants like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. At the heart of the furore is Rogan, a stand-up comedian and UFC commentator, with the platform\u2019s most popular show. Spotify paid a reported $200m for its exclusive rights, according to  The New York Times . The rock star  Neil Young  was the first of several high-profile musicians who asked Spotify to remove his song catalogue due to repeated Covid misinformation on Rogan\u2019s podcast. Singer-songwriter India.Arie asked for her music to be removed due to Rogan\u2019s \u201cproblematic language around race\u201d.  Spotify has said that it is committed to free speech but also removed past episodes of Rogan\u2019s show. The company\u2019s content guidelines have also been made public, and \u201ccontent advisories\u201d would be added to Covid episodes. On Thursday,  Rogan posted to Instagram : \u201c2 perspectives on climate change. Steven Koonin, physicist, who wrote the book \u201cunsettled\u201d and Andrew Dessler climate scientist and Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University. Both had a completely different perspective.\u201d While many followers posted with praise for Rogan, one user responded: \u201cMaybe next week you could show the different perspectives of the holocaust? Or gravity?\u201d On Wednesday\u2019s show, Rogan appeared genuinely astonished by some facts provided by Dr Dessler including when he refuted Dr Koonin\u2019s earlier claim that fossil fuels were the cheapest energy sources. The professor noted that, at times, Texas generates half its power from wind turbines. (Dr Dessler later shared data from the Texas power grid, ERCOT, on his  Twitter account.) The day after the interview aired, and following a negative barrage on social media, Dr Dessler told  The Independent  that a lot of people had out-of-date views on renewables. \u201cI don\u2019t blame people because renewable energy is changing so fast,\u201d he said. \u201cLast March wind and solar were over 40 per cent of [Texas] power. To be clear, it doesn\u2019t always generate that much power \u2013 the spring is the period where wind and solar generate the highest fraction. But still, it\u2019s generating enormous amounts.  \u201cPeople just don\u2019t believe it because their knowledge is, for example, from 2015 when Texas didn\u2019t have nearly as much renewable energy. And when I say wind and solar are the cheapest, maybe they\u2019re thinking 2010, when solar was the most expensive form of energy.\u201d Dr Dessler also appeared to shock Rogan as he listed the myriad negative consequences of burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. He pointed out that coal kills millions of people from air pollution globally, including tens of thousands of Americans, due to the small particulate matter, called PM2.5, which buries deep into lungs, and then transfers to the blood stream. PM2.5 has been linked to  cancers, heart attacks and strokes . \u201cIt\u2019s another impact of fossil fuels that anti-climate people leave out of their arguments,\u201d Dr Dessler added. Towards the end of the interview, Rogan asked the climate scientist if he would be interested in a debate with Dr Koonin. Dr Dessler said that while he wouldn\u2019t debate science which \u201chas already been debated in the scientific system\u201d, he would be \u201chappy to debate policy\u201d. Rogan replied that a debate on the science would be \u201cvery beneficial\u201d for the \u201caverage person\u201d, to which Dr Dessler strongly disagreed. Later, the college professor mulled over if he had made his point well, saying that he had a \u201clot of hate mail\u201d on the subject. But he remained firm, saying that it was\u201cthe goal of the fossil fuel industry to keep the idea of [scientific] debate alive\u201d. \u201cFor people who don\u2019t want to take action on climate, it allows them to continue to insist there\u2019s a debate \u2013 because you just had a debate! I still feel strongly it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d he said.  Given the opportunity, Dr Dessler said he would likely accept an invitation to go on Rogan\u2019s podcast again, to be part of helping to further understanding of the  climate crisis . \u201cI think this one event probably reached more people than everything I've done in my entire career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's probably 10 or 100 times more people. I've given a lot of talks to 10 or 20 people over the years. \u201cI think you can't overstate the importance of taking advantage of those kind of platforms when they become available.

Intended as a distant warning about the escalating threat of  climate change , one clip featured high profile weather forecaster Evelyne Dheliat alongside a map showing summertime temperatures in France hitting highs of up to 42C.  But just five years later, real weather forecasts by Ms Dheliat show the future appears to have arrived decades early.  An image shared widely on social media following last week\u2019s European heatwave shows a striking similarity between the fictional temperatures of August 2050 and the very real weather faced today.  Although the 2019 image was apparently taken from a weather report in late June, when  France recorded its first ever 46C high , last week saw similar scorching temperatures, including in Paris, which  saw its hottest day on 25 July .  In the fictional 2014 report, Paris is shown at 26C in the morning, before rising to 40C after midday. Last Thursday, the French capital hit a far more extreme 34C by 10am, before reaching its record 42.6C in the late afternoon.  The comparison between the present and 2014's dystopian weather report was first made by French weekly  L\u2019Obs . The unprecedented heat in France last week was mirrored across much of northern Europe, where one by one temperature records tumbled. Holland beat its national record that had stood since 1944 with a reading of 39.3C in Eindhoven, while a temperature of 40.7C in Beitem broke Belgium\u2019s record. Although no single weather event can be directly attributed to climate change, climate scientists warn global carbon emissions make extreme heatwaves far more likely.  A study last month by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research revealed the five hottest summers in Europe since 1500 have come since 2002.

Currently, cows and sheep are typically grazed in the north and west of Britain but, by 2100, warmer temperatures could force farmers to switch to more profitable arable  farming .  Without significant irrigation, large swathes of the south and east of the country could become too dry for crops and, instead, be better suited to low-density livestock farming, according to new research.  If emissions continue at current rates, Britain will be 5C warmer by the end of the century, and would experience up to 140mm less rainfall during the growing season between April and September, according to the  paper published in the journal  Environmental Research Letters . Lead researcher Professor Tim Lenton, from the University of Exeter, said this level of climate change would result in a transformation of the country\u2019s landscape. AFP\/Getty Images PA Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com SWNS SWNS Getty Images PA Getty Images Getty Images SWNS PA PA AFP\/Getty Images EPA PA PA AFP\/Getty Images Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com Dan Rowlands \/ SWNS.com He told  The Independent:  \u201cWe\u2019re moving towards a more French or Spanish summer climate.  \u201cThe east and southeast will be a parched grassland in the summer and, if there is livestock on it, it will be low stocking level. The lowland grassland plains will be much drier than we\u2019re used to and probably won\u2019t sustain wheat production because they will just be too dry.  \u201cThis is unlike the lush grasslands that can support high stocking densities in the UK at the moment.\u201d Agriculture accounts for 72 per cent of land use in the UK and employs around 1 million people. Arable farming is generally more profitable than livestock farming, but poor soils and steep slopes in the north mean that it is currently often not a viable option.  Although the overall picture is bad for farming, livestock farmers that are able to switch to arable farming might do better.  Dr Paul Ritchie, from the University of Exeter, said: \u201cBritain is relatively cool and damp, so a warmer and drier growing season is generally expected to increase arable production. \u201cCrops could still be grown with the aid of irrigation, but this would involve either storing large quantities of winter rainfall or transporting water from wetter parts of the country. The amount of water required would be vast, representing a major challenge for UK agriculture.\u201d Part of the impact of warmer conditions could be offset by higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2013 meaning plants will be able to use water more efficiently. This is because an enzyme contained in plants is more efficient when there is less oxygen in the atmosphere.  Researchers say this is a crucial uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on farming land-use and needs to be researched further.

The WHO\u2019s report, issued in the run-up to the UN Cop26 conference in Glasgow where countries will be under pressure to raise ambition on tackling climate change, warns it is the  single biggest health threat facing humanity . The climate crisis threatens to undo the past 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, it says. Climate change is leading to  death and illness  from increasingly extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods, disruptions to food systems, increases in disease spread and  mental health issues . Fossil fuels are fuelling the climate crisis, as well as causing millions of premature deaths every year from air pollutants, the report said. It calls for governments to commit to a green, healthy recovery from the pandemic, making sure efforts are aligned to the goals of the global Paris Agreement on tackling climate change, focus on 100% green stimulus spending and end fossil fuel subsidies. The WHO report also calls for action to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic, commit to vaccine equality and address inequalities at the root of the current climate and health crises. The climate crisis has caused mass deaths worldwide  The report lays out further recommendations to deal with climate change, including prioritising action with the largest health, social and economic gains, promoting sustainable and healthy cities, and transport and food systems, restoring nature, and moving to an  economy based more on wellbeing . \u201cThe burning of fossil fuels is killing us,\u201d the WHO report said, and also warned: \u201cClimate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity.\u201d While no one was safe from the health impacts of climate change, they were disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, it added. An open letter from 300 organisations representing at least 45 million doctors and health professionals worldwide has been published alongside the report, calling for leaders and negotiators at Cop26 to step up climate action. The letter, signed by dozens of UK organisations including the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and Save the Children, warns that health professionals are already responding to harms caused by climate change. It urges governments to take action to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change are set to be felt. The letter urges: \u201cWe call on the leaders of every country and their representatives at Cop26 to avert the impending health catastrophe by limiting global warming to 1.5C, and to make human health and equity central to all climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.\u201d As the report and letter were released, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said: \u201c The Covid-19 pandemic  has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment. \u201cThe same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people. \u201cWHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at Cop26 to limit global warming to 1.5C - not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because it\u2019s in our own interests.\u201d Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of environment, climate change and health, added: \u201cIt has never been clearer that the climate crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we all face.\u201d But measures such as bringing down air pollution would reduce the number of global deaths from the problem while dramatically cutting greenhouse gases, and a shift to more nutritious, health-based diets would reduce emissions and avoid up to 5.1 million diet-related deaths a year by 2050, she said.

Decades of monitoring how animals are adapting to global warming has shown that, with  a third of species  possibly facing extinction, many are changing their breeding and migration patterns to avoid the new levels of heat and, in some cases, shrinking to better regulate their body temperatures. In a phenomenon known as Allen\u2019s Rule, animals in warmer climates tend to have larger appendages \u2013 such as ears, beaks, legs and tails \u2013 which they can use to dissipate heat.  While appendages often have fewer feathers or less fur than other parts of birds\u2019 and animals\u2019 bodies, they also have other advantages. For example, elephants can pump warm blood to their ears, which are filled with blood vessels, and flap them to disperse the heat. The larger the appendage, the more heat can be lost. In new research, scientists report finding \u201cwidespread evidence\u201d of changes in appendage size in response to global warming \u2013 \u201cfrom the Arctic to tropical regions of Australia\u201d. Published in the  Trends in Ecology and Evolution  journal, the study saw scientists analyse museum records of animal body proportions and review long-term analyses of wild animals, which revealed numerous instances in which species\u2019 appendages had grown rapidly over a short time. While these instances of rapid \u201cshape-shifting\u201d have often previously been attributed to changes in habitat or diet, climate change is the \u201cone unifying variable\u201d which can explain why the changes are occurring in so many different species across the world, lead author Sara Ryding told  VICE . \u201cA lot of the time when climate change is discussed in mainstream media, people are asking \u2018can humans overcome this\u2019, or \u2018what technology can solve this\u2019,\u201d said Ms Ryding, a PhD student in ornithology at Australia\u2019s Deakin University.  \u201cIt\u2019s high time we recognised that animals also have to adapt to these changes, but this is occurring over a far shorter timescale than would have occurred through most of evolutionary time. The climate change that we have created is heaping a whole lot of pressure on them, and while some species will adapt, others will not.\u201d The increases in appendage size witnessed so far \u201care quite small\u201d at less than 10 per cent and \u201care unlikely to be immediately noticeable\u201d, Ms Ryding said. \u201cHowever, prominent appendages such as ears are predicted to increase \u2013 so we might end up with a live-action Dumbo in the not-so-distant future,\u201d she added. The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent The Independent Most of the examples of shape-shifting the researchers found were in birds. For example, the beaks of two Australian parrots \u2013 gang-gang cockatoos and red-rumped parrots \u2013 have increased in size by between 4 and 10 per cent since since 1871. The changes are already occurring in mammals too. For example, since 1950, masked shrews in Alaska have seen their tails and legs grow significantly since 1950, while great roundleaf bats\u2019 wings have increased in size by 1.64 per cent. The study also posited that increases in extreme weather events \u2013 increasingly  shown to be a result of climate breakdown  \u2013 could be contributing to some species\u2019 rapid shape-shifting. The researchers pointed to the North American dark-eyed junco sparrow, whose bill size appeared to increase in relation to short-term temperature extremes. The scientists hope that their research could help to predict which animals could be most susceptible to rapid appendage growth, and how this could impact their broader ecosystems. \u201cShapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is \u2018fine\u2019,\u201d Ms Ryding said.  \u201cIt just means they are evolving to survive it \u2013 but we\u2019re not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are, or indeed that all species are capable of changing and surviving.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Warmer weather linked to greater numbers of injuries, increased violence and mental health problems Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The ONS findings \u2018show an increase in hospital admissions but a decrease in deaths due to rising average temperatures in the UK \u2019  The first ever Office for National Statistics analysis of climate-related deaths and  hospital admissions  in England and Wales reveal the environment emergency is already adversely affecting health in the UK and is expected to get worse. Warmer winters have resulted in fewer deaths, while hotter summers have seen overall numbers of hospitalisations rise, although the  ONS  said there was relatively little increase in deaths caused directly by warmer  weather.  The analysis noted that average temperatures in the UK have risen over time. The Met Office found that the period 1991 to 2020 was  0.9 degrees Celsius warmer  than the 1961 to 1990 average, while the 10 warmest years on record occurred since 2002. The figures revealed that over the four warmest months of the year, hospital admissions were affected by increasing temperatures, with 16,020 more people admitted in the period 2010 to 2018 than the baseline averages would have suggested. \u201cPrevious research has linked warmer weather to injuries from outdoor activities, increased violence and  mental health problems ; direct harm from extreme heat is still less common but this is likely to change over time,\u201d the service said in a statement. \u201cMore heatwaves and extreme weather events are expected, which is likely to cause greater harm to health,\u201d the statement said. Myer Glickman from the ONS said: \u201cClimate change is the greatest long-term health threat globally and is expected to impact the UK increasingly over the coming years. We need to monitor and report those effects to inform the public and policymakers. \u201cOur findings, looking at changes between 2001 and 2020, show an increase in hospital admissions but a decrease in deaths due to rising average temperatures in the UK \u2013 the latter at least partly because of warmer winters.  \u201cThis is not surprising given our existing cool to temperate climate, but has to be seen in the context of strong evidence that the future effects of climate change will include prolonged heatwaves, flooding and other extreme events with consequent impacts on health.\u201d He added: \u201cIt will be important to develop more sensitive measures of the health impacts of climate change, for example on mental health and chronic diseases.\u201d Responding to the ONS analysis, Paul Redington, a major loss property manager for insurer Zurich, said: \u201cIn the UK, overheating in homes is emerging as a major risk as summer temperatures grow more extreme. In particular, the rush to convert offices left vacant by the pandemic could create swathes of properties vulnerable to climate change. \u201cIn the last quarter alone, the number of conversions approved under relaxed planning rules soared from 296 to 409 \u2013 an increase of 38 per cent. Year-on-year, numbers have surged by 53 per cent. \u201cThere is a danger that poorly designed and hastily built conversions, which lack ventilation and shading, could become unbearably hot as heatwaves become more intense, impacting people\u2019s health. More affordable housing is urgently needed \u2013 but homes must be fit for living now, and for future climate conditions.\u201d The ONS described the statistics in their analysis as \u201cexperimental\u201d, and said they were \u201ca step towards regular, transparent ONS estimates of climate-health impacts which are diagnosis-specific and inform policymakers and the public\u201d.

The  ozone layer , in the upper part of the Earth\u2019s  atmosphere , absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation from the sun that would otherwise be damaging to life on our planet. Concentrations of ozone, also known as trioxygen, fell to \u201cnear zero values\u201d over Antarctica at around 20 - 25km altitude, according to scientists at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams). The large hole comes after an \u201cunusually small and short-lived\u201d ozone hole in 2019, due to particular atmospheric conditions, Cams said, and highlighted the need to enforce bans on human-made chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are known to contribute to ozone depletion. The scientists said this year\u2019s large hole in the layer was being driven by a \u201cstrong, stable and cold  polar vortex \u201d - a persistent region of low pressure, usually found over the edge of the enormous Ross ice shelf, where temperatures can plunge to almost -80C.  \u201cThere is much variability in how far ozone hole events develop each year. The 2020 ozone hole resembles the one from 2018, which also was a quite large hole, and is definitely in the upper part of the pack of the last fifteen years or so\u201d, said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of Cams. \u201cWith the sunlight returning to the South Pole in the last weeks, we saw continued ozone depletion over the area.  \u201cAfter the unusually small and short-lived ozone hole in 2019, which was driven by special meteorological conditions, we are registering a rather large one again this year, which confirms that we need to continue enforcing the Montreal Protocol banning emissions of ozone depleting chemicals.\u201d The scientists explained that the hole in the ozone layer is formed as chlorine and bromine-containing substances accumulate within the freezing polar vortex, where they remain inactive in darkness. But when the sun rises over the pole following the winter darkness, the energy it releases causes the temporarily inert bromine and chlorine atoms to become chemically active, and they rapidly destroy ozone molecules, depleting the layer. At ground level, ozone - a pungent gas which smells similar to chlorine - is considered a pollutant as it is a powerful oxidant, which causes damage to mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and can also impact plants. However, its presence in the stratosphere is beneficial due to its ability to absorb medium-frequency ultraviolet light. The ozone layer absorbs around 97-99 per cent of all UV light, preventing skin cancer and other conditions.

The documentarian, 94, known as the planet\u2019s \u201celder statesman\u201d has become increasingly direct on the perils that humanity faces if we fail to tackle the climate crisis.\u00a0 Sir David shared his views ahead of the release this week of his book and Netflix documentary,  David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet , a personal reflection on what he has witnessed over six decades as a naturalist and broadcaster. While speaking to the  BBC  on Monday, he praised China for moving in the right direction on climate, following Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s recent announcement of an aim for  carbon neutrality  by 2060. However he had sharp words for the United States. \u201cThe present administration in America, from a conservationist\u2019s point of view, is disastrous. But there we are: that\u2019s who\u2019s been elected and we have to go through it,\u201d Sir David said. He told  60 Minutes  on Sunday, that \u201cwe are sunk\u201d if countries cannot put aside national ambitions and tackle climate change with an \"international ambition of survival\u201d.\u00a0 He was asked by host Anderson Cooper what message he would have for President Trump, President Xi or Indian prime minster Narendra Modi. (China, the US and India produce the world\u2019s highest carbon emissions.) \u00a0\u201cI would say that the time has come to put aside national ambitions and look for an international ambition of survival,\u201d Sir David said.\u00a0 Cooper pointed out that nationalist sentiments are rising across many countries, a turn away from the international cooperation of the past. \u201cThat's what's gonna sink us in the end. That's what's gonna sink us,\u201d Sir David said. The veteran broadcaster calls his new film a \u201cwitness statement\u201d. Cooper, remarked that a \u201cwitness statement\u201d is normally given at a crime scene.\u00a0 \u201cWell, a crime has been committed. And it so happens that, I'm of such an age, that I was able to see it beginning,\u201d he replied. The 94-year-old has been making nature documentaries for six decades. His 2017 series,  Blue Planet II , highlighted the threat to the world\u2019s oceans posed by a rise in plastic waste.\u00a0 He was also asked about why he is now more direct about the climate crisis. \"If you\u2019re going \u00a0to make a statement about the world, you better make sure that it isn't just your own personal reaction,' Sir David told  60 Minutes .\u00a0 \u201cAnd the only way you can do that, is to see the work of scientists around the world who are taking observation as to what's happening. As to what's happening to temperature, what's happening to humidity, what's happening to radioactivity, and what's happening ecologically?\u201d He has called climate change \u201cthe greatest threat facing the planet for thousands of years\u201d, and went on to say that \u201ceven the biggest and most awful things that humanity has done\u2026 pale to significance when you think of what could be around the corner, unless we pull ourselves together\u201d. He urged people not to squander the natural world, saying that despite the monumental challenges, that there was no use saying \u201cto hell with it\".\u00a0 \u00a0Sir David told CBS that he has huge faith in young people to force change, noting that \u201cobviously my generation failed.

Scientists analysed data from nearly two million US residents who reported the state of their mental health for 30 days with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention between 2002 and 2012, coupling this with climate data. On average, months with temperatures above 30C or more than 25 days of rainfall saw increased reports of stress, depression and \u201cproblems with emotions\u201d, scientists said in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Nick Obradovich, the study\u2019s co-author and Massachusetts Institute of Technology research scientist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to consider this as yet another piece in the puzzle of understanding how climate change will influence society, and the conclusion here is that it\u2019s not likely to be good.\u201d The sheer scale of the study adds important weight to the growing body of evidence that shows exposure to climate change-related heat worsens mental health and increases suicide rates. Alarmingly, Dr Obradovich\u2019s team also found that women and those on low incomes were 60 per cent more likely to report mental health problems as a result of weather than the highest earners. The study also noted a 4 per cent rise in reports of poor mental health linked to  Hurricane Katrina , which struck the US Gulf Coast in August 2005 and affected millions of people.

However, there\u2019s a lot of other ways it could be happening.\u201d He believed other possible factors could include the negative effects of heat upon an individual\u2019s productivity and cognitive function, or its impact upon the brain\u2019s ability to regulate emotion. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure and a big part of the work that we as climate change social scientists and impact scientists have to do is figure out what is driving the effects \u2013 largely because if you\u2019re a policymaker you want to know what you should target to reduce these effects,\u201d he said. Dr Obradovich also pointed out the study did not take into account the impact that the existential risk of climate change could be having upon our collective mental health, or harder to quantify symptoms of climate change such as rising sea levels. He called for all countries to improve their mental healthcare services so if people \u201cface stressors that are produced by climate change, they may have a better baseline level of mental healthcare and availability\u201d. However, the study stated that the correlation between rising heat levels and worsened mental health \u201cmay not persist into the future\u201d, as humans could find a way to adapt either technologically or physiologically to the effects observed. On the day of the study\u2019s publication, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned there are only 12 years left to limit global temperature increases to below 1.5C. The UN report argued urgent and unprecedented policy changes are necessary to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

Amid rapid  global warming  \u2013 with average Arctic temperatures already 2C above what they were in the pre-industrial era \u2013 the extent of the  sea ice  is diminishing ever faster. As the  climate crisis  worsens, scientists say it is now only the efficacy of protection measures which will determine for how many more years our planet will continue to have a northern ice cap year round. A major new piece of research involving 21 leading institutes and using 40 different climate models has found that whatever action is taken, we are on course to see ice-free summers in the coming decades. The research is  published in the journal  Geophysical Research Letters . The scientists considered the future of Arctic sea-ice cover in scenarios with high future CO2  emissions  and little climate protection \u2013 as expected, Arctic sea ice disappeared quickly in summer in these simulations.  But the study also found the Arctic summer sea ice also disappears \u201coccasionally\u201d if CO2 emissions are rapidly reduced. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Dirk Notz, who leads the sea-ice research group at University of Hamburg, said: \u201cIf we reduce global emissions rapidly and substantially, and thus keep global warming below 2C relative to preindustrial levels, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.\u201d  Currently, the North Pole is covered by sea ice year round. Each summer, the area of the sea ice cover decreases, in winter it grows again.  In response to ongoing global warming, the overall area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice has rapidly been reduced over the past few decades.  This substantially affects the Arctic ecosystem and climate. The sea-ice cover is a hunting ground and habitat for polar bears and seals, and keeps the Arctic cool by reflecting sunlight. How often the Arctic will lose its sea-ice cover in the future critically depends on future CO2 emissions, the authors said.  If emissions are reduced rapidly, ice-free years will only occur occasionally. With higher emissions, the Arctic Ocean will become ice free most years.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile When it comes to measuring global warming, humidity, not just heat, matters in generating dangerous climate extremes, a new study finds. Researchers say temperature by itself isn\u2019t the best way to measure climate change's weird weather and downplays impacts in the tropics. But factoring in air moisture along with heat shows that climate change since 1980 is nearly twice as bad as previously calculated, according to their study in Monday\u2019s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The energy generated in extreme weather, such as storms, floods and rainfall is related to the amount of water in the air. So a team of scientists in the U.S. and  China  decided to use an obscure weather measurement called equivalent potential temperature \u2014 or theta-e \u2014 that reflects \u201cthe moisture energy of the atmosphere,\u201d said study co-author V. \u201cRam\u201d Ramanathan, a climate scientist at the University of California San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and  Cornell University  It\u2019s expressed in degrees, like temperature. \u201cThere are two drivers of climate change: temperature and humidity,\u201d Ramanathan said. \u201cAnd so far we measured global warming just in terms of temperature.\u201d But by adding the energy from humidity, \u201cthe extremes \u2014 heat waves, rainfall and other measures of extremes \u2014 correlate much better,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because as the world warms, the air holds more moisture, nearly 4% for every degree Fahrenheit (7% for every degree Celsius). When that moisture condenses, it releases heat or energy, \u201cthat\u2019s why when it rains, now it pours,\u201d Ramanathan said. In addition, water vapor is a potent heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere that increases climate change, he said. From 1980 to 2019, the world warmed about 1.42 degrees (0.79 degrees Celsius). But taking energy from humidity into account, the world has warmed and moistened 2.66 degrees (1.48 degrees Celsius), the study said. And in the tropics, the warming was as much as 7.2 degrees (4 degrees Celsius). When judging by temperature alone, it looks like warming is most pronounced in North America, mid-latitudes and especially the poles \u2014 and less so in the tropics, Ramanathan said.  But that\u2019s not the case, he said, because the high humidity in the tropics juices up storm activity, from regular storms to tropical cyclones and monsoons. \u201cThis increase in latent energy is released in the air which leads to weather extremes: floods, storms and droughts,\u201d Ramanathan said. University of Illinois  climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said it makes sense because water vapor is key in extreme rainfall. \u201cBoth heat and humidity are important,\u201d Wuebbles said. Environmental scientist Katharine Mach of the  University of Miami  who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said \u201chumidity is key in shaping the impacts of heat on human health and well-being, at present and into the future.\u201d ___ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http:\/\/www.apnews.com\/Climate ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on  Twitter  at @borenbears Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Impact of droughts and heatwaves stronger in recent decades, especially in developed countries Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Droughts and heatwaves have reduced cereal harvests by an average of about 10 per cent globally over the past half century, and their impact has become stronger in recent decades especially in developed countries, a study has found. Climate change is expected to increase the risk of severe drought and extreme heat and now the first detailed analysis of global cereal production has shown that harvests of wheat, maize and rice have suffered greater losses since the 1980s from drought and heat compared to previous decades. The findings question whether increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are having a discernible \u201cfertilising effect\u201d on crop production that could outweigh the damaging effect on harvests caused by extreme weather events such as droughts and heatwaves exacerbated by global warming. An analysis of national production of 16 different cereal crops in 177 countries, and a comparison with the effects of about 2,800 weather disasters between 1964 and 2007, has for the first time provided a detailed snapshot of how extreme weather has affected overall cereal production globally, scientists said. The study found that drought and heatwaves reduced cereal harvests by between 9 per cent and 10 per cent on average in the affected countries. However, the technically advanced arable farms of North America, Europe and Australia were even more strongly affected than the developing world, with average production cuts of about 20 per cent. \u201cWe found that extreme weather disasters such as droughts and heatwaves substantially reduce crop production, and the impacts are worse in richer countries,\u201d said Pedram Rowhani of Sussex University and a co-author of the study.  \u201cThe frequency and severity of these extreme weather events is expected to increase in the future. If we do not adapt our agricultural systems to become more resilient to these shocks we can anticipate even larger losses in the future,\u201d Dr Rowhani said. The analysis, published in the journal Nature, found that losses in average cereal producton caused by more recent droughts had increased in more recent years, with average reductions of about 13.7 per cent compared to losses of about 6.7 per cent prior to the mid-1980s. However, the analysis also showed that cereal production soon bounced back after a drought year. Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty EPA Getty Getty \u201cWe have always known that extreme weather causes crop production losses. But until now we did not know exactly how much global production was lost to such extreme weather events, and how they varied by different regions of the world,\u201d said Navin Ramankutty, professor of global food security and sustainability at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and senior author. One of the most suprising findings was that advanced countries were apparently more susceptible to crop losses due to droughts and heatwaves compared to less advanced nations. This may reflect differences in scale and the farming methods employed in growing and harvesting cereals, the scientists said. \u201cAcross the breadbaskets of North America, for example, the crops and methods of farming are very uniform across huge areas, so if a drought hits in a way that is damaging to those crops, they will all suffer,\u201d said Corey Lesk of McGill University in Montreal, the study\u2019s first author. \u201cBy contrast, in much of the developing world, the cropping systems are a patchwork of small fields with diverse crops. If a drought hits, some of those crops may be damaged, but others may survive,\u201d Mr Lesk said. Farmers in wealthier countries rarely depend on harvests directly for food, and typically have dependable access to crop insurance in the event of bad weather, he said.  \u201cSo the optimal strategy for them may be to maximize yields rather than minimize the risk of weather-related crop damage.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

In the UK, the shutdown has already seen  a huge leap  in  air quality  with measurements of toxic small particulate matter down by as much as 50 per cent in some major cities. Similar effects have been recorded across the world as industry has paused while governments grapple with the  pandemic . Amid the devastation caused by the virus, the shutdown has been credited with giving hope of how a low-carbon economy may be achieved. Covid-19  has claimed over 25,000 lives, and already caused unprecedented economic shock across the world, which is expected to lead to mass unemployment. As leaders plan stimulus packages to bail out their economies, experts have warned against a rapid return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d replete with the huge inequalities, and environmental degradation which have characterised larger economies, particularly as the world is currently on track to miss emissions targets with the impacts being \u201ctoo catastrophic to comprehend\u201d. Speaking at an online panel discussion hosted by climate litigation charity  Plan B , professor of epidemiology and public health at  UCL  and chair of the  WHO \u2019s Commission on Social Determinants of Health, Sir Michael Marmot, said: \u201cWhat the Covid crisis exposes is that we can do things differently. We must not go back to the status quo, we cannot do that.\u201d  \u201cWhat I would like to see, and we are seeing it at some regional levels within the UK, as well as some other countries, is putting the likely impact on health equity at the heart of all policymaking. That would lead to better environmental policy, it would lead to better social policy, it would lead to better healthcare policy and better political policies.\u201d His sentiment was echoed by co-founder of  Extinction Rebellion , Dr Gail Bradbrook, who said there will be \u201ca reckoning to come\u201d about the inadequacy of responses to the coronavirus outbreak for both national governments and for the lack of international cooperation, and said this has also been a problem within the climate and ecological crisis.  She said: \u201cThings that needed to have been done but weren\u2019t to prevent the pandemic, are similar to the things needed to address the climate and ecological crisis.  \u201cThe word people have used is \u2018impossible\u2019, we cannot conceive of making the changes, well now it\u2019s been forced on us \u2013 what once was impossible is now happening.\u201d Speaking about Extinction Rebellion urging governments to aim for net zero emissions by 2025, Dr Bradbrook added: \u201cWe were told this was an \u201cimpossible target\u201d, but the things happening right now are the things needed to hit a 2025 target. We can do the impossible. We have to.\u201d The panel agreed \u201cthe climate emergency is much more serious than people think,\u201d as it was put by former special representative for climate change and chief scientific advisor to the government, Sir David King. He said: \u201c Pollution  is accountable for around 7 million deaths globally and if we take action on climate change we will be taking action on the environment and pollution.\u201d Further stark impacts of failure to rein in emissions were described by Dr Jason Hickel, lecturer in economic anthropology at Goldsmiths University, who said: \u201cMost of us are more aware of the biophysical consequences of climate change than we are of some of the social consequences of it. Food supply is one of the greater risks we have to consider.  \u201cFor every degree we heat the planet the average crop yield around the world declines by about 10 per cent. At the end of the century if we have 3 or 4 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, it will collapse the average crop yields by up to 40 per cent.\u201d \u201cWe have to understand what the implications of this will be. Already we\u2019re seeing people moving out of their homes seeking more arable, habitable parts of the planet. I think we can expect a significant upsurge of this kind of migration as people quite rightly seek access to more habitable parts of the planet.  \u201cAnd that could fundamentally destabilise the world system, which is already starting to buckle under this pressure.\u201d He added: \u201cFascist movements are on the march in Europe, the EU is in the process of slow-motion disintegration, it\u2019s difficult to imagine it much worse, but we have to be prepared for that and take it very seriously. \u201cHeating beyond 1.5 \u2013 2 degrees leads to scenarios in terms of food supply that are too catastrophic to comprehend. We need rapid, very urgent reductions in emissions.\u201d Professor Sam Fankhauser, co-director of the Grantham Research Institute and former deputy chief economist at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, said the Covid-19 crisis presented an opportunity to build a greener economy. He said: \u201cAs we move into rebuilding the economy we can pay attention to the carbon intensity of the stimulus packages. \u201cThere are a lot of things that need to happen in a zero carbon economy that are consistent with a rapid boost to the economy.  \u201cThe three tests which economists use for a good stimulus is they have to be timely, targeted and temporary and there are a lot of climate change measures which fall into that category. So we can have a low-carbon recovery, that\u2019s absolutely possible.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Climate scientists at the  University of Michigan  looked at 15 different plant pollens in the  United States  and used computer simulations to calculate how much worse allergy season will likely get by the year 2100. It\u2019s enough to make allergy sufferers even more red-eyed. As the world warms, allergy season will start weeks earlier and end many days later \u2014 and it'll be worse while it lasts, with pollen levels that could as much as triple in some places, according to a new study Tuesday in the journal  Nature Communications. Warmer weather allows plants to start blooming earlier and keeps them blooming later. Meanwhile, additional carbon dioxide in the air from burning fuels such as coal, gasoline and natural gas helps plants produce more pollen, said study co-author Allison Steiner, a University of Michigan climate scientist. It's already happening. A study a year ago from different researchers found that from 1990 to 2018, pollen has increased and allergy season is starting earlier, with much of it because of climate change.  Allergists say that pollen season in the US used to start around St. Patrick\u2019s Day and now often starts around Valentine\u2019s Day. The new study found that allergy season would stretch even longer and the total amount of pollen would skyrocket. How long and how much depends on the particular pollen, the location and how much greenhouse gas emissions are put in the air. With moderate cuts in greenhouse gas emission from coal, oil and natural gas, pollen season would start 20 days earlier by the end of the century. In the most extreme and increasingly unlikely warming scenario, pollen season in much of America will start 40 days earlier than when it has generally started in recent decades.  Already about 30 per cent of the world and 40 per cent of American children suffer pollen allergies, which hurt the economy through lost work days and medical costs, said University of Michigan climate researcher Yingxiao Zhang, lead author of the new study.  Allergies  are especially difficult for the 25 million Americans with asthma. This could make the problem much worse for them, said Amir Sapkota, a University of Maryland environmental health professor, who wasn't part of the research. While allergy suffering will increase across the United States, the Southeast will get hit hardest, said Steiner.  The start of alder tree pollen season will move most dramatically, an issue in the Pacific Northwest. Cypress tree pollen \u2014 which is especially bad in Texas \u2014 will see among the biggest increases.  Ragweed and grasses \u2014 common pollen allergies \u2014 will also have longer seasons and higher pollen counts in the future, Zhang said.  The University of Michigan team\u2019s projections projects would be about twice as large a jump in pollen problems as has happened since 1990, said  University of Utah  biologist and climate scientist Bill Anderegg.  \u201cOverall, this is an incredibly important study,\u201d said Anderegg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research. \u201cIt tells us that the historical trends of longer and more severe pollen seasons are likely to continue, driven by climate change, and this will absolutely have substantial health consequences in allergies and asthma for Americans.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Huge loss of animals and plants imminent as climate crisis continues, say researchers Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile In just 50 years\u2019 time, a third of all plant and animal species on our planet could be wiped out due to man-made  climate change , US scientists have warned. The damning new study of humanity\u2019s impact on ecosystems around the world examined recent extinctions due to climate change, along with rates of species movement and various projections of future climatic conditions. The researchers said their study is probably the first to estimate broad-scale extinction patterns due to the  climate crisis  by using data from recent climate-related extinctions and from rates of species movements. It is the latest research to paint a bleak picture of future biodiversity on Earth, as other scientists  have warned  our species is responsible for bringing about a  sixth mass extinction  event. The research team, from the  University of Arizona  used data from 538 species at 581 sites around the globe and focused on species which had been studied at the same place at least 10 years apart. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty They found 44 per cent of the 538 species had already gone extinct at one or more of the sites they had earlier inhabited. They also generated climate data through measurements taken at the time of the earliest survey of each site and at more recent surveys. \u201cBy analysing the change in 19 climatic variables at each site, we could determine which variables drive local extinctions and how much change a population can tolerate without going extinct,\u201d said Cristian Rom\u00e1n-Palacios of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. \u201cWe also estimated how quickly populations can move to try and escape rising temperatures.  \u201cWhen we put all of these pieces of information together for each species, we can come up with detailed estimates of global extinction rates for hundreds of plant and animal species.\u201d The study identified maximum annual temperatures \u2013 the hottest daily highs in summer \u2013 as the key variable that best explains whether a population will become extinct.  But the researchers found average yearly temperatures showed smaller changes at sites with local extinction, even though average temperatures are widely used as a proxy for overall climate change. \u201cThis means that using changes in mean annual temperatures to predict extinction from climate change might be positively misleading,\u201d said Professor John Wiens, also of the University of Arizona. The researchers said previous studies have focused on species dispersal \u2013 or migration to cooler habitats \u2013 as a means for  animals  and  plants  to \u201cescape\u201d from warming climates.  But the new research indicates most species will not be able to disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction, based on their past rates of movement.  Instead, they found many species were able to tolerate some increases in maximum temperatures, but only up to a point.  About 50 per cent of the species had local extinctions if maximum temperatures increased by more than 0.5C, and 95 per cent if temperatures increase by more than 2.9C. Projections of species loss depend on just how much warmer the local climate will become in the future. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019,\u201d Professor Wiens said. \u201cIf we stick to the  Paris Agreement  to combat climate change, we may lose fewer than two out of every 10 plant and animal species on Earth by 2070.  \u201cBut if humans cause larger temperature increases, we could lose more than a third or even half of all animal and plant species, based on our results.\u201d The paper\u2019s projections of species loss are similar for plants and animals, but extinctions are projected to be two to four times more common in the tropics than in temperate regions. \u201cThis is a big problem, because the majority of plant and animal species occur in the tropics,\u201d Mr Rom\u00e1n-Palacios said.

According to climate scientists, that\u2019s how long until we hit the 1.5C tipping point  if we carry on as we are . Such a shift in our planetary temperature will imperil not only low-lying areas because of the increased risk of floods, but will have consequences for all of us \u2013 not least due to the necessary migration of millions of people away from areas that become uninhabitable. Coral reefs will vanish; many ancient trees will not survive; extreme weather events will become ever more common. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  paints a bleak picture . Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Yet the scientists are also clear that we can still hold the line on further damaging change \u2013 if we\u2019re prepared to act fast and invest a great deal of money. By reducing CO2 emissions by nearly half from their 2010 levels, we could give ourselves a fighting chance; by planting millions of trees and using technology to further capture carbon dioxide too, we might just do it. But in all honesty it is hard to feel optimistic about the world\u2019s ability to make that happen. The World Wildlife Fund\u2019s lead climate change scientist, Chris Weber, says \u201cthe difference between possibility and impossibility is  political will \u201d, which in present circumstances is unnerving, to say the least. For one thing, the world\u2019s most powerful politician is arguably its  most famous climate change sceptic . According to Donald Trump, \u201cthe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive\u201d. Sure enough, he backed up such Twitter trash-talk by pulling America out of the Paris climate agreement soon after taking up residence in the White House. Meanwhile, in China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter by a distance \u2013 the amount of carbon being thrown into the atmosphere is increasing: emissions rose by 4 per cent in the first three months of 2018. As it goes, the Chinese have  invested significantly in renewables , yet the growing prosperity of its vast population continues to increase demand for energy to such an extent that curbing carbon output is challenging, to say the least. India\u2019s CO2 emissions are also soaring \u2013 albeit from a much lower base, which means there is a glimmer of hope on the subcontinent for a greener future. Even at the individual level, though \u2013 and even among those who accept that climate change is a real and present danger \u2013 is there really the will to change our ways for good? We might be more likely to consider a car\u2019s carbon emissions when we choose a new motor; but are we really much less inclined to drive the short distance to the shops when there\u2019s a bit of rain in the air? Likewise, we might be shocked when we see a show on TV like last week\u2019s  Drowning in Plastic  \u2013 which revealed the amount of  plastic being swallowed by seabirds , among other horrors \u2013 but can we maintain the hastily made resolution never again to buy plastic tat for the kids when they\u2019re whining their way round the supermarket? Those who deny climate change remain peculiarly certain that all will be well. And in light of Trump\u2019s attitude, China\u2019s demographic reality, as well as our own human weakness, there is a temptation to throw up our hands and give it all up to fate. But of course we mustn\u2019t. After all, even if there was a modest chance that the vast majority of climate scientists and policymakers were right in their conclusions about the way we are changing our planet \u2013 and about the likely consequences \u2013 then it would seem sensible to act in a way that might reduce the level of harm we are doing to the planet (frankly, it would seem bonkers to do otherwise). That means making myriad small changes to our lives; and it means pressuring politicians to pursue green policies. We may not be able to hold back the tide \u2013 and at present the outlook looks pretty bleak: but for goodness sake let\u2019s at least try.

The more money people have, the greater their  energy  footprint, the study found - a trend which the authors said was replicated across the world.  Researchers from the  University of Leeds  said that, among all 86 countries and income classes studied, the top 10 per cent consumed about 20 times more energy than the bottom 10 per cent.  \u201cOur results consequently expose large inequality in international energy footprints,\u201d the authors concluded.  The study looked at energy consumption through the lens of energy directly used, as well as the amount \u201cused to manufacture and transport traded products\u201d, according to Julia Steinberger, one of the researchers.  Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty She said their work found that \u201cricher households, around the world, tend to spend their extra [money] on energy intensive products\u201d, such as package holidays and fuel for their cars.  Spending on transport \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 was one of the most important factors in this difference, the professor at the School of Earth and Environment said.  The top 10 per cent of consumers used more than half of the total energy related to travel, with the majority of it based on fossil fuel, found the research - published in scientific journal  Nature Energy .  \u201cWithout reducing the energy demand of these services, either through frequent-flyer levies, promoting public transport and limiting private vehicle use, or alternative technology such as electric vehicles,\u201d lead author Yannick Oswald said, \u201dthe study suggests that as incomes and wealth improve, our fossil fuel consumption in transport will skyrocket.\u201d The researchers found that energy used for cooking and heating was consumed in a more equal manner across income groups.  The  study  also found that energy consumption was distributed unequally across countries.  Twenty per cent of UK citizens belonged to the top 5 per cent of energy consumers across the world, compared to 100 per cent of  Luxembourg\u2019 s and 2 per cent of  China \u2018s populations.  Meanwhile, the poorest 20 per cent of the UK used up more than five times the amount of energy than 84 per cent of  India , according to a University of Leeds  statement  about the work.  \u201cThere needs to be serious consideration to how to change the vastly unequal distribution of global energy consumption,\u201d Professor Steinberger said, \u201dto cope with the dilemma of providing a decent life for everyone while protecting climate and ecosystems.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Kallan had heard about  climate change  (her mother is an environmental scientist), but she didn\u2019t know world leaders had just signed an agreement calling it \u201cone of the greatest challenges of our time.\u201d She cared about Earth, but she trusted adults to protect it. She doesn\u2019t feel that way anymore. By the final year of the decade, the planet had surpassed its 2010 temperature record five times. Hurricanes devastated New Jersey and Puerto Rico and floods destroyed the Midwest and Bangladesh. Southern Africa was gripped by a deadly drought.  Australia  and the  Amazon  are ablaze. Global emissions are expected to hit an all-time high this year, and humanity is on track to cross the threshold for tolerable warming within a generation. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty The 2010s were a \u201cdecade of disappointment,\u201d said Kallan, now 15 and a national coordinator for the youth climate organisation  Fridays for Future . If the world is to stave off further disasters, the next decade must be one of unprecedented climate action, she said. \u201cThis decade that we\u2019re going into now will be the most important of our lives,\u201d Kallan said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of running out of options. And we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d Ten years ago, the United Nations released its first \u201cemissions gap\u201d report detailing the disparity between commitments made by nations to reduce greenhouse gases and what is needed to meet global temperature targets. It estimated that countries should be curbing emissions by about 3 per cent per year. But that hasn\u2019t happened, said Surabi Menon, vice president for global intelligence at the ClimateWorks Foundation and a steering committee member for the UN\u2019s emissions gap reports. \u201cWe\u2019ve left ourselves with a very narrow window to take the kind of action that needs to be taken,\u201d she said. The 2015 Paris Climate Accord \u2013 the first-ever global agreement to limit warming to \u201cwell below 2C\u201d \u2013 was important, Ms Menon said. But the promises made at that meeting fell short. According to the latest emissions gap report, temperatures can be expected to rise 3.2C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, unless the world\u2019s top emitters increase their Paris commitments. Right now, most are not on track to meet even their most modest targets. The world is already about 1C warmer than it was before humans started burning fossil fuels. Global annual emissions have increased 4 per cent since the Paris agreement was signed. And the average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2013 \u201cthe only number that matters,\u201d in the words of Phil DeCola, chief scientist for the World Meteorological Organisation\u2019s greenhouse gas monitoring program \u2013 is the highest in human history. Meanwhile, improved scientific models found that even 2 degrees of warming \u2013 once thought to be a reasonable target \u2013 could be practically intolerable in parts of the world. To get on track to achieve a less disastrous 1.5 degrees temperature rise, a  landmark UN report  found nations must nearly halve emissions by 2030. The UN\u2019s  1.5 degree analysis  provoked widespread alarm after it was published in 2018. Politicians referred to the report at rallies, teenagers quoted it during school walkouts. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something by then,\u201d 14-year-old climate activist Alexandria Villasenor said in February, referring to 2030, \u201cit will be the end of my world.\u201d But climate scientists caution against treating 2030 as a deadline, and 1.5 degrees as a threshold for extinction. \u201cClimate change is not a cliff, it\u2019s not a pass-fail course,\u201d said Georgia Tech researcher Kim Cobb. \u201cIf we meet the 1.5 target, there may still be tons of ugly surprises. And if we don\u2019t meet it, it\u2019s not that everybody\u2019s going to die.\u201d According to Ms Cobb, the report is better understood as a road map for navigating the perilous path to sustainability. \u201cOur decisions over the next 10 years will affect the magnitude of climate change for centuries to come,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can get more sobering than that.\u201d The first and most important step will be to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, experts say. According to the latest emissions gap analysis, the past 10 years of inaction have more than doubled the rate at which emissions must fall; to meet the 1.5 degree goal, emissions must be cut by 7.6 per cent each year. Such action would require \u201cunprecedented transformation of society,\u201d the report acknowledged. But many of the solutions needed \u2013 both economic and technological \u2013 already exist. The report called on the global community to replace coal power with renewable energy, decarbonise transportation and manufacturing, and help developing nations build green infrastructure to meet their growing power needs. Ending subsidies for fossil fuels could reduce global emissions 10 per cent by 2030, the UN has found. And eliminating \u201cshort-lived\u201d greenhouse gases \u2013 including methane, black carbon and fluorinated gases, which linger in the atmosphere less than carbon dioxide but trap more heat \u2013 over the next 20 years could help Earth avoid between 0.6 and 0.8 degrees of warming by 2050, research suggests. Ms Menon draws hope from progress that\u2019s been made on the ground in the past decade, even as global leaders fell short. Global renewable energy capacity has quadrupled since 2010, largely thanks to improved technology and falling costs, she noted. People increasingly see climate change as a threat; a  Washington Post  poll this year found 76 per cent of American adults view the issue as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d or a \u201ccrisis.\u201d This year\u2019s global climate strikes, led by teenagers such as Kallan and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, were among the largest environmental protests in history.

Natural systems currently absorb more than half the carbon people produce, and a 2018 study found that conservation, restoration and improved land management practices could reduce the United States\u2019 net emissions by as much as 21 per cent. But cutting down forests, dredging wetlands and polluting the coasts reduces that capacity. \u201cIf we don\u2019t actually reverse the rise of carbon dioxide, so that we are lowering the concentrations in the atmosphere, it\u2019s just going to go on getting worse and worse,\u201d Mr Moomaw said. In the bleak report released this August, the UN forecast the consequences of inaction on land. Warming beyond 1.5 degrees will lead to high risk of drought, wildfires, destructive hurricanes and outbreaks of agricultural pests, scientists said. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could lower the nutritional quality of crops and raise grain prices. Millions will be at risk of losing their homes, livelihoods and lives to natural disasters, and countries will be destabilised by mass migrations. Many parts of the world are already experiencing this extreme change; a  Washington Post  analysis this year found roughly 10 per cent of the globe has surpassed 2 degrees of warming since the pre-industrial era. \u201cThe stakes are high. The climate impacts are severe. And people almost everywhere in the world are experiencing that and waking up,\u201d Ms Menon said. \u201cThat gives me hope.\u201d It is when she considers the political decisions needed to fight warming that she feels pessimistic. At the recent  COP 25  climate talks in Madrid, the world\u2019s leading emitters, including the US and China, did not increase their commitments to cut  emissions . Officials deferred until next year the task of establishing a global carbon trading system. \u201cIt felt like betrayal,\u201d said Kallan, the 15-year-old activist, who lives in Annapolis, Maryland. \u201cBut for me, it means that I have to keep doing what I\u2019m doing. Keep soldiering on.\u201d On a chilly December Friday, shivering through her weekly climate strike at the US Capitol, the teenager tried to imagine what the next 10 years might look like. But the normal life milestones \u2013 dates and dances, college, a job \u2013 were hard to picture. Until the global climate outlook changes, Kallan can\u2019t envision doing anything but activism. It all depends on what happens to the planet. And that depends on what people decide to do. Finally, Kallan sighed. \u201cI really can\u2019t predict the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many ways this decade could go.\u201d  The Washington Post Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A U.N.-backed panel will release a highly anticipated scientific report Monday on international efforts to curb climate change before global temperatures reach dangerous levels. Reports by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  are considered the most authoritative assessments of the state of global warming, its impacts and the measures being taken to tackle it. Negotiations between governments and scientists to finalize the summary for policymakers dragged on past the original deadline until late Sunday, pushing back the planned publication by several hours. Governments agreed in the 2015  Paris  accord to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century. But with temperatures already more than 1.1C higher than the pre-industrial baseline, many experts say that\u2019s only possible with drastic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. The cut-off point for data in the report was last fall, meaning that the impact of the war in  Ukraine  wasn't included by the authors. Rouven Stubbe, an analyst at the consultancy  Berlin  Economics who wasn't involved in the report, said there is a risk that the geopolitical and economic turmoil caused by the conflict could disrupt efforts to reduce emissions. \u201cI think the difficult thing will be that politically we have to maintain course,\" he said. \u201cEspecially now with this high energy prices, there are already voices that say we should ease the (European) emissions trade system\u201d that encourages companies to avoid heavily polluting forms of energy. ___ Follow  AP 's climate coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/climate ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

A  GCSE  study aide on the educational website  features a bullet-pointed list  of \u201cpositive and negative impacts of climate change\u201d. Among the points put forward as positive are \u201cwarmer temperatures and increased CO2 levels, leading to more vigorous plant growth,\u201d and \u201cmore resources, such as oil, becoming available in places such as Alaska and Siberia when the ice melts\u201d. The study resource also suggested that \u201cfrozen regions, such as Canada\u201d would be more able to grow crops thanks to global warming. Critics drew attention to the page as unprecedented and deadly heatwave in Canada fuels raging wildfires. The study resource says that evidence has shown the Earth\u2019s temperature is rising because of an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will \u201ccontinue to create a number of positive and negative effects\u201d. While 10 \u201cnegative\u201d impacts are listed first, including rising sea levels, desertification and flooding, species extinction, frequent extreme weather events and climate migration, the page then goes on to list 10 \u201cpositive\u201d effects. Other so-called positive impacts include new shipping routes becoming available and new tourist destinations opening up. Critics said the exam guidance promoted false balance on climate issues. The environmental writer George Monbiot tweeted: \u201cThis is what BBC bitesize is teaching our children about climate breakdown. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s an absolute disgrace. You could come away thinking: \u2018on balance, it sounds pretty good.\u2019 It could have been written by Exxon\u201d. The BBC said it had reviewed the content on the page in response to criticism and would make amendments.  The list goes on to cite positive and negative aspects of climate change for the UK. The 10 negative elements include the loss of valuable farmland to rising sea levels and flooding, increased incidence of flooding and droughts, increased demand for water supplies, the extinction of certain plant species in Scotland, and the closure of Scottish ski resorts due to a lack of snow. A list of seven \u201cpositive\u201d impacts in the UK includes a longer crop growing season due to higher year-round temperatures, reduced winter heating costs, and growth in the UK tourist industry.

A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe have reviewed the page and are amending the content to be in line with current curricula.\u201d Bitesize is a free only study guide for school-age pupils across the UK, intended to help students in their day-to-day school work and exams. The programming across the online platform was expanded during lockdown to ensure that parents and children had access to resources to keep them on track and learning. In 2018 the BBC officially took a stand on the  climate crisis , stating that \u201cman-made climate change exists\u201d and warned journalists to be aware of \u201cfalse balance\u201d. A related policy document stated: \u201cAs climate change is accepted as happening, you do not need a \u2018denier\u2019 to balance the debate.\u201d It came after the broadcaster was repeatedly criticised for inviting climate change deniers to be interviewed about environmental issues.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile A new UN science report is set to send what may be the starkest warning yet about the impacts of climate change on people and the planet. The assessment is the second in a series of three reports from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) in the latest review of climate science, which take place every six or seven years for governments. It is being published on Monday, a little over 100 days after the  Cop26  summit agreed to increase action to try and limit global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The outcomes of the UN talks in  Glasgow  were described as keeping the temperature goal alive, but only with a weak pulse, by conference president Alok Sharma. The first in the series of reports was described as a \u201ccode red for humanity\u201d by UN secretary-general  Antonio Guterres  when it was released last summer before Cop26 setting out the unequivocal and unprecedented impact humans were having on the planet. It is clear we are now in the climate crisis, not waiting for it The latest assessment, which looks at the impacts of climate change, efforts to adapt to rising temperatures and vulnerabilities is expected to be even more worrying. A draft leaked last year warned of the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds or\u00a0\u201ctipping points\u201d, where things such as melting of ice sheets or permafrost, or rainforests becoming grassland, become irreversible, with huge consequences. The final version of the study will be released after its summary was approved line-by-line in a process involving representatives of governments and scientists over the past two weeks, but which overran by a day as delegates continued to haggle over the text. What it does mean is that\u00a0governments have signed off on the findings of the final version. The report will set out the impacts of rising temperatures, which have already reached 1.1C (1.98F) above pre-industrial levels, from droughts to floods, storms, effects on health, agriculture and cities, and cascading and irreversible impacts. There will be a specific focus on the different regions of the world, as well as looking at vulnerable populations and communities, migration and displacement. It will detail options for \u2013 and limits to \u2013 adapting to climate change. Ahead of the report\u2019s publication, Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors taking action on climate change, warned the latest report was likely to \u201cpaint a grim vision\u201d for big cities from London to Lima. \u201cCity residents are already on the front line of a worsening vulnerability to climate impacts such as deadly flooding, sea-level rise, wild fires, extreme storms and unbearable urban heat. \u201cIt is clear we are now in the climate crisis, not waiting for it.\u00a0We can still overcome climate breakdown and build a thriving future, but urban adaptation efforts must outpace this new climate reality.\u201d He said national leaders must work with mayors to invest in cities\u2019 defences and richer countries must deliver on finance commitments to poorer nations to ensure no city is left behind. Former UK chief scientist Sir  David King , who founded the Climate Crisis Advisory Group of independent experts, warned that because of the way the IPCC reports worked, they did not include the most up-to-date studies or evidence, such as heatwaves in Canada and floods in Europe last year. He said the importance of the reports could not be overrated, telling the PA news agency: \u201cThis crisis is such that it demands a global response. \u201cWhereas the Covid-19 outbreak has been cataclysmic for the world, nevertheless we do recover from these as we know from the past, even before we had vaccines, we had plagues and we recovered from them as a humanity. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no guarantee that we will recover from the impacts of climate change, unless we all begin to work together and far more quickly, far more effectively, than we are doing at the moment. \u201cThere\u2019s a real cause to say the climate crisis is with us and we all have to work together and deal with it in an equitable way.\u201d He warned: \u201cEach individual nation is run by governments that are working for their own communities and that kind of selfishness doesn\u2019t fit this challenge. \u201cWe all have to understand this is a joint challenge \u2013 and I think we\u2019re quite a bit removed from that as we stand now.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

There is a 90 per cent chance that the world's temperature will rise 2C, to 4.9C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, despite measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It's at that point that scientists think the world will fall into disastrous effects like widespread drought, extreme weather and dangerous increases in sea level. Experts have suggested that 2C of warming is the \"tipping point\" at which that change becomes unstoppable. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan The world will almost certainly fail to keep warming to the 1.5C target that was set as part of the Paris climate agreement, according to the same research. There's a 99 per cent chance that climate change will break through that limit. Dr Dargan Frierson, from the University of Washington, said: \"Countries argued for the 1.5C target because of the severe impacts on their livelihoods that would result from exceeding that threshold. Indeed, damages from heat extremes, drought, extreme weather and sea level rise will be much more severe if 2C or higher temperature rise is allowed. \"Our results show that an abrupt change of course is needed to achieve these goals.\" The scientists looked at 50 years of data on world population and economic activity to come up with their forecast. One factor taken into account was \"carbon intensity\", the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity. The approach is different from that taken by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose most recent report included future warming rates based on four carbon emission scenarios. Professor Adrian Raftery, who led the University of Washington team, said: \"The big problem with scenarios is that you don't know how likely they are, and whether they span the full range of possibilities or are just a few examples. Scientifically, this type of storytelling approach was not fully satisfying. \"Our analysis is compatible with previous estimates, but it finds that the most optimistic projections are unlikely to happen. We're closer to the margin than we think. \"Overall, the goals expressed in the Paris Agreement are ambitious but realistic. The bad news is they are unlikely to be enough to achieve the target of keeping warming at or below 1.5 degrees.\" The findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change. A separate study in the same journal found that even if all fossil fuel emissions were halted this year, global temperatures were very likely to be 1.3C higher than pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. There was a 13% chance that the Earth was already committed to 1.5C warming by 2100, said the authors led by Dr Thorsten Mauritsen, from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany.

The 83-year-old Brown, who left office in 2019, serves as executive chairman of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which sets the  Doomsday Clock  measuring how close humanity is to self-destruction. He's also on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative.  In an interview with The Associated Press, Brown commended President  Joe Biden  for not raising the U.S. nuclear threat level after Russian President  Vladimir Putin  made veiled threats to use his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal amid its war in  Ukraine . Brown also urged Biden to resist Republican calls to increase oil production as gasoline prices soar. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the Russians are earning money from oil and gas, but to compound that problem by accelerating oil and gas in America would go against the climate goals, and climate is like war: If we don\u2019t handle it, people are going to die and they\u2019re going to be suffering. Not immediately, but over time,\u201d said Brown, a Democrat. Brown spoke to the AP last week from his home in rural Colusa County, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento. The land in California's inner coastal mountain range has been in Brown's family since the 1860s, when his great-grandfather emigrated from Germany and built a stagecoach stop known as the Mountain House. The home Brown and his wife, Anne Gust Brown, finished building in 2019 is called Mountain House III. The home is powered entirely by solar panels and is not connected to any local utility.  Though Brown is retired from electoral politics after serving a record four terms as California's governor \u2014 from 1975 to 1983 and 2011 to 2019 \u2014 he is hardly absent from public life. Brown has organized conversations with John Kerry, Biden's special presidential envoy for climate; Xie Zhenhua, China's climate envoy; and former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. He created and chairs the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, which aims to boost collaboration on climate-related research and technology.  \u201cNo matter how antagonistic things get, cooperation is still the imperative to deal with climate and nuclear proliferation,\u201d he said.  At the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, he brings an important political perspective as its scientists consider how to get their message out, said Rachel Bronson, the group's president. Last week, he joined the organization's science and security board as they formulated a statement on Putin's nuclear threats.  The scientists decided to not update the Doomsday Clock, which in 2020 was moved ahead 20 seconds to be set at 100 seconds to midnight, the metaphorical time representing global catastrophe. They did, however, warn Russia's invasion has brought to life the \u201cnightmare scenario\" that nuclear weapons could be used to escalate a \u201cconventional conflict.\"  Bronson pursued Brown for a leadership role as his governorship ended because of the deep interest he\u2019d shown on its nuclear work and his capacity to understand big threats. \u201cHe thinks about existential risk,\u201d Bronson said.  Indeed, Brown is a deep thinker on any number of issues, from hummingbirds to the very meaning of life and death. He trained to be a Jesuit priest but eventually abandoned those ambitions to follow his father into politics. Edmund \u201cPat\" Brown was California governor from 1959-1967.  Jerry Brown brings a philosophical approach to life and work, often ready with a Latin phrase or motto to summarize his views. He has long lamented that the buildup of nuclear weapons and climate change fail to capture enough attention in the face of more immediate concerns \u2014 these days the coronavirus and inflation.  \u201cWe have to have enough bandwidth to look at the big issues, because if they get away from us we won\u2019t have the little issues to worry about,\u201d Brown said. He warned a Republican takeover of the U.S. House after this fall's midterms, coupled with the possibility of the Supreme Court limiting the federal government's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, would make a climate \u201ccatastrophe all the more likely.\"  Though Brown has long contemplated the fate of the planet, he's perhaps more connected to it than ever before. He gets his power from the sun and water from a well. Fueled by climate change, California's wildfires have become hotter, more unpredictable and more destructive in recent years and the location of Brown's 2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) ranch has him living closer to the threat than ever.  He zips around the property on his ATV studying the trees and flowers, determined to learn their names, and in the fall he hosts friends to help harvest olives, which he has pressed into oil.  He's offered his property as a meeting space for the California Native Plant Society, entomologists, and forestry and fire experts. Last fall the forest experts put together a declaration calling for the state to focus on better forest management to decrease the severity of wildfires. Many of their suggestions mirrored those being pursued by Gov.  Gavin Newsom 's administration. The entomologists, meanwhile, spent two days on the ranch for a planning retreat about how to protect California's insects. Brown allowed them to survey his land and two researchers found new species \u2014 an ant and a beetle, said Dan Gluesenkamp, executive director of the California Institute for Biodiversity and organizer of the retreat.  Brown joined the scientists for meals to grill them on their research. He \u201cclearly reveled in sitting around the picnic table for dinner and having super hardcore conversations with the smartest entomologists on the planet,\" Gluesenkamp said.  Sitting outside his home, Brown said he recently pondered what might have been had he won one of his three presidential campaigns, the last in 1992. He decided he'd much rather be in Colusa County. \u201cI\u2019m very happy where I am \u2014 it's a very amazing place. I can\u2019t imagine being in a better place,\" he said. He then wondered aloud whether he could have avoided the same mistakes as those who became president. Then he quickly switched to considering why a hummingbird that caught his eye was moving so quickly from tree to tree.

The recommendations, made by the  Committee on Climate Change  on Thursday, would replace previous targets agreed in 2008, which aimed to reduce damaging greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent what they were in 1990. The CCC report explains the need for considerable changes to many ways British people live if we are to meet the target. These include major changes to how we generate power, heat our homes, what food we eat and  farming  practices. Millions of homes will have to make the switch to low-carbon heating, people will need to eat less beef, lamb and dairy, and dispose of waste more efficiently, the report states. AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty We also need to move towards electric vehicles, but less road traffic, with more people  walking ,  cycling  and using public transport.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at having as fulfilled, as different, as various a life as we have today, if not more, but to do it in a way in which we take responsibility for the future by respecting the planet which gives us life and by having different attitude to the usage of resources,\u201d said committee chairman Lord Deben. Despite necessarily calling for major changes within our society, the report\u2019s aims have been well received in many sectors including energy and business bodies as well as environmental and farming groups. The widespread enthusiasm for the target comes amid a huge swell in interest in climate change spurred-on by school strikers inspired by  Greta Thunberg , the  Extinction Rebellion  protests,  Sir David  Attenborough \u2019s BBC documentary on climate change, and cross party parliamentary support for measures to tackle some of the problems. The report also lands days after the  Bank of England  governor Mark Carney  warned banks  they cannot ignore the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effects of climate change and must be at the heart of tackling the problem. Mr Carney called on governments and financial institutions to take a pivotal role in keeping temperature rises \u201cwell below 2C\u201d and said the \u201cenormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing\u201d. Moving to a  low-carbon economy  will require a \u201cmassive reallocation of capital\u201d, he and Bank of France governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau said in an article for  The Guardian . \u201cIf some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\u201d they wrote. The Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) which represents 190,000 businesses across the country has called the CCC report a \u201cnew dawn for climate change action\u201d and is demanding a \u201cstep change in government policy\u201d to meet the target. It also cited recent protests as indicative of the \u201csense of urgency\u201d required to tackle the crisis. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe Committee on Climate Change\u2019s report and recommendations mark a new dawn for climate change action in the UK. \u201cThe UK, and its devolved administrations, already have ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions across a range of sectors. But the evidence that the UK must go a major step further and become carbon neutral by 2050 is substantial. \u201cIf we are to reach the new target, we need a step change in government policy, business action and the way each of us lives our lives. \u201cRecent protests have shown the strength of public passion and sense of urgency that the UK should do all it can to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, on society, the economy and the environment. What we need now is a supportive and timely response from the UK government to enact this ambitious target, so businesses and the public can get on with reaching it.\u201d This was echoed by his colleague Matthew Fell, the chief UK policy director at the CBI, who said: \u201cBusiness is up for the net zero challenge \u2013 and many companies have made their own pledges for a net zero target. This is partly driven by public demand for action on climate change. But there are also economic opportunities ahead.\u201d Also among those calling on the government to put policy in place to help smooth the path towards a greener future is the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), which represents over 170 investor members with over \u00a319 trillion in assets under management. These include BlackRock, Linklaters, Nest, and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. Stephanie Pfeifer, the chief executive of IIGCC, said: \u201cA commitment to reduce emissions to net-zero by 2050 would be a clear signal of global climate leadership by the UK.  \u201cGovernment now needs to implement the policies to achieve this goal and attract the investment required to create a clean economy. With the Bank of England highlighting that $20 trillion of global assets are on the line as a result of climate change, a robust policy response is also a simple economic necessity.\u201d David Smith, the chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, the industry body funded by UK gas and electricity transmission said the group supported the target, but also said there was \u201cno silver bullet\u201d and homes should continue to use some gas, which is not compatible with the targets.   Mr Smith said: \u201cWe back the CCC\u2019s advice that to move beyond an 80% target and deliver net zero emissions by 2050, low-carbon hydrogen will be an absolute necessity within our energy system. We echo their calls for carbon, capture, usage and technology to be deployed at scale and quickly, as it is essential to the development of a hydrogen economy. Energy networks will be at the heart of this transition.   \u201cThere will be no silver bullet to reaching net zero, with energy networks leading innovation needed across major sectors of the economy including heating, power and transportation. Given the vital role that gas networks have to play in decarbonising heat, we believe the public should be allowed to benefit from new technologies such as smart hybrid heating systems and that new homes should continue to be connected to the gas grid. Already, homes right across the UK are receiving low-carbon green gas, with the government committed to increasing this.\u201d Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the report indicated nuclear power can continue to play a role in the UK\u2019s power supply.  He said: \u201cThe Committee on Climate Change\u2019s report rightly highlights just how far we still need to go for the UK to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In decarbonising power, it highlights that we will need more low carbon sources of electricity \u2013 confirming other academic and expert reports \u2013 with nuclear continuing to play an integral part alongside renewables.\u201d Energy company Drax has also said it supported the plans. The company operates the largest biomass-fuelled power station in Europe, near Selby in North Yorkshire. The firm currently receives government green energy subsidies, but last month protesters claimed burning biomass at Drax produces as much carbon as burning coal. Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said: \u201cWe stand ready to implement the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s recommendations and scale up the successful BECCS pilot at Drax to create the world\u2019s first negative emissions power station in the mid-2020s.  \u201cBioenergy with carbon capture is the cornerstone around which a low carbon economy can be built: Crucial for tackling climate change, it will also create new jobs and export opportunities for British businesses.\u201d Dr Marie Claire Brisbois, a lecturer in energy policy at the University of Sussex, said the report was an opportunity for the government to significantly improve people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe zero carbon target is more than just an energy target, it represents an opportunity to substantially improve the quality of life for all British citizens,\u201d she said.   \u201cInvestment in areas such as public and active transportation and energy efficient buildings will not only address direct carbon emissions, but also improve uptake of energy efficient behaviours, reduce energy poverty and help mitigate the ongoing crises in physical and mental health.\u201d Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at the  WWF , said the recommendations must be put into practice as soon as possible.  He said: \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve been acting as if we have time. But if we want a world with coral reefs, safe coastal cities and enough food for everyone, we must act now. That\u2019s why we welcome the CCC\u2019s advice that we must end our emissions as soon as possible, but certainly no later than the middle of the century. The National Trust was also strongly supportive of the report\u2019s recommendations.  The trust\u2019s outdoors and natural resources director, Patrick Begg, said: \u201cLast year\u2019s extraordinary heatwave, made thirty times more likely by climate change, and the impact it had on British farmers and wildlife, remind us of the urgency of the threat.  \u201cThe government must now act without delay to adopt a net zero target so we can get on with the task of limiting climate change by making farming more sustainable for both farmers and for nature, and by locking away more carbon through the restoration of important habitats.\u201d Martin Harper, the director of conservation at the  RSPB , said a net zero emissions target would help avoid the \u201cworst effects\u201d of the climate crisis. He said: \u201cClimate change is one of the biggest threats to our wildlife, but nature also holds part of the solution for tackling this crisis. Protecting and restoring our woodlands, bogs and grasslands to help lock up carbon is essential in the fight to prevent the worst effects. Today\u2019s CCC report highlights the valuable role nature can play in addressing the climate crisis alongside the urgent need to raise our ambition across every sector if we are to be successful.\u201d Last year the CCC said the number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half as they are the species contributing the most emissions. The advice said that a 20-50 per cent reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7 million hectares of grassland from the current 12 million hectares in the UK. The grassland could then be repurposed to grow forests and biofuels to help soak up CO2. The advice was not welcomed by farmers, with the  NFU  saying at the time it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers. However, the NFU recently announced its own 2040 UK net zero emissions target for agriculture. In a statement it did not mention the need to cut livestock numbers, but Minette Batters, the union\u2019s president said: \u201cLast year\u2019s extreme weather was a stark reminder of the challenges farmers face in maintaining yields and feeding livestock on the frontline of climate change. But not only can agriculture be part of the solution, we can also be a world leader in climate-friendly production.\u201d She added: \u201cTechnology and the bioeconomy present huge opportunities and that is why earlier this year I unveiled an ambitious aspiration for net zero agriculture in the UK by 2040. In order to achieve that, we will need to see the government work with farmers and growers on the new technology and innovation needed to reach this goal.\u201d Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, which promotes sustainable agriculture in the UK also cited the 2018 summer heatwave being made more likely by climate breakdown. He said it was \u201ca reminder to all farmers that we are on the frontline of climate change. But we can be a big part of the solution.\u201d He also failed to address the call to reduce beef and lamb herds so pastures can be replaced with forest, but added: \u201cFarmers right across the country are already finding ways to cut the emissions, be that through altering the way we feed our livestock, to better managing our soils to keep them healthy. For the sake of British farming and our food production we have to halt climate change, and that means setting and hitting a net zero target as soon as possible.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

This includes a\u00a0range of habitats from bog, to fen, reedbed, pond, wet meadow, wet woodland or washland. They are found all over the world. A healthy wetland is one of the most ecologically abundant places on earth. Wetlands are a\u00a0natural habitat of Britain but many of them have been altered almost beyond recognition. Wetlands vary greatly: Some wetlands are very extensive, such as blanket bog, while others are smaller sites, such as upland spring and flush. In other cases, particularly in the lowlands, drainage and industrial-scale peat-cutting has reduced or destroyed many wetlands. Areas of raised bog, fen and reedbed are now a fraction of what they once were. Some types of wetlands are now legally protected, but many are still in a poor condition. More than 140,000 described species \u2013 including 55 per cent of all fishes \u2013 rely on freshwater habitats for their survival. Freshwater species are important to local ecosystems, provide sources of food and income to humans and are key to flood and erosion control. Yet wetland species are going extinct more rapidly than terrestrial or  marine species , with almost a third of all freshwater biodiversity facing extinction due to invasive species, pollution, habitat loss and over-harvesting. Also, plant matter steadily decays and accumulates in the waterlogged conditions of wetlands. Wetlands store more carbon than any other ecosystem, with peatlands alone storing\u00a0twice as much as all the world\u2019s forests, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Inland wetland  ecosystems , also absorb excess water and help prevent floods and drought, widely seen as critical to helping communities adapt to a changing climate. However,\u00a0the ability of a freshwater wetland habitat to capture carbon varies according to the condition of the wetland. Good management is critical to ensuring that the habitat can store more carbon for years to come. It is\u00a0also vital\u00a0that remaining high-quality wetlands are protected, as it can take decades for restored wetlands to be able to draw down  carbon  at the same rate as natural wetlands. \u201cHealthy wetlands \u2013 critical for climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, and human health and prosperity \u2013 punch above their weight in terms of benefits,\u201d says Leticia Carvalho, Principal Coordinator for Marine and Freshwater at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). \u201cMaking sure that they continue to deliver vital ecosystem services to humanity requires\u2026 their prioritisation, protection, restoration, better management and monitoring.\u201d Wetlands are one of the Earth\u2019s most threatened habitats. Some 85 per cent of wetlands present in 1700 were lost by 2000, many drained to make way for development, farming or other \u201cproductive\u201d uses. Disappearing three times faster than forests, their loss spells an existential threat for hundreds of thousands of animal and plant species. Scientists estimate that 64 per cent of the world\u2019s\u00a0 wetlands \u00a0have disappeared since 1900. In the latest Global Wetland Outlook paper, researchers reported that 35 per cent of wetland habitat losses have happened since 1970. The results can be catastrophic. Nearly a fifth of the\u00a0 world \u2019s\u00a0 dragonflies \u00a0and damselflies are at risk of\u00a0 extinction , a nature conservation group has found. The destruction of wetland habitats is driving the\u00a0 decline ; for example in\u00a0 Southeast Asia \u00a0where\u00a0 rainforest \u00a0and wetland areas are being cleared to make room for crops such as palm oil. Some 16 per cent out of 6,016 species of dragon and damselflies are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) red list of threatened species. The good news is that protection, sustainable management and restoration of wetlands work. Improving management of wetlands brings health, food and water security benefits \u2013 critical to the health and livelihoods of four billion people reliant on wetlands\u2019 services, says the Global Wetland Outlook.

Populations have been in freefall for decades due to a combination of overfishing, pollution and dams being constructed along rivers, blocking their traditional migration routes. Numbers of the once abundant  fish  have dropped by over 90 per cent since the early 1980s and now rising temperatures and acidic waters are posing yet another existential threat. A new study conducted by scientists in Portugal tested the impact of the rising global temperatures on the survival and behaviour of young eels. These \u201cglass eels\u201d \u2013 so-called due to their transparent bodies \u2013 were placed in different conditions to see how they would respond to a temperature increase of 4C and more acidic water, mimicking the environments expected under climate change by the end of the century. AFP\/Getty Alan Schaller Nasa\/Getty Ross Wills AP Reuters AFP\/Getty Art Wolfe When placed in warmer water, fewer of the young eels survived, but those that did were more active and appeared more willing to continue their migration. This was countered by the impact of the acidic water, which appeared to dampen the eels\u2019 innate desire to migrate towards freshwater. This result echoed previous studies showing acidic water harming the sensory abilities of fish. Publishing their findings in the  Biology Letters  journal, the scientists said they had revealed how near future conditions could soon trigger unexpected and unwelcome changes in eel populations. \u201cIf greenhouse gases emissions to the atmosphere continue unabated and further conservation management policies are not considered in the near future, these stressors may, indeed, cause stocks disruption and push eels towards extinction,\u201d said Dr Tiago Grilo, one of the scientists at the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre behind the study. Dr Reinhold Hanel, an eel expert at the Thunen Institute in Germany who was not involved in the study, said he \u201cfully agreed\u201d climate change is impacting eels. He added that the new study supported previous work suggesting climate change was harming the eels by tampering with ocean currents along their migration routes or the Sargasso Sea where they spawn. However, he also noted that for fish that travel more than 4,000 miles simply to reproduce, crossing both fresh and saltwater as they do, climate change was just one of many pressures on these vulnerable creatures. \u201cIf you travel that far\u2026 you are at risk in many circumstances, and that is why it is the sum of these impacts that probably caused this decline,\u201d he said. Samuel Stone, head of fisheries and aquaculture at the Marine Conservation Society, said the research was a reminder of the \u201cdire need\u201d to recover depleted fish stocks. \u201cWe are already seeing impacts of climate change on marine species and far more needs to be done to account for this in fisheries management,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile  As President  Joe Biden  visited one disaster site after another this summer \u2014 from  California  wildfires to hurricane-induced flooding in Louisiana and New York \u2014 he said climate change is \u201ceverybody\u2019s crisis\u201d and  America  must get serious about the \u201ccode red\u201d danger posed by global warming. In many ways, the president is making up for lost time. Biden and Democrats are pursuing a sweeping $3.5 trillion federal overhaul that includes landmark measures to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in what would be the most consequential environmental policies ever enacted, after years of fits and starts. Sidelined after the former administration withdrew from the landmark Paris climate accord \u2014 the 2015 global effort to confront climate change \u2014 the U.S. has returned to the arena, with Biden promising world leaders in April that the U.S. would cut carbon pollution in half by 2030.  But following through on Biden's climate goals depends in large part on passage of the Democratic package, and it will take the  White House  s heft to close the deal between centrist and progressive lawmakers, including disputes over its climate provisions. \u201cThat\u2019s where he earns his legacy,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said of Biden. As Democrats rush to finish a package that touches almost all aspects of American life, the proposals related to climate change are proving to be a sticking point, particularly among key centrist lawmakers.  The president was meeting Tuesday with Democratic Sens.  Joe Manchin  of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona as Democrats chip away at the package's overall price tag and marshal support. With Republicans in lockstep against the plan, Democrats have few votes to spare as they try to pass it on their own. \u201cThis is Speaker Pelosi\u2019s grand socialist agenda to destroy freedom and embolden our enemies on the backs of American families,\u2033 said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce panel. Yet, for many Democrats, and voters who elected them \u2014 the climate provisions are among the most important elements of the sweeping bill. A poll last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows 83% of Democrats are very concerned about climate change, compared with just 21% of Republicans. \u201cThis is a \u2018Code Red\u2019 moment, but Democrats are answering the call,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Florida, chairwoman of a special House committee on climate change.  \u201cOur only hope to avoid catastrophe is to act with urgency -- to act now,\u2019\u2019 Castor said Tuesday at the Capitol. She called climate change \u201ca clear and present danger to American families who are facing brutal heat waves, devastating floods, failed electric grids and historic wildfires.''  The Democratic plan will make historic investments in clean energy, climate resilience and environmental justice, she said. \u201cWe have to get this right.'' Included in the massive legislation is a nationwide clean-electricity program that is intended to eliminate climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035 \u2014 catching up to requirements already set in some states.  The proposal would spend billions to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations and upgrade the power grid to make it more resilient during hurricanes and other extreme weather events that are increasing and intensifying as a result of climate change.  The measure also would create a New Deal-style Civilian Climate Corps to unleash an army of young people to work in public lands and restoration projects.  \u201cThe climate crisis is here, and the cost of inaction is already staggering,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone, D-N.J. The U.S. had 22 climate and weather disasters in 2020 with losses exceeding $1 billion each. Hurricane Ida and other recent disasters are likely to cost tens of billions more. A slimmer $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill the House is set to consider Thursday addresses some of these priorities, with money for climate resiliency, water system upgrades and other provisions. But progressive Democrats say a far more comprehensive approach is needed if the U.S is to have a chance to achieve Biden's goal of cutting the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in half, leaving both packages at a standstill as talks continue behind the scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s about the livability of this planet,\u2033 said Huffman, a progressive caucus member who said Democrats were \u201cunwilling to just be steamrolled on that.\u201d But Manchin has said he will not support a number of clean energy and climate provisions. As the powerful chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Manchin has vowed to protect jobs in his coal and gas-producing state and said the price tag for the Democratic bill is too high. Manchin and Sinema are not alone in raising objections. Seven House Democrats from Texas said provisions in the Democratic plan could cost thousands of jobs in the energy industry and increase energy costs for Americans. \u201cThese taxes and fees, as well as the exclusion of natural gas production from clean energy initiatives, constitute punitive practices,\u2033 the Texas lawmakers said in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The letter was signed by Reps. Henry Cuellar, Vicente Gonzalez, Lizzie Fletcher, Sylvia Garcia, Marc Veasey, Filemon Vela and Colin Allred. Overall, the Biden package aims to provide more than $600 billion to tackle climate change and lower greenhouse gas emissions, funded in large part by taxes on corporations, the wealthy and other fees, keeping to Biden's pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. One alternative for raising revenues would be to impose a carbon tax. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Monday he is developing legislation \u201cthat would make polluters pay for the costs of the climate crisis.\u201d But Wyden and others are mindful of Biden\u2019s pledge not to hit pocketbooks of Americans and the senator said the carbon tax is being developed as part of a menu of options for consideration. Environmental groups have hailed the overall package, calling it a once-in-a-generation opportunity. \u201cInvesting in new clean energy technologies is one of the best things we can do to create good jobs for regular people right now while reaping long-term benefits and a healthier planet for decades to come,\u201d said Matthew Davis of the League of Conservation Voters. The clean-energy standard alone could create millions of jobs, while driving the U.S. electricity sector toward zero-carbon emissions, Davis and other advocates said. With elections around the corner, approval of the bill is crucial, Democrats say. \u201cIf we miss this moment,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D- R.I., referring to Democratic control of Congress and the White House, \"it is not clear when we will have a second chance.'' ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this story.

The Greenland ice sheet alone holds enough water to raise the planet\u2019s sea level by 7.4 metres, according to Nasa, and the impacts of climate breakdown are being acutely felt in the  Arctic , where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. The team of US scientists used detailed new reconstructions of ancient climate patterns to drive computer models showing how the ice behaves in various circumstances, and compared it with real-world measurements of the sheet\u2019s contemporary and ancient size. The new model indicates the loss of ice from Greenland by the end of this century is likely to contribute to sea level rises of between 2cm and 10cm. The findings highlight \u201cjust how extreme and unusual projected losses for the 21st century could be\u201d, the researchers said. \u201cBasically, we've altered our planet so much that the rates of ice sheet melt this century are on pace to be greater than anything we've seen under natural variability of the ice sheet over the past 12,000 years,\u201d said Jason Briner, professor of geology in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, who led the study. \u201cWe'll blow that out of the water if we don't make severe reductions to greenhouse gas emissions,\" he added. The research team compared different climate scenarios which assume varying levels of greenhouse gas emissions, called representative concentration pathways (RCPs), to model what the human impact could be on the ice sheet. These include RCP 2.6, which assumes radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases will peak in the mid-21st Century and then decline as emissions sharply drop off, and the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d RCP 8.5, which assumes rapid and unrestricted economic growth along with the rampant burning of fossil fuels. Prof Briner said: \u201cIf the world goes on a massive energy diet, in line with a scenario that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls RCP 2.6, our model predicts that the Greenland ice sheet's rate of mass loss this century will be only slightly higher than anything experienced in the past 12,000 years. \u201cBut, more worrisome, is that under a high-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario - the one the Greenland ice sheet is now following - the rate of mass loss could be about four times the highest values experienced under natural climate variability over the past 12,000 years.\u201d Prof Briner and his colleagues from institutions including Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Washington, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), and the University of California, said the results \u201creiterate the need for countries around the world to take action now to reduce emissions, slow the decline of ice sheets, and mitigate sea level rise.\u201d The multidisciplinary team used state-of-the-art ice sheet modelling to simulate changes to the southwestern sector of the Greenland ice sheet, starting from the beginning of the Holocene epoch some 12,000 years ago and then extending forward 80 years to 2100. The team was able to test the model's accuracy by comparing their results with historical evidence.  The modelled results matched up well with data from actual measurements of the ice sheet made by satellites and aerial surveys in recent decades, as well as with field work identifying the ice sheet\u2019s ancient boundaries. Though the project focused on southwestern Greenland, the team said the research indicates changes in the rates of ice loss found there tend to correspond tightly with changes across the entire ice sheet. \u201cWe relied on the same ice sheet model to simulate the past, the present and the future,\u201d said co-author Jessica Badgeley, a PhD student at the University of Washington.  \u201cThus, our comparisons of the ice sheet mass change through these time periods are internally consistent, which makes for a robust comparison between past and projected ice sheet changes.\u201d The study represents the first time such timescales have been modelled with confidence, the researchers said. \u201cWe have long timelines of temperature change, past to present to future, that show the influence of greenhouse gases on Earth's temperature,\u201d Prof Briner said. \u201cNow, for the first time, we have a long timeline of the impacts of that temperature - in the form of Greenland ice sheet melt - from the past to present to future. And what it shows is eye-opening.\u201d Co-author Nicol\u00e1s Young, associate research professor at LDEO, said the reliability of the modelling combined with the timescale studied made it hard to pick holes in the results. He said: \u201cIt is no secret that the Greenland ice sheet is in rough shape and is losing ice at an increasing rate. \u201cBut if someone wants to poke holes in this, they could simply ask, 'how do you know this isn't just part of the ice sheet's natural variability?' Well, what our study suggests is that the rate of ice loss for this century will exceed the rate of ice loss for any single century over the last 12,000 years. I think this is the first time that the current health of the Greenland ice sheet has been robustly placed into a long-term context.\" Despite the study\u2019s \u201csobering\u201d findings, the team said it was \u201cvital\u201d to note that the projections show it is still possible for people and countries around the world to make an important difference by cutting emissions. \u201cOur findings are yet another wake-up call, especially for countries like the US,\u201d Prof Briner said. \u201cAmericans use more energy per person than any other nation in the world. Our nation has produced more of the CO2 that resides in the atmosphere today than any other country.  \u201cAmericans need to go on an energy diet. The most affluent Americans, who have the highest energy footprint, can afford to make lifestyle changes, fly less, install solar panels and drive an energy-efficient vehicle.\u201d The research is published in the journal  Nature .

This is how I felt at last week\u2019s press conference launching the  annual report of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC)  to the UK parliament. Buried in the report was the advice that the government needed to start preparing for a 4C temperature rise. This is a terrifying change from the previous advice to prepare for a 2C rise. Why terrifying? As Professor Kevin Anderson, a leading climate scientist at the University of Manchester,  said : \u201cThere is a widespread view that a 4C future is incompatible with an organised global community, is likely to be beyond adaptation and be devastating to the majority of  ecosystems .\u201d In other words, a world where food crops would collapse, billions could starve, governments collapse and coastal cities flood, making hundreds of millions homeless. The committee did not set out how any government could prepare for such a catastrophe; it just warned that it needed to. What it did do, however, was report on the actions taken \u2013 or not taken \u2013 to date as part of the UK government\u2019s contribution to holding the rise in temperatures under 2C, the absolute limit beyond which it would be insanity to pass. On the positive side, reductions in UK domestic emissions since 2008 are the best among member countries in the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development . Domestic emissions, which are the carbon emissions emitted in the UK itself, are down 28 per cent. However, domestic emissions exclude UK international aviation and shipping emissions, or those from the goods we import. The jargon for UK emissions that includes these figures is \u201cconsumption emissions\u201d, and these are 18 per cent down since 2008. In total, 54 per cent of UK consumption emissions are emitted inside UK borders, while a surprising 46 per cent are emitted in the countries that we import food and goods from. The large amount of emissions from new oil, gas and coalfields that UK banks and the government fund in other countries around the world are not included in either statistic \u2013 and it is estimated that 15 per cent of global  fossil fuel financing  comes from the UK. Yet these huge UK emissions were entirely missing from the committee\u2019s report. The committee attributed the positive decline in domestic emissions to the rapid phasing out of coal and the switch to  renewables  for electricity. However, the report was blunt on the failure of  Boris Johnson \u2018s government to implement almost any of its recommendations made last year on how to get to zero carbon. Of the 31 recommendations, only two were implemented in full. And let us be honest: the zero carbon 2050 target set by the government, with the  CCC  advising on how to achieve it, is far too late if humanity is to avoid a 4C rise in temperatures. We are in the invidious position of having a report that is far too reticent in the actions it recommends to protect Britain, and says that the vast majority of even these actions are being ignored by the government. On the climate threat, we are exactly where we were last winter in relation to the impending pandemic: woefully unprepared and with a government refusing to implement the advice being given to protect us. The committee\u2019s report has many major gaps. There is no mention of the role that the Bank of England should play in halting the billions pouring from UK banks into fossil fuel corporations in loans, or any advice on how the Bank\u2019s \u00a3300bn  quantitative easing programme  could green the economy. The carbon emissions reported for road vehicles excluded the large embedded carbon used in manufacturing them. There are an estimated 2.3 million  new cars bought  in the UK each year. If the average embedded carbon emissions were 5 tonnes per vehicle, this would add another 11.5 million tonnes to the annual 113 million tonnes of emissions for surface transport. The report also failed to urge the government to reach the UN target of 20 per cent of the transport budget for cycling, which the new government in Ireland has just adopted, and made no mention of how  e-bikes  could eliminate the need for car ownership for millions of commuters. It carried no comparative carbon or cost-benefit analysis for the different forms of zero-carbon heating, whether hydrogen, infrared, electric boilers or heat pumps. It relied heavily on the introduction of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology to trap industrial and biomass emissions, but admitted that they do not know if it can be done economically. The focus on carbon capture is hardly surprising given the influence of carbon-based industries. They are promoting this economically unproven technology, as it would theoretically allow them to continue burning biomass and  fossil fuels . It is unconscionable that the committee should be betting the UK\u2019s future on an unproven technology, when so many proven methods already exist. What also jumps out from the report is that just like the prime minister failing to attend almost all of the Cobra emergency committee meetings as the  Covid-19  emergency began in the UK, the committee reports that Johnson has only convened one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change \u2013 a group that experts agree needs to meet monthly if the government is to succeed in hitting zero-carbon targets. When I reported back to one of my friends on the substance of the report and press conference, his visceral response was, \u201cWe are f*****\u201d. I am inclined to agree \u2013 which is why mass peaceful direct actions by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and the student climate  strikers  are a duty, not a luxury. That is, if we want a government that actually acts on the experts\u2019 warnings, rather than ignoring them as Johnson did so disastrously over Covid-19.

Nothing beats peat. It\u2019s nature\u2019s vault, writes  William Booth   Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Scientist Chris Field of Manchester Metropolitan University measures water temperature and nutrient levels at Winmarleigh and Cockerham Moss, Lancashire\u2019s largest peatland M oor, bog, fen, mire, flush, swamp, slough.  Peatlands  have gotten a bum rap. They\u2019re inhospitable, useless. Too wet to plough, too dry to fish, the old farmers say. Slagged off as anaerobic wastelands, dissed in the popular imagination, imagined as the eerie Dead Marshes in  The Lord of the Rings  or the forbidding Grimpen Mire in  The Hound of the Baskervilles . When bad things go down in  Charles Dickens , the scene is set in a forbidding moor. All slander, says Christian Dunn, wetlands scientist at  Bangor University  in  north Wales . \u201cPeat is the superhero of the natural world,\u201d he says. These waterlogged, acidic, low-nutrient ecosystems are the world\u2019s most carbon-dense lands. You want to safely store carbon for a thousand years? Nothing beats peat. It\u2019s nature\u2019s vault. From the boreal north to the tropical south, from Scotland\u2019s grouse moors to the vast tracts recently discovered in the Congo Basin, the Earth\u2019s peatlands store twice as much carbon as all the planet\u2019s forests combined \u2013 though they cover only a tenth of the landmass. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about slowing  climate change ,\u201d Dunn says, \u201cyou must get serious about peat.\u201d Most people, if they think about peat at all, might think, meh, garden mulch? Long before the industrial revolution began, farmers were emitting carbon by turning over the peat to plant crops (Dunn begs you: \u201cDo not buy peat to feed your petunias.\u201d Its sale is being phased out in Britain. In America, availability remained unrestricted.) Climate scientists have long appreciated the role oceans and forests play to store mega-amounts of carbon. But only now is the power of peat coming into sharper focus \u2013 along with the need to preserve the pristine bogs that remain and restore what\u2019s been damaged. Alongside this new respect comes anxiety among researchers that the carbon buried within these mires can be rapidly released in a warming world. Peatlands are only 3 per cent of the land surface but store as much as 30 per cent of all the carbon locked in the soil. Release that, and the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will go kaboom, accelerating the Earth on its trajectory towards catastrophic warming. It\u2019s scary enough that climatologists have a term for the scenario: a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d hidden in all that peat. \u201cFor centuries, we\u2019ve drained peatlands,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cWe\u2019ve degraded the peat \u2013 trashed it, burned it, bagged it \u2013 and released just staggering amounts of carbon into our atmosphere.\u201d Long before the industrial revolution began, farmers were emitting carbon by turning over the peat to plant crops. Investigators at France\u2019s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences have found that this mass conversion could have added 250 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equivalent to seven years of current emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Sheep graze lowland fields in Lancashire. Britain was once covered in peat, but much of that land was converted for agriculture Huge amounts of peat still exist: in Canada, Russia, Finland, Europe, Alaska and around the tropics. But it is estimated that worldwide, about 15 per cent of peat has already been lost. In the modern era, farmers have even been paid by governments, encouraged by tax breaks and cash subsidies, to convert peatlands. There\u2019s a reason Indonesia is one of the top five greenhouse gas emitters in the world \u2013 and it is not just coal. It is the clearing of peat for palm oil plantations, with farmers setting fires that burn deep in the fibrous soil and smoulder for months. \u201cIt\u2019s an almost criminal amount of carbon,\u201d Dunn says. Preserving peat is now considered a powerful tool to counter climbing emissions. It is among what the United Nations considers legitimate \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d \u2013 the buzzwords for using woodlands, mangroves, marshes, kelp forests and bogs to soak up carbon. The idea is that humanity\u2019s greatest ally against climate change can be the Earth itself. Britain is one of the first countries to put peat at the centre of its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, the government is highlighting its pledge to spend more than $1bn by 2025 on peat restoration, woodland creation and the management of the two habitats. Sphagnum moss is analysed to assess water and carbon retention Prime Minister Boris Johnson in October promised to restore at least 86,000 acres of degraded peatlands in England by 2025 \u2013 and 690,000 by 2050, an area slightly larger than the size of Cheshire. The Scottish government is even more ambitious (it has less land, but more peat) and aims to repair 618,000 acres by 2030. Peatlands are wetlands, with a twist. \u201cWatch your step,\u201d says Sarah Johnson, a peat project manager with the Lancashire Wildlife Trust, which protects a bog in northeast England called Winmarleigh and Cockerham Moss. When you tread upon healthy peat, the ground can feel squishy. Your step is bouncy, like walking on a mattress, except that bounce comes from layers of plants and moss that have been laid down, at one millimetre a year, since the last Ice Age. Johnson explains that these waterlogged ecosystems are unique, because they slow decomposition way down \u2013 and so the dead plants remain, but they don\u2019t really rot, and they keep storing the carbon they removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. Water channels run between established sections of peat bog, and direct water toward newer areas, at Winmarleigh and Cockerham Moss Unlike a forest, where trees fall and decompose, recycled by insects and fungi, peat accumulates year after year. It\u2019s like the carbon cycle stops, says Chris Evans, a biogeochemist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. \u201cThe really interesting thing about peat is that it\u2019s been storing this carbon for thousands of years. It\u2019s been doing this before there were human beings,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you can keep it wet, peat can keep storing carbon for a very, very long time.\u201d A recent study by Moors for the Future Partnership in Britain examined a single blanket bog in Derbyshire and found the amount of carbon locked up was equivalent to the annual emissions of eight coal-fired power stations. Britain was once covered in peatlands. London is built on a former one. Now, most lowland peat is gone. Netting helps keep the bog intact In Holme Fen north of Cambridge, a landowner in 1848 had a post driven through 22 feet of peat until it hit the clay substrate. As the land was drained over the next 170 years, the surface of the peat subsided by 13 feet \u2013 like a shrinking sponge sitting on a kitchen countertop. Today, just 20 per cent of the United Kingdom\u2019s peatlands are considered \u201cnear natural\u201d. Much of the disturbed peat is no longer a net sink, storing carbon. It is now a source of greenhouse gases, an emitter. Scientists calculate that peatlands in Britain are releasing approximately 23 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year, making them one of the top contributors to the country\u2019s greenhouse emissions from land use. \u201cThe first thing you have to do in a leaky spaceship is plug the hole,\u201d says Richard Lindsay, a specialist in peatland ecosystems at the University of East London. Stop draining peatlands and start repairing them by keeping them wet, he says. Yet, there is an inherent tension in Britain\u2019s strategy to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century, in part through nature-based solutions. Until recently, when the government wanted to grow trees in Britain to store carbon, where did it plant them? \u201cOn the cheapest, most marginal land,\u201d Lindsay says. On peat. Wild mushrooms grow within the bog And because waterlogged trees would die, he says, \u201cyou have to drain the peat to plant the trees.\u201d Out at Winmarleigh and Cockerham Moss, they\u2019re testing a new idea: \u201ccarbon farming\u201d. In which the \u201ccrop\u201d is the carbon a farmer is locking into the peat. Mike Longden, a peatland initiative officer with the Lancashire Wildlife Trust, stood on a berm and explained the farm. The team took five aces of an unloved degraded peatland, drained in the 1970s, and rebuilt the dykes, pumps and plumbing. They stripped off the top four inches of nutrient-rich topsoil, left over from when sheep grazed the pasture, and planted 150,000 plugs of the new cover crop, sphagnum moss. Then they brought the water level back to the field to re-wet the new moss and existing five feet of unoxidized peat below. The newly planted moss is looking happy and healthy. As it grows, it will carpet the site, and the bottom of the moss will just sit there in watery acidic conditions, to form \u2013 presto! \u2013 new peat. Who will pay for it? Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery at the Wildlife Trusts, says very soon the government will probably pay land managers a few hundred pounds an acre to store carbon in a reclaimed peat bog. Corporations, too, might buy even more for credits from the carbon farmers of the future to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThe thinking is, that if you are going to get to net zero as promised in Britain, somebody is going to subsidise this,\u201d Stoneman says. For a thousand years? \u201cAt least for a while,\u201d Stoneman says. \u00a9 The Washington Post Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The new pictures, part of a wider project called \u2018Images of Change\u2019, were released by Nasa's Global  Climate Change  group and are mostly composed of before-and-after shots which demonstrate the damage left in the wake of climate related events such as severe floods and  wildfires . Also included are pictures showing more prolonged measures of climate change, such as receding  glaciers  and  desertification . One pair of pictures shows the Mekong River, an important lifeline to nearly 60 million people across southeast Asia, changing colour. \u00a0 While the water normally appears brown due to floating sediments, a section of the river in Thailand turned a bright blue in 2020. \u00a0 Mekong River in Thailand is seen before and after changing colour in 2020 Scientists said the change was due to shallow, slower moving waters not carrying as much sediment after a lengthy drought.\r\n Record large pools of meltwater on Antarctica\u2019s second-biggest glacier in 2020 are seen below a picture of the same location two years earlier Nasa also captured pictures of Antarctica's second largest ice shelf showing record amounts of meltwater.\u00a0 Scientists were concerned by the level of water, which was the highest in nearly 50 years of observation. Eastern Bangladesh seen before and after unusually severe flooding in the 2020 monsoon season Particularly striking are pictures of flooding, such as in last year\u2019s  monsoon  season in Bangladesh, where large areas of land are shown dry (before) then submerged (after). Pictures taken before and during the Kincade wildfire in California, which burned nearly 78,000 acres Nasa said the 2020 monsoon season was unusually severe and a report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs found more than 500 people were killed and more than 167,000 families were displaced across Bangladesh. Lonar Lake in India is seen before and after turning red. How the change took place remains a mystery Not all of the pictures show climate change disasters. There is one pair showing India's Lonar Lake changing colour from green to pink, an as yet unexplained phenomenon. Alaska\u2019s Mount Shishaldin before and during volcanic eruptions in January 2020 There are also plenty of pictures of volcanic eruptions. On the Philippine island of Luzon, the Taal volcano erupted on 12 January 2020 depositing wet, heavy ash over the lush green landscape.

Climate change and damage to nature are already having \u201cdire consequences\u201d, the leaders of the government agencies  Natural England  and the  Environment Agency  have said. In an article, Natural England chair Tony Juniper and the Environment Agency\u2019s Emma Howard Boyd have pointed to the recent flooding which saw hundreds of people evacuated from Fishlake,  Doncaster , with some still out of their homes. A report in October on the state of nature in the UK found two-fifths (41 per cent) of the country\u2019s wildlife species had declined over the past 50 years and 13 per cent of the species tracked were threatened with extinction in  England . The warning comes after little progress at UN climate talks in  Madrid  and ahead of a series of international meetings in 2020, including on protecting nature in  China  in October and crucial climate talks in  Glasgow  in November. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty \u201cIt\u2019s clear that 2020 is our last chance to bring the world together to take decisive action on climate change in order to protect our communities and reverse the alarming loss of wildlife we have witnessed in recent years,\u201d Mr Juniper and Ms Howard Boyd said. They said the environmental challenges of climate change and nature losses are fundamentally connected to each other. \u201cClimate change is causing damage to ecosystems, such as the droughts which are wrecking chalk rivers and wetlands, while the degradation of the natural environment, such as deforestation and drainage of peatlands, is leading to the emissions causing climate change,\u201d the two leaders said. \u201cIf we are to adapt to what are now inevitable climatic shifts, including the effects of extreme weather, then restoring the natural environment must be at the heart of our response.\u201d They said there would be \u201cevery opportunity to raise the tempo of action here in the UK\u201d in 2020, with a new environment bill expected to be presented to parliament with provisions for an ambitious national nature recovery network. The two environmental bodies have plans for large-scale woodland regeneration to store carbon, improve wildlife habitat, clean up rivers and reduce flood risk. And they said the government\u2019s commitment for a new \u00a3640m nature for climate fund in the  Conservative  election manifesto is one way national efforts could be delivered. Projects such as the efforts to prevent dozens of species being lost from the UK, or creating and restoring large areas of habitat, are helping adapt to climate change, protect wildlife and capture and store carbon. But they warned that the ambition to cut greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 was \u201conly as good as its delivery\u201d. Alongside policies and initiatives, substantial financial investments in environmental recovery would be vital \u2013 including properly resourced government agencies. \u201cOur government has the opportunity to lift plans for clean, green, healthy and resilient communities at home towards action for the whole world,\u201d Mr Juniper and Ms Howard Boyd said. \u201cIn that programme it will have our full support, for if we walk the talk, we might just persuade others to share our vision.\u201d Press Association Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

It\u2019s clear \u2013 we\u2019ve won the messaging war on climate.\u00a0 When even the most corrupt, deceitful president in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 a man who  still refuses to acknowledge  president-elect Biden\u2019s victory \u2013 concedes that climate change is driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, the debate over climate change\u2019s existence and causes is over. \u00a0There is no credible lie anymore because if there was, Donald J Trump would have used it. That \u201cyes\u201d was a white flag, an admission of a reality that can no longer be denied.\u00a0 The remaining question is no longer whether, but how, we address this crisis. In 2000, Al Gore speaking about the need for climate action was seen as inconvenient. In 2008, addressing climate change was seen as a lofty goal, the dreamy venture of the young and idealistic, rather than a kitchen table issue. In 2016, climate change was deemed a hoax by the man who would become president. But in 2020, climate change played a prominent role in the national debates, on the campaign trail, and in turning out millions of new, young voters. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made the climate crisis a centerpiece of their platform, and recently rolled out  an impressive group of climate leaders  to deliver on this promise in their administration. Even President Trump, despite spending his entire time in the White House rolling back environmental protections, tried to convince the American people of his climate credentials, signaling that there is no room to equivocate on the climate reality when push comes to shove.\u00a0 As we begin this new chapter, we have to act quickly. We need to put America on an irreversible path towards net-zero emissions.\u00a0We\u2019ve put ourselves behind the eight-ball in terms of global leadership, manufacturing capacity, and innovation. But America clearly has the capacity to catch up and lead if we are willing to work together and ensure that everyone, in every part of the country, is part of the solution.  American business is ready. American workers are ready. States like Texas are ready for wind and solar jobs. States like California are ready for cleaner air and water. The midwest is ready to create electric vehicles. The northeast is ready to build more transit-friendly housing.\u00a0 The real question is: is DC ready? I believe that we\u2019ve never been more so. The recent proposed spending package includes the biggest climate investments we\u2019ve seen. That is the bellwether of this new chapter. There is tremendous opportunity at our fingertips if we harness this political momentum, but as it\u2019s been before, our tendency towards political roadblocks and partisanship could be our detriment.\u00a0 We can\u2019t allow ourselves anymore false choices between our world and our wallets, because we know climate action is a job and prosperity creator. We can\u2019t allow ourselves to continue to see climate as a partisan issue when  both parties have messaged on climate credentials . We can\u2019t allow ourselves to see climate as a second string, back-burner political issue when it is  the  issue that mobilized the largest voting bloc in America \u2013 young people. This is an all-hands-on-deck situation, and I truly mean all hands.\u00a0 Democrats, Republicans, activists, labor leaders, and businesspeople all need to be at the table. Climate solutions touch every aspect of society and will bring opportunity to every region; that demands buy-in from everyone. It\u2019s time for Republicans to read the tea leaves and see that there is no stopping the transition of the world or the economy to a clean energy future. It\u2019s time for Democrats to build big, coalition-driven solutions, and show that we can take yes for an answer.\u00a0 It\u2019s time for America to lead on climate.\u00a0 Tom Steyer is a former Democratic presidential candidate, climate activist and billionaire hedge fund manager Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The study found small shifts in sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean could lead to weather patterns similar to the El Ni\u00f1os currently experienced over the  Pacific Ocean . The El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon is a broad, ocean-atmosphere climate interaction linked to periodic warm waters along the Equator across the central and eastern areas of the Pacific Ocean, according to the National Ocean Service. They typically occur every three to seven years and an episode can last up to two years. El Ni\u00f1os can dramatically influence weather patterns around the world and cause both flooding and droughts, depending on the region. A  study  last year found that climate change has increased the frequency of extreme  El Nino  events in the Pacific region. The El Ni\u00f1o event that ended in 2016 caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, intense droughts across Africa, South America and regions of the Pacific and southeast Asia. Wildfires in Indonesia and Canada were also linked to it. The new study, published last week in  Science Advances , found that raising or lowering the average global temperatures by just a few degrees may cause the Indian Ocean to behave in a similar way to other tropical oceans with its own El Ni\u00f1o. It could start to take effect within the next 30 years.  The Indian Ocean previously experienced El Ni\u00f1o patterns more than 20,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.  Climate scientist Pedro DiNezio, from the University of Texas at Austin who co-authored the study, told  Earther : \u201cThe re-emergence will depend strongly on the rate of global warming, so ultimately on whether greenhouse gas emissions are abated or not. \u201cWe are certain that the risks of these extreme events is becoming larger and larger as we pump more CO2 into the atmosphere, and certainly going to have an unequal impact on countries in the tropics.\u201d The team of researchers analysed 36 different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) \u2013 a collaboration by climate scientists aimed at improving knowledge of climate change. The team selected the models which match current conditions most accurately and then analysed how increased global warming might alter conditions for the Indian Ocean. According to the models, global warming could reverse the west-to-east winds in the Indian Ocean which currently keep conditions stable. If El Ni\u00f1o patterns emerge over the Indian Ocean, regions of Africa, Asia and Australasia, which are already vulnerable to the most extreme climate change impacts, may see an increase in storms, floods and droughts.

The concentration of methane in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere reached nearly 1,875 parts per billion in 2019, up from the previous year\u2019s 1,866 parts per billion, according to  preliminary data  collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  If confirmed later this year, it would be the second highest increase in methane levels in more than two decades. The NOAA began collecting global methane data in 1983. Though methane remains in the atmosphere for only a few years, it is 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping the sun\u2019s heat, and it poses an increasingly grave threat to efforts to tackle escalating global heating.  \u201cHere we are. It\u2019s 2020, and it\u2019s not only not dropping. It\u2019s not level. In fact, it\u2019s one of the fastest growth rates we\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years,\u201d Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University, told  Scientific American . Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Scientists last year warned higher methane levels will make it even harder to reach targets set by the  Paris climate change agreement .  Though uncertain about the source of the year-on-year increases, NOAA researchers have previously said much of it was  coming from the tropics .  They believe it is likely due to microbial changes in methane-belching tropical wetlands, potentially caused by warmer temperatures in what amounts to a dangerous feedback loop.  The hypothesis is that as the climate warms the efficiency of the microbial communities that convert organic matter into methane increases. But Rob Jackson, professor of Earth system science at Stanford University, said some of last year\u2019s surge was likely also due to increases from agriculture and natural gas use. In its annual  sustainability report  released last week, the fossil fuel company Shell revealed its annual methane emissions stood at 91,000 tonnes, down from 92,000 a year earlier.

Among other things, the scorching weather and lack of rain has damaged crops, and the grass used to feed farm animals too. Unfortunately the unusual may become more usual as the effects of  climate change  are felt more frequently across the world. The high ambient temperatures and humidity seen this year, as well as extreme weather conditions such as flooding, are a significant challenge to the future of  farming . Pasture-based systems of dairy production, which are very common in the UK, are particularly sensitive to environmental factors. In fact, dairy  cows  are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of climate change than cows that are housed, because housing provides shelter and technological options to mitigate the extremes of weather. Heat stress  in cows For our recent study, our team looked at how climate change might impact UK  milk production , given what we already knew about how it affects  dairy cows . In particular, we wanted to quantify the effects of heat stress on milk production. Heat stress in cows occurs when ambient temperature and humidity go above animal specific thresholds. These thresholds are estimated by the temperature humidity index (THI). At present, the current British temperature and humidity is considered moderate on this scale, but is expected to get worse. It is open to debate, and depends on the cattle themselves, but generally a THI of more than 70 is regarded to be the point when heat stress becomes a problem and less milk is produced. Using 11 different climate projection models, and 18 different milk production models, we estimated potential milk loss from UK dairy cows as climate conditions change during the 21st century. Given this information, our final climate projection analysis suggests that average ambient temperatures in the UK will increase by up to about 3.5C by the end of the century. This means that THIs during the summer, in some parts of the country, will lead to significant heat stress for cows if nothing is done to alleviate the hot weather\u2019s effects. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Lactating cows initially respond to mild heat stress by sweating, panting, drinking more, and seeking shade when possible. At higher temperatures cows eat less feed, which leads to a fall in milk production. In southeast England \u2013 the region with the highest incidence of heat stress \u2013 the average annual milk loss is projected to exceed 170kg\/cow. Cows in the UK currently produce an average of about 7,500kg of milk each year so these future losses would be about 2.4 per cent of their production. However, climate change projections also suggest the UK would experience more heatwaves, and these would lead to even greater losses of milk. For example, the hottest area (southeast England) in the hottest year in the 2090s is predicted to result in an annual milk loss exceeding 1,300kg\/cow, which is about 18.6 per cent of annual milk yield. In economic terms, southwest England is expected to be the region most vulnerable to climate change because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density, and so potentially, a high level of heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, the estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach \u00a313.4m in average years, and \u00a333.8m in extreme years. However, by the end of the century we predict dairy cattle in large portions of Scotland and Northern Ireland could experience the same level of heat stress as cattle in southern England today. Mitigation now These predictions assume that nothing is done to mitigate the problems of heat stress. But there are many parts of the world that are already much hotter than the UK where milk is produced, and much is known about what can be done to protect the welfare of the animals and minimise economic losses from heat stress. These range from simple adaptations, such as the providing shade, to installing fans and water misting systems. Cattle breeding for increased heat tolerance is another potential, which could be beneficial for maintaining pasture-based systems. In addition, changing the location of farming operations is another practice used to address economic challenges worldwide. Even though there is little indication that movement of dairy farming operations is a feasible strategy to decrease the risks of environmental challenges in the UK, regions with little or no prediction of conditions leading to heat stress (for example some parts of Scotland) may become increasingly important for UK dairy farms that depend on the availability of pasture. In any case, we estimate that by 2100, heat stress-related annual income losses of average size dairy farms in the most affected regions may vary between \u00a32,000-\u00a36,000 and \u00a36,000-\u00a314,000 (in today\u2019s value), in average and extreme years respectively. Armed with these figures, farmers need to begin planning for a hotter UK using cheaper, longer-term options such as planting trees or installing shaded areas.

The executive action saw the US recommitting to the international pact to cut global emissions and get a grip on the climate crisis.\u00a0 Donald Trump  withdrew the US from the agreement in 2017, calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d for America. \u201cI will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s all falling apart,\u201d Mr Biden said during his first presidential debate with  Donald Trump , pointing to the rampant destruction of Brazil\u2019s rainforests, happening in the vacuum of US diplomatic leadership.\u00a0 Read more:  What are Biden's plans to fight climate change? Below is a breakdown of the background, significance and future prospects of the Paris Accord - and what it means for the US to re-enter. Accord, agreement, deal, goals, pact - call it what you will, it refers to one central aim, agreed upon by almost every nation in 2015, to avoid perilous climate change by dramatically reducing global greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet. Countries set their own goals to try to curb global temperature rise, with a collective aim to stay well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it to an increasingly aspirational 1.5C.\u00a0 The consequences of the worsening climate crisis are happening all around us: melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels and extreme weather. \u00a0 Countries\u2019 current pledges are not enough to meaningfully tackle the climate crisis. The Paris agreement calls for more ambitious targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions, to be set every five years.\u00a0 The Paris deal has a \u201cratchet mechanism\u201d, meaning each nation must come out with a bolder target for reducing emissions every five years. Updated NDCs are expected by the end of 2020. The Paris deal also provides pathways for richer countries to help poorer ones, some of which are already bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, to reduced their emissions and adapt to a rapidly-changing planet. The human-driven climate crisis has already caused about 1.2C of global heating above pre-industrial levels.  The World Meteorological Organisation  said in July that there is a 20 per cent chance global temperatures will hit 1.5C in at least one year between 2020-2024. The US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter, pledged to reduce emission levels between 26-28 per cent by 2025 from 2005 levels. It is not on track to reach those goals. The European Union pledged to cut carbon pollution in 2030 by 40 per cent from 1990 levels - a greater commitment than the US. The United Kingdom has already exceeded that goal, the AP reported.  A report by leading climate scientists  in 2019 also found that of the 184 climate pledges, 128 were not on track to contribute to reducing emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, including India and China. As part of the Paris deal, former president Obama pledged $3bn toward the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries adapt. Mr Trump moved to withhold $2bn when he became president. In 2019, 27 countries announced contributions totalling $9.8bn. The US refused to contribute. Mr Trump has repeatedly mischaracterised the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October 2019, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and dubbed it \u201cone-sided\u201d. Mr Trump announced his intention to withdraw in June 2017, saying it was an end to \u201cthe draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.\u201d After the announcement a group of interdisciplinary scientists published a  report  looking at the implications of withdrawing and suggested that by the end of the century, the US could be about 5 per cent poorer with about $8 trillion in losses. A report produced by the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  for the G20 also found that climate policy can boost growth and employment. The study indicated that G20 nations could see a 5 per cent increase in growth by mid-century with a strategies for carbon reduction and climate resilience. \u201cThe US agreement is not a tax on the American people. There is no massive wealth transfer,\u201d Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, who was a lead State Department climate negotiator in the Clinton and George W Bush administrations, told AP. \u201cIn fact, the agreement obligates no country to make any financial payments.\u201d Regardless, on 4 November, 2019, the Trump administration formally notified the UN it would withdraw after the required one-year waiting period. (Part of the agreement was that no country could pull out in the first three years. Mr Trump did so on the first day possible.)

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Final report from panel of ordinary citizens backs working from home and taxes on frequent fliers Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The citizens\u2019 assembly on the  climate crisis  has urged  Boris Johnson \u2019s government to use the coronavirus pandemic to fundamentally reshape the economy so its commitment to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 can be met. Publishing its final report on Thursday, the  Climate Assembly UK  expressed support for homeworking and radical changes in transport policy \u2014 saying the \u201ctough and sad time\u201d brought on by lockdown restrictions presented an opportunity for a huge shift. \u00a0 Despite concerns over the sizeable hit suffered by the aviation industry during 2020, the assembly called on the government to bring in new taxes on flights to cut the long-term rise in air passenger numbers. The panel of more than 100 ordinary citizens \u2014 set up by six House of Commons select committees last year to give the public a bigger say \u2014 suggested the aviation taxes could \u201cincrease as people fly more often and as they fly further\u201d. Their report called for a complete ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars at some point between 2030 and 2035, asking the government to consider bringing forward the current deadline of 2035. The very highest-polluting vehicles should be phased out even sooner, the assembly said, calling for more grants for electric cars and more government investment in low-carbon buses and trains. A large majority of assembly members \u2014 79 per cent \u2014 agreed steps taken by the government to help the economy recover \u201cshould be designed to help achieve net zero\u201d. An even larger majority, 93 per cent, agreed government and employers \u201cshould take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero\u201d. \u00a0 One panel member, 56-year-old Sue from Bath, said: \u201cEven in a year like this, with the country and economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019s clear that the majority of us feel prioritising net zero policy is not only important but achievable, too.\u201d EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA Members of the public also backed moves to boost vegan and vegetarian diets. Their report recommended that government and industry encourage \u201ca voluntary change in diet\u201d so meat and dairy consumption in the UK is cut by between 20 and 40 per cent. The panel also called for more deposit return recycling schemes, an expansion in doorstep recycling and new targets to make sure businesses cut the energy and materials they use when making products. In response to calls for cross-party cooperation, the chairs of the six commissioning select committees have written to both Mr Johnson and Labour leader  Sir Keir Starmer  urging them to back the recommendations of Climate Assembly UK. The 108 assembly members were carefully selected to give a representative mix of views from the population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, \u00a0and educational level to offer a new perspective on how the government should address the climate crisis. Their report is the culmination of six weekend gatherings held throughout in 2020 \u2014 as well as a memorable address from Sir David Attenborough at the assembly\u2019s first event in Birmingham in January. Welcoming the publication of the report, chair of the business and energy select committee, Darren Jones MP, said: \u201cThis is an extremely important contribution to the debate on how the UK reaches our net zero target and I hope it gives impetus to policymakers to take bold action to reduce our emissions. \u00a0 The Labour MP added: \u201cThe fact that assembly members have been able to arrive at clear recommendations whilst respecting each others\u2019 values and experiences sets an example for us all.\u201d\r\n Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, the organisation advising the government on emissions targets, said the assembly\u2019s report showed \u201cthere is broad support for climate action in the UK\u201d. \u00a0 He said the recommendations \u201care particularly useful in considering the policies that will help achieve the goal. It\u2019s a real step forward to have this new insight\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Latest projections\u00a0predict summer rainfall will fall by almost half, while\u00a0sea\u00a0levels swallow large expanses of coastline Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Extreme  heatwaves  will scorch the UK as rising sea levels swallow large expanses of the coastline within just a few decades, experts have warned. In the first major analysis of the nation\u2019s changing climate for nearly a decade, government and  Met Office  scientists concluded that summer temperatures could shoot up by 5.4C by 2070 if fossil fuel pollution is not slashed. Winters will also be considerably hotter, with average temperatures increasing by up to 4.2C. The scientists outlined a far more extreme version of Britain\u2019s climate in which this year's weeks-long heatwave becomes the norm while winter rainfall increases by more than a third. Flooding will also be a major issue as sea levels around the country rise, and coastal communities will have to adapt rapidly or abandon homes to the rising tides. Sea levels affecting London could rise by up to 1.15 metres by 2100 if climate-warming emissions continue to climb. Even if emissions are cut in line with the Paris climate agreement to curb temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, sea levels could still be up to 70cm higher in the capital by 2100. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan The scientists also predicted significant sea level rise in other major cities, with Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast all facing water rises of over 90 cm if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Even if the world manages to curb emissions in line with the Paris agreement, the UK's average yearly temperature could be up to 2.3C higher by 2100. Launching the new report at London\u2019s Science Museum, environment secretary  Michael Gove  said no-one could predict the future with absolute certainty. However, in his first major speech on  climate change , Mr Gove \u2013 who famously claimed the public has \u201chad enough of experts\u201d in relation to Brexit \u2013 backed the scientists behind the projections. \u201cIn producing this first major update of climate projections for nearly 10 years, they have given governments, local authorities, land managers, national infrastructure bodies and other businesses an invaluable set of tools with which to assess the nature and scale of challenges, and take decisions accordingly,\u201d he said. Liz Parkes, the Environment Agency\u2019s deputy director for climate change said the report reinforced the idea that there are \u201cfewer places to hide\u201d for policy makers working on global warming-related issues. The environment secretary said the UK was already feeling climate-related extremes, including record wet winters, flooding and this year's heatwave, which was linked to devastating  wildfires  . Mr Gove told the audience at the launch event at the Science Museum that officials were already factoring projected sea level rises into planning for flooding.  He noted a new long-term approach would be needed on dealing with flooding, warning \u201cit will not always be possible to prevent every flood, we cannot build defences to protect every single building or reinforce every retreating coastline\u201d. To tackle droughts, he said new policies would help drive the construction of new water infrastructure such as reservoirs. Farmers will receive payments to tackle climate change, and there will be new strategies to repair peatland, protect and create woodlands, and tackle emissions from food waste. Mr Gove also announced that overseas, the UK will donate \u00a313 million to restoring coastal mangroves in places like Jamaica and Colombia.  The new UK Climate Projections report is meant to guide the country\u2019s efforts to curb and adapt to global warming, but environmental groups warned that many of the government\u2019s own policies were undermining such plans. \u201cClimate change will have a devastating impact on the UK with more extreme weather, rising sea levels and scorching summers \u2013 so why isn\u2019t the government doing far more to tackle this crisis?,\u201d said Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Emi Murphy. \u201cWith its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion and road building, and lukewarm support for renewable energy, the government is failing to face up to the threat of catastrophic climate breakdown. The projections were launched on the 10th anniversary of the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act. This ground-breaking strategy, which commits the country to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, has since been imitated by other nations from Sweden to New Zealand. However, given the severity of climate change warnings that have emerged in recent years, and the particularly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s  latest report , experts have called for even tougher commitments from the UK. Government climate advisers are currently examining what measures would be needed to ensure emissions are cut by effectively 100 per cent,  bringing them to \u201cnet zero\u201d , by the middle of the century.

The natural historian made the comments on Tuesday during an appearance before the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee to discuss the environmental crisis. Sir David was asked what his response would be to climate change deniers. He said that those who voice \u201ccriticism\u201d and \u201cdisbelief\u201d about climate change should be heard, but expressed dismay over individuals in positions of authority who do not believe that the issue is a matter of urgent concern. Sir David said he was \u201csorry that there are people in power internationally\u201d who are not strong advocates for tackling the environmental crisis, \u201cnotably, of course, the United States, but also in Australia, which is extraordinary actually because Australia is already having to deal with some of the most extreme manifestations of climate change\u201d. Getty Images 2004 Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images He added: \u201cBoth Australia and America \u2013 those voices are clearly heard. And one hopes that the electorate will respond to those.\u201d The broadcaster also spoke about Mr Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement on climate change. In accordance with Article 28 of the deal, the earliest point at which the US can withdraw from it is November 2020. Sir David told the committee it would be a \u201cvery sad day\u201d if the US successfully withdrew from the agreement. The broadcaster emphasised the importance of tackling climate change issues as a matter of urgency, stating: \u201cWe cannot be radical enough in dealing with these issues. \u201cThe question is what is practically possible. How we can take the electorate with us in dealing with these things.\u201d He said over the coming decades, \u201cgreat social unrest\u201d caused by climate change will affect \u201cwhat we eat and how we live\u201d. The natural historian compared public attitudes towards climate change to past perceptions on slavery, stating: \u201cThere was a time in the 19th century when it was perfectly acceptable for civilised human beings to think that it was morally acceptable to actually own another human being for a slave. \u201cAnd somehow or other, in the space of 20 or 30 years, the public perception of that totally transformed.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The way our homes are heated, how we travel and what we eat will be transformed, according to the government\u2019s expert advisory Committee on  Climate Change . Millions of homes will have to switch to low-carbon heating before 2030, with heat pumps, district heating networks and hydrogen boilers replacing natural gas boilers, analysis has found.  Homes could be fitted with \u201csmart\u201d systems to help control heat and power use, as well as improvements in insulation and double glazing, which would cut energy bills as well as reducing carbon emissions. Even the look of the countryside could change, with more trees and mixed  farming  replacing the monoculture landscapes of today. People will also need to eat less beef, lamb and dairy, use separate food waste collections and even switch to peat-free compost in their gardens to help cut emissions, the report from the Committee on Climate Change said. Families could also make a contribution to cutting emissions by switching short-haul flights to train journeys and reducing long-haul flights.

As it made the announcement, No 10 highlighted how the changes could help improve health, for example by cutting air pollution from transport, and boost wildlife as more woodlands are planted. David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cAchieving net zero by 2050 will change all our lives. It will transform the ways we travel, the homes we live in and the food we eat.  \u201cIt will reshape our towns, cities and countryside, delivering cleaner air and water alongside a safer climate for generations to come.\u201d The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) also pointed to the opportunity to create jobs through the shift to zero emissions, with 400,000 people already employed in the low-carbon sector and its supply chain. Beis said it was investing in clean growth to create 2 million high-quality jobs by 2030.

A final rule being issued Monday would raise mileage standards starting in the 2023 model year, reaching a projected industry-wide target of 40 miles per gallon by 2026 \u2014 25% higher than a rule finalized by the  Trump  administration last year and 5% higher than a proposal by the  Environmental Protection Agency  in August. \u201cWe are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet \u2013 and save families money at the same time,\u201d EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. Regan called the rule \u201ca giant step forward\u201d in delivering on President Joe Biden\u2019s climate agenda \u201cwhile paving the way toward an all-electric, zero-emissions transportation future.\u2033 The move comes a day after Democratic Sen.  Joe Manchin  delivered a potentially fatal blow to Biden\u2019s $2 trillion social and environmental policy bill, jeopardizing Democrats' agenda and infuriating the  White House  The West Virginia senator said he could not support the sweeping bill, which includes a host of climate proposals, saying it was too expensive and could spark inflation and expand the growing federal debt. The mileage rules set to be announced Monday are the most ambitious tailpipe pollution standards ever set for passenger cars and light trucks. The standards raise mileage goals set by the Trump administration that would achieve only 32 miles per gallon in 2026. Biden had set a goal of 38 miles per gallon in August. The standards also will help expand the market share of zero emissions vehicles, the administration said, with a goal of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles reaching 17% of new vehicles sold in 2026. EVs and plug-in hybrids are expected to have about 7% market share in 2023.

The  Aquaman  star addressed a high-level meeting concerning Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) \u2013 which include the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Haiti \u2013 at the UN\u2019s headquarters in New York.  The Hawaiian-born actor explained that he was standing before the meeting as a \u201csingular representative of all island nations\u201d, which he said were the \u201cfrontlines\u201d of the environmental crisis.  \u201cThe oceans are in a state of emergency\u201d, he warned. \u201cEntire marine ecosystems are vanishing with the warming of the seas, and as the waste of our world empties into our waters, we face the devastating crisis of plastic pollution. \u201cWe are a disease that is infecting our planet.\u201d The 40-year-old said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that there are now more plastic particles in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way. \u201cIsland nations contribute the least to this disaster, but are made to suffer the weight of its consequences,\u201d he added.  The  Game of Thrones  star implored the governments of the world and corporate powers to take immediate action to counteract the damage that has been caused to the environment. \u201cThe people will hold our governments and corporate powers accountable for the destruction you are allowing to our environment,\u201d he said.

But make no mistake \u2013 the earth doesn\u2019t need us,\u201d he said of the \u201cglobal crisis\u201d. Ending with an Island proverb highlighting the fragile nature of the earth, he said it was like a \u201ccanoe in the middle of the sea\u201d. The meeting which Momoa addressed was held five years on from the adoption of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway) by UN member states five years ago. The agreement outlined that the countries would acknowledge the \u201cneed to support and invest in these nations so they can achieve sustainable development\u201d. Following the deliverance of his speech, Momoa shared a post on Instagram in which he  described  his appearance at the event as a \u201clife-changing moment\u201d and a \u201ctrue honour\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been half assing our global efforts to reverse the climate crisis and this can\u2019t continue,\u201d he  wrote  in a second post. \u201cWe have to change now.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Areas of low oxygen known as 'dead zones' are spreading, killing or forcing marine life to flee Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The ocean is slowly being suffocated with levels of oxygen falling at a similar rate to 94 million years ago when there was a mass extinction of marine life, scientists have warned. While that event was caused naturally, humans are responsible for several different factors driving the increase in \u201c dead zones \u201d in our seas. One is that sewage and fertilisers running off farmers fields are causing massive blooms of algae that die and then decompose in a process that consumes oxygen. This kills most marine life or forces mobile animals such as fish to flee. One of the world\u2019s biggest \u201cbiological deserts\u201d is in the northern Gulf of Mexico, centred on the mouth of the Mississippi River. The Baltic Sea is also severely affected.  Another factor driving the process is that global warming is gradually increasing the amount of erosion of the land, adding extra nutrients to the sea. However this process is expected to take tens of thousands of years. The loss of oxygen from the ocean is yet another problem facing marine life along with rising temperatures and ocean acidification, caused by absorption of increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Writing in the journal  Science Advances , the researchers said that current rates of deoxygenation were similar to those 94 million years ago during what is known as Oceanic Anoxic Event-2 (OAE-2). \u201cIncreased ocean deoxygenation is already apparent in the modern ocean, because marine dioxygen has decreased by two per cent over roughly the last half century, and recent models predict a continued loss of 0.5 to 3.5 per cent over the next half century, which would result in huge expansions of ocean anoxia within the next few thousand years,\u201d they said. \u201cShould anthropogenically induced oxygen loss occur at similar rates as in the period leading up to OAE-2, then the current area of seafloor hypoxia would double in about the next 102 to 344 years. \u201cLocalised oxygen loss is already apparent in the modern ocean, and the ability to observe more widespread perturbation seems realistic under currently projected carbon emissions.

One of the researchers, Dr Sune Nielsen, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US, said: \u201cOur results show that marine deoxygenation rates prior to the ancient event were likely occurring over tens of thousands of years, and surprisingly similar to the two per cent oxygen depletion trend we\u2019re seeing induced by anthropogenic activity over the last 50 years.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the ocean is headed toward another global anoxic event, but the trend is, of course, worrying.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The goal is more ambitious than the net emissions cut of \"at least 55 per cent\" by 2030 proposed by the European Commission, which wants to finalise the target by the end of the year. To do that, Parliament will need to agree the target with EU member countries, who are split over how ambitious it should be. The EU's current 2030 goal is a 40 per cent emissions cut. Denmark and Finland on Wednesday said they were in favour of deeper emissions cuts, but Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen acknowledged it would be difficult to gather enough support for even the 55 per cent target. Parliament will rubber-stamp its position with another vote on Wednesday. Jytte Guteland, lead lawmaker on the issue, said Parliament had taken \"a big step closer\" to fulfilling the goals of the Paris climate accord. Experts say a 55 per cent cut by 2030 is the minimum needed to steer the EU towards becoming climate neutral by 2050, putting EU emissions on a path that, if adopted globally, would cap global warming at safe levels. A 60 per cent target is unlikely to secure support from EU countries. Backing a more ambitious aim could make it harder for countries to water down the target in the ensuing negotiations. \"We have decided on really ambitious instruments, and we will not easily give that away,\" said Green lawmaker Michael Bloss. Roughly half of the EU's 27 member countries have said they support an emissions cut of \"at least 55 per cent\" by 2030. Even this target will have huge implications for all sectors, with higher carbon costs for many businesses and a sharp drop in coal use.\u00a0 The Czech Republic has said it opposes the 55 per cent goal, and coal-heavy Poland wants to see more detailed economic analysis before approving any new target. That resistance could matter, since heads of government are expected to decide the member states' negotiating position at a summit in either October or December, in a process which requires unanimous support from the 27 countries.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Today\u2019s elites are out of ideas when it comes to the environment \u2013 but a new confluence of progressive actors might be able to turn the tide Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its first major report 28 years ago. This watershed document described the ominous implications of escalating emissions and the scale of the challenge in reversing this seemingly inexorable trend. Today, despite four further IPCC reports, 23 rounds of international negotiations and thousands of climate change papers and conferences, annual emissions are more than 60 per cent higher than in 1990, and are still rising. Put simply, the international community has presided over a quarter of a century of abject failure to deliver any meaningful reduction in absolute global emissions. Certainly the rhetoric of action is ramping up. Yet those who talk confidently about renewables, nuclear and \u201ccarbon capture and storage\u201d (CCS) eventually driving down emissions in decades to come are guilty of misunderstanding the fundamental science of climate change. We face a \u201ccumulative problem\u201d, with rising temperatures relating to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Based on this, the Paris 1.5C and 2C commitments demand total emissions remain within a small and rapidly dwindling \u201ccarbon budget\u201d. Time is truly of the essence. Less than 12 years of current emissions will see our 1.5C aspiration go the way of the dodo, with the 2C carbon budget exceeded by the mid 2030s. Paris defines a timeframe and scale of mobilisation reminiscent of major wars, yet our collective response remains much more akin to the apocryphal tale of a gently warming frog. Continuing with today\u2019s ineffective \u201cmitigation\u201d, delusion and fear will bequeath many humans and other species decades and even centuries of climatic instability. This preference for short-term hedonism (for the few) over longer-term planetary stewardship is essentially an active choice for politically expedient incrementalism over revolutionary change. The latter is a prerequisite of meeting our Paris commitments \u2013 but can such rapid change ever be more than a \u201cromantic illusion\u201d? An assemblage of upheaval The first two decades of this millennium have been marked by a series of deep upheavals, illustrating opportunities for rapid change, though not necessarily in a favourable direction. The banking crises exposed the internal failure of our precious free market model to both self-regulate and deliver on its central tenet: the \u201cefficient allocation of scarce resources\u201d. It also revealed how, with sufficient political will, unprecedented finances could be mobilised at the stroke of a pen. And as the bankers and economists regrouped to thwart progressive regulation, much of the power of unaccountable media barons was being seized by the amorphous twists and turns of social media. At the same time, political institutions in many parts of the world have faced serious challenges from the left, the right and \u201cunforeseen\u201d circumstances. Set against this, and despite an orchestrated campaign of denial, there is now common acceptance that responding to climate change requires significant government intervention. Rounding off this assemblage of upheaval, the plummeting cost of renewable energy has coincided with widespread recognition that relying on fossil fuels also has serious consequences for health and security. Hope from chaos? In themselves, each of the above disruptions has important implications for the evolution of contemporary society. But broadly aligned they could be guided towards something much more revolutionary \u2013 perhaps even a progressive and epoch-changing confluence of circumstances? Imagine a space where climate academics could be truly honest with policy makers about their analyses and conclusions, and where disagreements were discussed openly and constructively. Add to this, vociferous engagement by younger generations, listened to by a new breed of policy maker playing a straighter bat. Imagine then an enlightened \u201cquantitative easing\u201d transferring resources not to banks, but to mobilise a rapid transformation in energy infrastructure, retrofitting existing buildings, decarbonising transport and constructing zero-carbon power stations. A reformist political agenda could begin to emerge, facilitating secure, local and high-quality employment, eradicating fuel poverty, improving urban air quality, driving innovation and eliminating carbon emissions. Stretch the imagination a little further to embed a democratic media reporting on this transformation to an increasingly savvy and responsive audience. Under such conditions, an alternative progressive paradigm could be ushered in \u2013 and soon. Certainly, none of this looks likely, but who predicted the near-collapse of the Western banking system, the emergence of Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Jeremy Corbyn, the rise and early demise of the Arab Spring, or even the plummeting price of renewables? Most political and economic pontificators, buttressed by naysayers and established elites, remain incapable of seeing beyond their familiar 20th-century horizon. But the 21st century is already proving how the future is a different country \u2013 one that could yet be shaped by alternative interpretations of prosperity, sustainability and equity.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile I'm scared. For 15 years I've watched international progress on climate change get slower and slower, even while the pace of global warming seems to get ever more rapid. With time running out for the global climate, your meeting in Montreal represents a last chance for action. Here are a few suggestions I would urge you to consider as you gather to debate the future of the planet. BE AFRAID As the politicians dither, whole nations and ecosystems are shifting from the \"still time\" file to the \"too late\" file as vital climatic tipping points are crossed. There's now a good chance that 2005 will beat 1998 as the warmest year on record, the high temperatures undeniably giving a boost to the devastating hurricanes that battered the US coast this summer. With northern polar sea ice also declining to record lows this year, it looks too as if some kind of polar tipping point has already been crossed, making further rapid Arctic warming unstoppable. TWO DEGREES IS 'DANGEROUS' Agree first principles. The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, father to Kyoto, stated the need to avoid \"dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". No one made it clear what this might mean. Now is the time for you to agree on what constitutes \"dangerous\". In my opinion, this means raising the planet's temperature past two degrees above pre-industrial levels. In order to avoid crossing this critical threshold, you must agree to stabilise concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at 400 parts per million, giving us only a decade before time runs out. Cross the two degrees threshold, and we'll likely lose the Greenland ice sheet - flooding coastal cities across the world - as well as coral reefs, the Amazon rainforest, and many of the world's major breadbaskets, as deserts sweep across continental interiors. WE NEED GLOBAL EQUALITY Global temperatures will rocket past the two degrees limit unless rapidly developing nations such as Brazil, India and China agree to their own emissions targets, just as industrialised nations have done for Kyoto's first phase (due to end in 2012). In order to get the developing world to come to the table, rich countries' governments must offer a reasonable deal. Poor countries must be able to grow as rich countries contract towards a common goal of per capita emissions equality between nations. This is the contraction and convergence principle, surely the basic starting point for any post-2012 framework. BOYCOTT AMERICA Having refused to ratify Kyoto, America will be officially exiled to the sidelines in Montreal, giving it much less power to subvert and undermine the negotiations than has been the case in past years. But expect to see representatives from the American delegation huddled in corners with the Chinese and Indians, gently urging them not to agree to European suggestions that it is now time for developing countries to consider taking on their own post-Kyoto targets. Don't listen to them. Instead, give the Americans an ultimatum: either they agree to rejoin the Kyoto process and cut their own emissions or face ostracism from the world community. Countries that have taken on emissions cuts can't afford to see their efforts undermined by free-riders like the US, so it's time to consider economic and trade sanctions if the US won't play fair. This also goes for Australia, which follows America's lead on global warming. COMPENSATE CLIMATE VICTIMS Serious cash needs to be put aside for an adaptation fund to compensate countries and regions left uninhabitable by global warming. This will include atoll nations such as Tuvalu, soon to be flooded by sea-level rise, and drought-stricken areas such as northern China, where hundreds of thousands of people are already environmental refugees. If you had met Ye Yinxin, the only remaining inhabitant of what is now a crumbling ghost town in Gansu province, northern China, you would see the importance of this. I met Ye while researching my book High Tide. Ye's life is a solitary one of fetching brackish water for her few animals and trying to scratch a living from the sandy soil. Spending all day alone in her abandoned village, she has plenty of time to remember the better years gone by, when neighbours would gather to swap stories - before the weather changed and drought reigned supreme. Minutes after I left her one-room, mud-brick house, a terrible dust storm turned day into twilight as blood-red clouds swept overhead. There's no compensation fund to pay Ye or her displaced fellow villagers for the climatic ravages they've already suffered. Also in line for compensation will be water-stressed countries such as Peru. When I visited in 2002, I was armed with pictures of how the glaciers of the Andes had looked when my geologist father worked in them, in 1980. To my surprise and shock, entire glaciers have already disappeared, in the space of just two decades. Peru's glaciers aren't just beautiful to look at: they're crucial natural reservoirs keeping rivers running all year round to the arid Pacific coast where most of the country's population lives. Once the glaciers disappear from entire mountain ranges, millions of people face the loss of their freshwater supplies. This situation is replicated across Asia, where rivers originating in the Himalayas also face the loss of glacial-origin water. PUT YOUR OWN HOUSES IN ORDER The EU and other Kyoto-ratifying countries need to get their act together and ensure they actually meet the protocol's targets. It's no good being self-righteous about the Bush administration while doing precious little at home to cut emissions. The EU, Canada and Japan are on course to miss their targets. Margaret Beckett announced recently, without a trace of shame, that Britain wouldn't meet its self-declared target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. Then Tony Blair, the man who has done so much to put climate change on the international agenda, seemed to stab Kyoto in the back by questioning whether setting targets for greenhouse gas emissions is any longer the best way forward. And as if to emphasise our Government's moral collapse on the climate change issue, the UK is now taking the EU to court in order to force it to allow an extra 20 million tonnes of CO2 emissions from British industry. This is all the more disappointing, given that the UK has presidency of the EU at the moment and therefore leads the powerful European delegation. Unfortunately, it looks as if the tough and visionary leadership we need in Montreal may have to come from elsewhere. LISTEN TO THE PROTESTS Listen to the noise on the streets outside your tightly sealed conference centre and hotel rooms. All over the world people are mobilising to demand stronger action from governments on climate change. Rather than feeling scared and despairing about global warming, people are getting angry about the lack of progress we've seen over 15 years of lengthy negotiations. Major demonstrations are planned everywhere from Istanbul to Moscow on 3 December. In London, thousands are expected to attend a Campaign Against Climate Change march, via Downing Street to the American Embassy, making it the biggest climate change demonstration ever on British soil. The marchers will demand leadership from the politicians on what is increasingly acknowledged as being a survival challenge to the entire human species. The protesters will want to see action. Now is the time to deliver.

Speaking to world leaders at the  United Nations  in New York, the prime minister will say that mankind has behaved like a reckless teenager with planet Earth, trashing its home in the \u201cinfantile\u201d belief that it will not have to suffer the consequences. And he will say that the UN  Cop26  climate change summit which the UK will host in Glasgow in November must be \u201cthe turning point for humanity\u201d, when the world must show it can limit temperature rises and prevent the planet becoming uninhabitable. A day after US president  Joe Biden  pledged to double America\u2019s contribution to a $100bn (\u00a373bn) climate finance fund for developing countries, Mr Johnson will boost\u00a0the UK\u2019s share to \u00a311.6bn by increasing the share of overseas investment which goes towards global warming projects. And the UK welcomed an announcement from China that it will step up its support for poorer nations developing low-carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power plants abroad. Mr Johnson thanked the president in person for the new US pledge when the pair met for talks in the White House on Tuesday, telling Biden it was \u201cfantastic to see the United States really stepping up and showing a real lead\u201d. He presented the president a signed copy of astronaut Tim Peake\u2019s plea for preservation of the Earth\u2019s natural beauties Hello, Is this Planet Earth? Mr Biden repeated his assurance that he will be among more than 100 world leaders attending the Glasgow gathering, saying the US will be present \u201cwith bells on\u201d. But he poured cold water on the PM\u2019s hopes for a UK\/US trade deal, saying only that the subject would be discussed \u201ca little bit\u201d in their talks in the Oval Office. The meeting came as it emerged that the UK is considering a bid to join a North American free trade pact with the US, Mexico and Canada. And he once again warned Johnson not to allow Brexit to lead to a hard border in Ireland, telling him: I would not at all like to see - nor, I might add, would many of my Republican colleagues like to see - a change in the Irish accords, with the end result of having a closed border in Ireland.\u201d In his speech on Wednedsday, the PM will tell the UN that humanity is at a turning point, where it can no longer take the health of the planet for granted but instead needs to take urgent action to halt climate change. But he will insist that this is not incompatible with economic prosperity, arguing that clean and green energy will deliver the growth of the future. Mr Johnson\u2019s speech comes a day after talks with Mr Biden at the White House, when the pair agreed to continue pressing the rich world to fill the remaining $15bn gap in the climate finance fund in time for the crucial Cop26 summit. Despite Washington\u2019s failure to consult London over its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan or its decision to lift coronavirus travel restrictions, Mr Johnson insisted that UK-US relations were in \u201cfantastic\u201d shape. But he was forced to backtrack after risking a spat with the president by suggesting the Afghan pullout was badly handled. Speaking on breakfast TV, the prime minister hinted at dissatisfaction with the US approach, saying: \u201cCould we have done it a bit differently? Maybe we could.\u201d But meeting vice-president Kamala Harris later at the White House, he restricted himself to praising the \u201cbrave\u201d US troops who facilitated the evacuation from Kabul airport. Ahead of the UN address, the PM revealed that the UK was putting \u00a3100m from its biodiverse landscapes fund into six of the world\u2019s most important wildlife hotspots, including the Congo Basin, the Lower Mekong and the Kavango-Zambezi region, and was inviting some of the UK\u2019s most polluting businesses to bid for a share of a \u00a3220m pot of money to help find new ways to reduce their carbon emissions. Speaking to the general assembly, Mr Johnson will say that fossil records show that mammalian species typically exist for around 1 million years before evolving into something else or becoming extinct. At 200,000 years old, mankind is roughly one-fifth of the way through this expected lifespan \u2013 the equivalent of reaching its late teens \u2013 he will say. And he will tell his audience of world leaders and diplomats: \u201cWe have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal. \u201cIn the words of the Oxford philosopher Toby Ord: \u2018We are just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble.\u2019\u201d PA PA AFP via Getty PA AFP\/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP\/Getty PA Reuters PA AP SWNS PA Getty PA PA PA PA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP\/Getty PA PA PA PA PA PA PA AFP via Getty Images UK PARLIAMENT\/AFP via Getty Images PA PA AP PA EPA PA PA PA Reuters PA PA EPA PA Humanity\u2019s teenage sensibility allows it to cling onto \u201cthe infantile belief that the world was made for our gratification and pleasure\u201d, the prime minister will say, adding: \u201cWe combine this narcissism with a primitive assumption of our own immortality. \u201cWe believe that someone else will clear up the mess we make, because that is what someone else has always done. We trash our habitats again and again with the inductive reasoning that we have got away with it so far, and therefore we will get away with it again.\u201d But he will warn that humanity\u2019s adolescence is now coming to an end, and that the Cop26 summit will mark the \u201ccritical turning point\u2026 when we must show that we are capable of learning and maturing and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are doing \u2013 not just to our planet but to ourselves\u201d. He will say: \u201cIt is time for humanity to grow up. It is time for us to listen to the warnings of the scientists \u2013 and look at Covid, if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right \u2013 and to understand who we are and what we are doing. \u201cThe world \u2013 this precious blue sphere with its eggshell crust and wisp of an atmosphere \u2013 is not some indestructible toy, some bouncy plastic romper room against which we can hurl ourselves to our heart\u2019s content. \u201cDaily, weekly, we are doing such irreversible damage that long before a million years are up we will have made this beautiful planet effectively uninhabitable \u2013 not just for us but for many other species. \u201cAnd that is why the Glasgow Cop26 summit is the turning point for humanity. We must limit the rise in temperatures \u2013 whose appalling effects were visible even this summer \u2013 to 1.5 degrees. \u201cWe must come together in a collective coming of age. We must show we have the maturity and wisdom to act. And we can.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The  Argentine  research station Esperanza, which collected the data, said the figure beat the previous record of 17.5C in March 2015 by 0.8C. It comes after the world saw the warmest January on record last month, according to the  EU \u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with temperatures in Europe 0.2C higher than during the previous warmest January in 2007. A committee for the  United Nations \u2019  World Meteorological Organisation  (WMO) will now work to verify whether the new record for the continent is correct. \u201cEverything we have seen thus far indicates a likely legitimate record but we will of course begin a formal evaluation of the record once we have full data from SMN and on the meteorological conditions surrounding the event,\u201d Randy Cerveny, WMO\u2019s Weather and Climate Extremes rapporteur, said. Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty \u201cThe record appears to be likely associated (in the short term) with what we call a regional \u2018foehn\u2019 event over the area: a rapid warming of air coming down a slope\/mountain,\u201d Mr Cerveny added. The Antarctic peninsula, the northwest tip near South America, is among the fastest warming regions on Earth, with temperatures rising almost 3C over the past 50 years, according to the WMO. The organisation added that about 87 per cent of the glaciers along the peninsula\u2019s west coast have \u201cretreated\u201d over the last 50 years, with most showing an \u201caccelerated retreat\u201d in the last 12 years. On Thursday, a major hole was discovered in the  Thwaites Glacier , which could send sea levels surging by up to two feet if it dissolved completely. Scientists have found a cavity beneath the glacier that is far larger than previously thought. \u201cThe size of the cavity is surprising, and, as it melts, it\u2019s causing the glacier to retreat,\u201d Pietro Milillo, a  Nasa  radar scientist who led the research into the glacier, said. The Esperanza research base, located near the northern tip of the peninsula, has been collecting data since 1961. The reading breaks the 2015 record for the Antarctic continent, which is defined as the main continental landmass and adjoining islands by the WMO. The record for the Antarctic region, which is defined as all land and ice south of 60 degrees latitude, is a temperature of 19.8C recorded on Signy Island in January 1982, the WMO said.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in As the ice recedes from climate change, historical marvels and natural phenomena have come to light  Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The rapid melting of ice from\u00a0 glaciers \u00a0and landmasses such as\u00a0 Greenland \u00a0and\u00a0 Antarctica \u00a0has terrifying implications for the future of the planet. Just this week it was revealed that  glaciers \u00a0in the\u00a0 Himalayas \u00a0are shrinking far more rapidly than glaciers in other parts of the world, threatening the\u00a0 water supply \u00a0of millions of people in Asia. This loss of ice globally is even causing the  Earth\u2019s crust to warp . A side effect of this situation is the artefacts and scientific discoveries unveiled by the receding ice. First World War cave shelter and trove of artefacts A melted\u00a0 glacier \u00a0in Northern Italy uncovered a trove of  World War One treasures  in May. A\u00a0 cave \u00a0shelter in Mount Scorluzzo housed 20 Austrian\u00a0 soldiers \u00a0in the war, and has now revealed food, dishes, jackets, and other items. The cave was first entered by\u00a0 researchers \u00a0in 2017, when the surrounding glacier had melted, historian Stefano Morosini told\u00a0 CNN . A total of 300 objects were found as a result of the melt, with straw mattresses, coins, helmets, ammunition, bottles, tins, and even newspapers. Viruses over 15,000 years old found in Tibet In August we reported on the discovery of 28 new\u00a0 viruses \u00a0believed to be 15,000-years-old surviving inside\u00a0 glaciers . The viruses, which are unlike those known to science, were found in ice samples drilled from the Guliya ice cap in the Tibetan Plateau, in western China. The\u00a0 scientists \u00a0identified 33 viral genomes in total, and at least 28 of them are novel, they said. Four of the known viruses have been found to infect\u00a0 bacteria . The novel viruses are not believed to be harmful to humans, according to the scientists who hope that the viruses can help them understand more about virus evolution and climate change. The Tibetan plateau, sometimes known as the world\u2019s \u201cthird pole\u201d, has lost nearly a quarter of its ice since 1970, due to the\u00a0 climate crisis ,\u00a0 according to the IPCC . Mammoths and rhinoceros bones in Russia A carcass of a juvenile woolly rhinoceros, found in permafrost in August 2020 on the banks of the Tirekhtyakh river in the region of Yakutia in eastern Siberia, Russia Melting ice within\u00a0 permafrost \u00a0in the Russian\u00a0 arctic  revealed ancient life that has been  buried there for thousands of years . An investigation by\u00a0 Sky News  into the environmental damage caused by the thawing of this region\u2019s vast carbon stores found parts of mammoth tusk as well as fragments of woolly rhinoceros bone. The animals once roamed the Arctic grasslands before becoming extinct: rhinos around 14,000 to 15,000 years ago and mammoths about 10,500 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. The bone and tusk fragments were found in Duvanny Yar, near Chersky in the Siberian Arctic \u2013 home to international research stations where scientists congregate to study the impact of the retreating ice. Radioactive waste in Arctic The rapid thaw of Arctic permafrost could release radioactive waste from Cold War nuclear submarines, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and new viruses, a report has found. Between 1955 and 1990, the Soviet Union conducted 130 nuclear weapons tests on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago off the coast of northwest Russia. The tests released around 265 megatons of\u00a0 nuclear energy \u00a0and more than 100 decommissioned nuclear submarines were scuttled in the nearby Kara and Barents seas. The United States\u2019 Camp Century nuclear-powered under-ice research facility in Greenland also produced \u201cconsiderable nuclear and diesel waste\u201d. Meanwhile, deep permafrost of more than three metres is one of the few environments on Earth that has not been exposed to modern\u00a0 antibiotics . More than 100 diverse microorganisms in Siberian deep permafrost have been found to be antibiotic-resistant, and as permafrost thaws, there is potential for these bacteria to mix with meltwater and create new antibiotic-resistant strains of existing bacteria. This article was amended on 4 January 2022. It previously stated incorrectly that frozen bacteria could mix with meltwater and \u2018create new antibiotic-resistant strains of existing viruses\u2019, but it should have said of \u2018new antibiotic-resistant strains of existing bacteria\u2019.

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The United Nations Summit on Biodiversity convened on Wednesday with global leaders vowing to do more to protect nature following a devastating report which showed the world is failing to hit all targets to halt biodiversity collapse. It lent an added urgency to the summit which had originally been due to take place this month in Kunming, China, but was delayed to 2021 due the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of Covid-19, a zoonotic virus which jumped from an animal to human, added another dimension this year, illustrating the potential risks to humanity if we continue on a destructive path through the natural world.\u00a0 \u201cWe are reminded that when we destroy and degrade biodiversity, we undermine the web of life and increase the risk of disease spillover from wildlife to people,\u201d the UN stated. \"Responses to the pandemic provide a unique opportunity for transformative change as a global community. An investment in the health of our planet is an investment in our own future.\" The Independent\u2019s  Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which was launched earlier this year, seeks an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals which frequently occurs in some of the world\u2019s richest biodiversity hotspots. Earlier this month, the UN\u2019s  Global Biodiversity Outlook 5\u00a0  revealed the world had mostly failed to meet targets from previous talks intended to prevent more species from vanishing and to safeguard ecosystems. Here are some key takeaways from Wednesday\u2019s summit: UN Secretary-General says \u2018humanity is waging a war on nature\u2019 UN chief Antonio Guterres opened the summit on Wednesday with figures on the perilous state of the natural world.\u00a0 More than a million species were at risk of extinction, he said, adding that: 'More than 60 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs are endangered due to overfishing, destructive practices and climate change.\" He pointed to humanity\u2019s place in nature\u2019s \u201cfragile web\u201d adding that one consequence of our imbalance was the \"emergence of deadly diseases such as HIV-AIDS, Ebola, and now COVID-19, against which we have little or no defence\".\u00a0 \u201cHumanity is waging war on nature, we need to change our relationship with it,\u201d the Secretary-General said. Chinese President Xi Jinping urges cooperation but no surprise announcement like on climate The Chinese leader called for international cooperation to protect biodiversity but made no major environmental commitment. It had been suggested that Xi might blindside fellow leaders again following his surprise announcement last week that China aimed to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and have emissions peak before the end of the decade. \u00a0 \"The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of the ecosystem pose a major risk to human survival and development,\" Xi said. \u201cCovid-19 reminds us of the interdependence between man and nature. It falls to all of us to act together and urgently to advance protection and development in parallel.\u201d He also defended the Paris Climate Agreement, an apparent dig at President Trump who intends to pull out of the deal if he is re-elected in November. Brazilian president comes out swinging over \u2018international greed\u2019 in the Amazon Brazil\u2019s right-wing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has long been defensive of his record in the Amazon, where fires are at the  highest level  in a decade. Today he lashed out at global concern that the Amazon rainforest is rapidly being destroyed by fires and industry. \"I strongly reject international greed towards our coveted Amazon,\" he said . \"We shall defend it against actions and narratives that may prove harmful to our national interests.\" Environmental advocates and scientists say that Mr Bolsonaro is to blame for weakening environmental protections and calling for the development of the Amazon. But he criticized \u201cunfair\u201d international rules and said that Brazil had the right to use its natural resources.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources in the Brazilian territory,\u201d he said. Indigenous leader warns the plan to protect 30% by 2030 could be \u2018biggest land grab in history\u2019 Dozens of countries have signed  a global pledge  to protect 30 per cent of land and seas by 2030 in a bid to halt biodiversity loss but an indigenous activist from India warned the summit that it could be the \u201cbiggest land grab in history\u201d. \u00a0Archana Soreng, who is part of the UN\u2019s youth advisory group on climate change and a member of the Khadia tribe, said: \"We should be the leaders of conservation, not the victims of it.\" She urged global leaders to tread carefully when implementing protections that could result in human rights abuses if people were taken from their lands to protect nature, a move which she said would be \u201cdeeply colonial and environmentally damaging\u201d. David Attenborough calls for $500bn a year to protect nature On the day of the summit, Sir David Attenborough announced a conservation campaign asking the world to invest half a trillion each year to halt the destruction of natural world. The veteran broadcaster, 94, said: \u201cOur natural world is under greater pressure now than at any time in human history, and the future of the entire planet \u2013 on which every single one of us depends \u2013 is in grave jeopardy.\u201d\u00a0 He added: \u201cWe still have an opportunity to reverse catastrophic biodiversity loss, but time is running out.\u201d The campaign was launched by environmental group  Fauna & Flora International, \u00a0 and backed by more than 130 organisations. The goal is to pivot financing from fossil fuels and polluters into locally-led conservation. The \u201cOur One Home\u201d campaign is \u201ccalling on global governments to commit an initial $500 billion to protect nature, with that amount increasing every year\u201d.\u00a0 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

It is the third severe  coral bleaching  event for  Australia \u2019s iconic reef in just five years. Corals along the entire 1,400-mile stretch have been severely affected, according to surveys by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and James Cook University in Australia. The bleaching has been caused solely by a summer of extreme heat, unlike in past years when El Ni\u00f1os \u2014 weather patterns caused by warming of the Pacific Ocean close to the Equator \u2014 contributed to the conditions. It is a troubling indicator that climate change caused by human activity is the main factor behind coral reef bleaching. \u201cWe surveyed 1,036 reefs from the air during the last two weeks in March, to measure the extent and severity of coral bleaching throughout the Barrier Reef region,\u201d said Professor Terry Hughes, director of the  ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies  at the university.  \u201cFor the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors.\u201d When sea temperatures spike, corals expel the marine algae, called zooxanthellae, which live inside their tissues, giving them vibrant colours and food supply via photosynthesis. Expelling the algae is what turns the coral white and without a food supply they can starve, according to  Marine Conservation . The first recorded mass bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef was in 1998, then the hottest year on record. Since then, four more bleaching events have occurred, in 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020, as the temperature records continue to be broken. As the gap between bleaching events shrinks, it prevents the coral from making a full recovery. February 2020 hit a record high temperature for that month in the Great Barrier Reef. Mark Eakin, coordinator for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Coral Reef Watch  program, described the rate of return of these events as \u201ctruly disturbing\u201d. In an email, he told  The Independent : \u201cIn 2016 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef had their first back-to-back bleaching events. Now we have the third bleaching event in five years. That is unprecedented on the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cHowever, the most troubling is that this bleaching event happened without any tropical forcing. \u201cIn 2016, an El Ni\u00f1o was underway after an almost-El Ni\u00f1o the year before. In 2017, an El Ni\u00f1o had just ended and we had move straight past neutral conditions to a La Ni\u00f1a. Both of these have impacts on heat in the tropical Pacific Ocean, changing the normal patterns. \u201cIn 2020, there were neutral conditions with no strong El Ni\u00f1o last year. It\u2019s now clear that we can have major bleaching events caused by global climate change alone with no tropical forcing.\u201d On 2 April, Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the  Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority , gave an update on reef health after aerial surveys were done on more than 1,000 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef.  Dr Wachenfeld said that in the south, they found reefs that had bleached severely for the first time this year compared to 2016. He said that bleached coral is \u201cstressed\u201d and \u201cstarving\u201d but it is not dead. On reefs where the bleaching was negligible or moderate, he said that it was likely that many of those corals would survive which was essential for their future recovery. On the reefs that were more severely bleached, there would likely be higher levels of coral death but it was still variable, he said. The researchers will continue to assess the coral damage throughout the year.

The rise in global temperatures has seen the European wine industry enjoy a boom in recent years with better quality grapes being harvested but it will not last forever.  In western Europe, the best wines are produced in hot summers when end-of-season droughts are followed by heavy spring rains.  Indian summers reduce surface moisture and dry out the soil which makes the grapes ready for harvest.  As temperatures rise the soil dries out quicker and wine growers do not need droughts as much. But climate change is also causing harvest time to be pushed further and further back as hot spells last longer and longer. This means crops are more likely to die or be damaged. The study by scientists at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory  and the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies found that from 1980 onwards, the harvest was an average of two weeks later in France compared to the 400-year average.  Professor Elizabeth Wolkovich, an ecologist at Harvard University, said the switch had not harmed the wine industry yet but it was only a matter of time.  She said \"so far, a good year is a hot year\u201d but noted that the hottest year on record in France, 2003, led to the grapes being picked a full month earlier than usual yet they were not a particularly good vintage.  \"That may be a good indicator of where we're headed\" she said, \"If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can't maintain that forever\". If the trend continues, wine production will be forced to move other parts of the world with famous wine growing regions like France and California being replaced by China or Canada. EPA EPA Reuters AP Reuters Reuters Reuters Getty Images  EPA   EPA EPA EPA EPA EPA Liz Thach, a professor of management and wine business at Sonoma State University in California, said the study confirmed what growers already knew.  She said: \"Some people may still be skeptical about global warming, but not anyone in the wine industry.  \"Everyone believes it, because everyone sees it year by year\u2014it's here, it's real, it's not going away.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Appearing on  the CNBC TV show  Squawk Box , Mr Pruitt, a lawyer, was asked if he thought it had been proven that carbon dioxide was the \u201cprimary control knob for climate\u201d. While the biggest input to the Earth\u2019s temperature is obviously the sun, rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have been increasing the atmosphere\u2019s ability to trap its heat and this is the main reason why temperatures have risen by about one degree Celsius since the late 19th century. Nasa, the UK Met Office and ever single major scientific body worldwide agrees this is true. The process by which carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas has been understood for more than a century and can be demonstrated by a simple experiment. However Mr Pruitt, chosen by Donald Trump to run an agency he made a career out of repeatedly suing as the attorney-general of Oklahoma, told CNBC: \u201cI think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. \u201cBut we don't know that yet as far as ... we need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.\u201d A common tactic used by climate science deniers is to try to exploit the language and nature of science to suggest global warming is simply 'a theory' and that there is still 'debate' about the issue. It may be that Mr Pruitt was attempting to follow this line but inadvertently over-stepped into outright denial of accepted science. Rush Holt, the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has compared  denying climate science to disputing the theory of gravity . And even Lord Lawson's climate sceptic think tank in the UK, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, accepts carbon emissions have  caused the Earth's average temperature to rise . Asked by  The Independent  to comment on Mr Pruitt's remarks, climatologist Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, wrote: \"I'm on record (as is Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, [US] National Academies, [UK] Royal Society etc) as saying that all recent warming is essentially anthropogenic and the dominant factor is carbon dioxide.\" This essentially restates the message of  a joint statement issued by Nasa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  in January. It said the latest figures showed Earth\u2019s average surface temperature had risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. The UK Met Office produced similar figures based on different measurements at around the same time. This was, the Nasa\/NOAA statement said, \u201ca change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere\u201d. \u201cMost of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001,\u201d the statement added. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan \u201cNot only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year \u2013 from January through September, with the exception of June \u2013 were the warmest on record for those respective months.  \u201cOctober, November, and December of 2016 were the second warmest of those months on record \u2013 in all three cases, behind records set in 2015.\u201d Not all of the temperature rise was attributed to greenhouse gases resulting from human activity. Researchers estimated that the natural El Ni\u00f1o effect in the tropical Pacific had accounted for about 0.12C of the 1.1C rise.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in World Meteorological Society chief warns dwindling water supplies is\u00a0greatest\u00a0of all dangers posed by climate change Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile The world is facing a future of food shortages and mass migration as a consequence of widespread water shortages caused by global warming, the outgoing head of the World Meteorological Society has warned. Michel Jarraud, the WMO\u2019s Secretary-General, said of all the dangers posed by climate change \u2013 from increasingly intense storms and a growth in disease to rising sea levels that may submerge cities \u2013 the greatest threat is from dwindling water supplies. About 1.6 billion people already live in areas that are classed as having \u201cwater scarcity\u201d and that number is forecast to reach 2.8 billion by 2025. It will go on climbing after that as the planet continues warming. Large swathes of Africa, the Middle East and Asia will be hit hardest, although parts of Australia, the US, South America and southern Europe are also vulnerable. Experts predict the scarcity will unleash a major refugee crisis as the lack of water for drinking, crops and manufacturing makes huge populated areas uninhabitable and hundreds of millions of people are forced to move. \u201cOften we think about climate change in terms of temperature but actually the most important parameter which will be affected is the water cycle,\u201d Mr Jarraud told the Carbon Brief website. \u201cIn a water-stressed area, there will be even more stress on the water resources.\u201d  The world\u2019s rising population will also exacerbate the problem as it continues to stretch increasingly meagre water supplies. The population is due to soar from 7.3 billion people today to 11.2 billion by the end of the century \u2013 with much of the growth due to come from Africa, a continent where many areas are already hot, poor and short of water, according to UN forecasts. There is evidence that the world\u2019s water resources are already coming under intolerable pressure. Earlier this year the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, home to 20 million people and once known as the City of Drizzle, was hit with such a bad drought that residents began drilling through basement floors and car parks to try to reach groundwater. In California, Governor Jerry Brown introduced a drought mandate requiring cities to cut water use by as much as 36 per cent or face fines. And in Middle-Eastern countries such as Iran, swathes of countryside have been reduced to desert because too much water is being used. Global warming will put further pressure on water supplies by upsetting established weather patterns, leading to less rainfall in some areas and drying out groundwater supplies, Mr Jarraud says. \u201cWith climate change coming, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will increase and the frequency and intensity of droughts in some parts of the world will increase,\u201d he said, adding that health and food shortages were among the other serious threats posed by global warming. \u201cSome diseases will expand in areas that they don\u2019t exist now because of climate change\u2026 A few years ago there were some major food crises. Right now, for the last few years there have been hotspots here and there. However, all the ingredients are there for a food crisis to come back on a very large scale,\u201d said Mr Jarraud, who will step down from the WMO at the end of the year after the maximum term of 12 years in the post. He will continue as an advisor. Mr Jarraud said he welcomed the Paris Agreement this month in which world leaders agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5C and 2C \u2013 although he stressed that meeting that target would not be easy. \u201cIt is still possible to stay under 2C but it requires bold and ambitious action,\u201d he said, adding that he was cautiously optimistic about the prospect for tackling climate change following the agreement.

Last year was the hottest year on record for  Europe  after scorching heatwaves led to record-breaking temperatures in February, June and July, scientists from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (CS3) said in the annual European State of the Climate report.  \u201cThe number of days with high heat stress levels are increasing in both northern and southern Europe,\u201d they said.  The findings highlight a continuing trend of warming over four decades in Europe which the Copernicus scientists say is being caused by rising greenhouse gases.  \u201cThese record-breaking events are not a surprise. With the climate warming all time, we are bound to see a disproportionate number of record-breaking [hot] years and relatively fewer extremely cold events,\u201d Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus climate service, told  The Independent . \u201cThe latest data for all global climate indicators show values in line with the trends of recent decades, with  greenhouse gases  continuing to increase, while glaciers and ice sheets are losing mass, further contributing to sea level rise,\u201d he said.  An intense heatwave at the end of July led to record melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and all-time records being broken in northern Scandinavia, the Copernicus report noted.  According to recent research, Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and the polar ice caps are melting six times faster than they were in the 1990s. The high melt rate fits with the worst-case scenario outlined by the  UN \u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which states that sea levels will rise 17cm without sweeping reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  \u201cEurope\u2019s climate is often tied to conditions in the Arctic, and changes there can have a huge impact on our lives,\u201d according to Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the centre for polar observation at the University of Leeds.  \u201cWe can\u2019t avoid the rapid changes in climate that are happening around our planet, even if they occur miles away in the polar regions, because they affect our weather today and will affect our coastlines in the future,\u201d he said.  Concentrations of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere continue to increase. \u201cIt is only possible to find concentrations as high as they were in 2019 by going back millions of years in history,\u201d the Copernicus scientists said.  Professor Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, told  The Independent  that the current level of CO2 in the atmosphere is \u201cunnaturally high\u201d.  He said it should be 280 parts per million (ppm) but is currently 415ppm and could reach 1000ppm by the end of the century if CO2 emissions continue to rise at their current rate.  \u201cThe last time the CO2 was this high was during the Pliocene, [around] 4 million years ago. Then temperatures were 3-4C warmer than now and sea level was 20-30m higher,\u201d he said.  Global temperatures have risen around 1.1C above the pre-industrial era over the last five years. In Europe they have increased almost 2C, according to Copernicus.  UN scientists say that global emissions need to be cut by at least 7.6 per cent each year until 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C, the crucial threshold which will precipitate the risk of extreme weather events and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. \u201cWe must act to reduce our global emissions to zero in the next 30 years if we are to keep the planet in a condition that supports our society,\u201d Siegert said.

Last month was \u00a00.05C (0.09F) warmer globally than September 2019, and 0.08C (0.14F) warmer than September 2016, previously the warmest and second-warmest for the month. Temperatures were unusually high in a number of regions including in northern Siberia, the Middle East and parts of South America and Australia. \u00a0Arctic sea ice also shrank to its second-lowest extent since satellite records began, according to scientists with the  Copernicus  Climate Change Service (C3S).   Across Europe, September average temperatures were around 0.2C \u00a0(0.36F) warmer than the previous warmest September in 2018.\u00a0 The research team also revealed that 2020 looks set to match, or even surpass, 2016, which is the warmest calendar year ever. Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) announced the arrival of a La Ni\u00f1a event, which alters atmospheric circulation over the Pacific Ocean, and will impact whether this year ends up being the warmest on record. La Ni\u00f1a can lead to more rain than average through Indonesia, cooler and wetter weather in southern Africa, and drier weather in southeastern China, NOAA reported. The monthly Copernicus report found cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific, consistent with the La Ni\u00f1a. The Siberian Arctic has been experiencing hotter than average temperatures over the past six months. While the region is known for big swings in temperature year on year, the heat has been \"unusual in its magnitude and persistence\", C3S noted. Arctic sea ice extent last month has also declined to the second lowest amount ever recorded, following September 2012.\u00a0 Sea ice extent in the polar region has been dramatically declining since the first satellite observations in the late Seventies. The trend is visible all year round but it most marked in September, when ice cover is at its annual minimum.

Extreme weather events like hurricanes and  wildfires  are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change and in turn, release carcinogens into the atmosphere.  Hurricane Harvey battered Louisiana and Texas in 2017 with devastating impacts felt along the Gulf Coast and in the city of Houston. The category-4 storm inundated chemical plants,  oil  refineries, and Superfund sites that contained vast amounts of carcinogens that were released into the Houston community, the researchers found. In 2018, an investigation by the  Associated Pres s and Houston Chronicle found more than 100 toxic releases into surrounding communities related to Hurricane Harvey, on land, in water and in the air.  The increase of patients' exposure to carcinogens was compounded by the fact that the hurricane conditions made it difficult for patients to seek preventative care and treatment while also threatening the lab and clinical infrastructure that supports cancer care.  The study was published today in  CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians  by researchers from the American Cancer Society and Harvard University. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death for Americans. Wildfires are another risk. Global warming has led to longer wildfire seasons in the US that have spread over greater areas. Widespread burning releases vast amounts of air pollutants that are known to cause cancer, the study notes.  Lung cancer is associated with long-term exposure to particle pollution and wood-fire smoke but few studies have been conducted. It\u2019s unclear how short-term exposure to such smoke will affect people,  AP  reported.\u200b Tackling climate change will have both environmental and health benefits. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not only be good for the planet but will reduce air pollutants emitted from combustion processes that are harmful to health, the study noted.  Another proposal for tackling cancer is diet. The  Mayo Clinic  estimates that around a third of cancer cases could be prevented by switching from animal sources to a plant-based diet.  The agricultural sector is the source of one-third of greenhouse gas emissions with cattle as the main agricultural source of  greenhouse gases  worldwide, according to  UC Davis .  The authors of the new study wrote: \"While some may view these issues as beyond the scope of responsibility of the nation's cancer treatment facilities, one need look no further than their mission statements, all of which speak to eradicating cancer. \"Climate change and continued reliance on fossil fuels push that noble goal further from reach. \"However, if all those whose life work is to care for those with cancer made clear to the communities they serve that actions to combat climate change and lessen our use of fossil fuels could prevent cancers and improve cancer outcomes, we might see actions that address climate change flourish, and the attainment of our missions to reduce suffering from cancer grow nearer.\"\u200b   Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

One idea is to fertilise the ocean with iron in order to stimulate algae blooms that absorb  carbon dioxide  from the sea and also the atmosphere. This form of  geoengineering  was first explored back in the 1990s, but now Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the government, is encouraging experts to seriously look at it again.  The Cambridge University professor believes iron aerosols could be dropped into the ocean causing great forests to develop \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. He told  The Times : \u201cIf we look at the shallow oceans, in coastal regions, many used to be very rich in seaweed and kelp... Regreening those areas to encourage seaweed and kelp back is a relatively simple matter, and technically feasible at low cost\u201d.  AFP\/Getty Getty\/iStock AFP\/Gett Getty H Goehlich Getty\/Lumix Getty\/iStock AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Nature Seychelles AFP\/Getty C Reveret AFP\/Getty Getty\/Tourism Queensland AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty\/Lumix AFP\/Getty Sarah Frias-Torres  AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty More controversially, Sir David believes iron could also be used in the deep ocean to stimulate phytoplankton. This could be a way of boosting a natural carbon \u201csink\u201d because algal blooms convert sunlight into chemical energy using carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. According to research by the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, iron-rich regions have between two and three times as much carbon sequestered in seafloor sediments. These sediments would have built up over thousands of years as algal blooms die and sink to the ocean floor, taking their carbon with them. Sir David, who is set to discuss the idea at the Royal Institution on Thursday evening, believes algal blooms could also increase fish stocks.  \u201cWithin a relatively short time we can be confident billions of fish will be feeding off this, and repopulating of the oceans occurs,\u201d he said.  However, other scientists believe the ambitious plan has serious shortcomings. Professor Andrew Watson from the University of Exeter worked on the original studies on this topic back in the 1990s. He told  The Independent  there were still \u201cpoorly known downside risks\u201d to fertilising the oceans.  \u201cWhile it is true that carbon dioxide could be removed from the atmosphere by iron fertilization of some regions of the ocean \u2013 the Southern Ocean for instance - to do this at a scale that would really make a contribution to slowing global warming would entail changing the ecology of large ocean regions,\u201d he said.  Professor Watson believes that one potential downside is reducing oxygen in the subsurface of the ocean, which could lead to the production of other greenhouse gases.  \u201cMuch more research is needed therefore, before any attempt to try iron fertilisation at such a scale. There is no way that iron fertilisation can substitute for the first line of action against climate change, which is to reduce our emissions,\u201d he said.  Dr Christian Maerz, associate professor in Biogeochemistry at the University of Leeds said the main problem with iron fertilisation is that not much of the dead algal biomass makes it down to the seafloor.  Dr Maerz told  The Independent : \"Most of them get degraded within the top 100 metres of the ocean, eaten up by microbes, and most of the sequestered carbon dioxide gets returned to the atmosphere. And even at the seafloor, degradation processes continue.  \"So the main issue with iron fertilisation seems to be \u2013 leaving aside the potentially fundamental but poorly constrained impacts that this activity has on the ecosystem \u2013 that not much of the sequestered carbon dioxide actually makes it into the seafloor.\" Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

A \u201cdevastating\u201d new UN report is expected to set out a stark message on runaway  climate change  in what the government hope will be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report, published on Monday, will be the first comprehensive assessment of scientific knowledge about the threat to the planet from human activity since 2013. IPCC report - live: Latest reactions as UN report to warn time running out to save planet An interim report said global warming was likely to hit 1.5C, the disastrous limit world leaders have pledged to try to avoid, between 2030 and 2052. But reports indicate that a new landmark study will bring the window forward by a decade to 2040 at the latest. Boris Johnson \u2019s government said it hoped the report would prove to be a decisive \u201cwake-up call\u201d for countries to do more to tackle the climate crisis, as the UK prepares to host the crucial  Cop26  climate summit in Glasgow in November. Climate minister and Cop26 president Alok Sharma said he expected the report to act as \u201ca big wake-up call for countries to do even more\u201d, he said on Sunday. \u201cI suspect the IPCC will reinforce the fact that we are running out of time. It will genuinely be a decisive moment in history.\u201d However, Labour and opposition leaders claimed Downing Street was in disarray over the UK\u2019s plans to deal with the climate emergency \u2013 accusing the government of \u201cdragging its feet\u201d over a fully costed plan to cut carbon emissions. The Treasury\u2019s review into the cost of achieving a government target of \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050 is said to have been delayed over concerns the plan could cost the Conservative Party votes. Chancellor  Rishi Sunak  is increasingly concerned\u00a0about the cost to the taxpayer in subsiding green technologies. \u201cWe are in the decisive decade in our fight to avert catastrophic climate breakdown and we desperately need serious leadership,\u201d said Luke Pollard MP, shadow environment secretary. \u201cInstead, we have a prime minister who is more interested in vacuous boosterism than the hard yards of policy work \u2026 and a chancellor who is dragging his feet on publishing the crucial net-zero review.\u201d Green MP Caroline Lucas told  The Independent  it was time for the government to act with a greater sense of urgency. \u201cThe government\u2019s continued delay in publishing its net zero review is a damning indictment of ministers\u2019 complacency over tackling the climate emergency,\u201d she said. Urging the government to ignore Tory MPs worried about the costs to the taxpayer, Ms Lucas added: \u201cSuggestions that the delay is caused by Treasury fears that it could cost the Tory Party votes further undermine any claim the government might make to leadership on this issue.\u201d The government was also condemned for failing to rule out new fossil fuel extraction licences, allowing new oil and gas projects in the North Sea and a new coal mine in Cumbria. Mr Sharma\u00a0refused to criticise plans for further fossil fuel extraction, telling\u00a0 The Observer : \u201cFuture [fossil fuel] licences are going to have to adhere to the fact we have committed to go to net zero by 2050 in legislation.\u201d Friends of the Earth international climate campaigner Rachel Kennerley said the UK\u2019s message to other countries at Cop26 \u201cwill be severely undermined unless the government clearly rules out new climate-wrecking oil projects, like the Cambo oil field off the Shetland Islands\u201d. The Independent \u2019s own Stop Fuelling The Climate Crisis campaign is highlighting steps towards ending support for fossil fuel projects\u00a0at home and overseas, as the UK looks to lead the world on the climate crisis at Cop26. Drawing on more than 14,000 scientific papers, the IPCC review is set to provide the latest knowledge on past and potential future warming, how humans are changing the climate and how that is increasing extreme weather events and driving sea-level rises. A summary report is being published after being approved in a process involving scientists and representatives of 195 governments over the past two weeks. That means governments have signed off on the findings, and the pressure will be on them to take more action at talks in Glasgow this November. Insiders who have been given a preview of the report say global temperatures look certain to rise 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2040 at the latest, according to the  Sunday Times . Tom Rivett-Carnac, one of the climate experts who helped create the Paris Agreement in 2015, told the newspaper: \u201cThe IPCC report is going to be devastating in its reports of what is to come if we don\u2019t deal with this. The increasing natural disasters \u2026 will, I think, turn this into quite an interesting turning-point moment over the course of the next few weeks.\u201d Professor Piers Forster from Leeds University, one of the scientists involved in the process, said the report would contain \u201cquite a lot of bad news about where we are and where we\u2019re going\u201d. But he added that there are going to be \u201cnuggets of optimism\u201d in the report too. \u201cIf we can really get our act together to cut our greenhouse gas emissions within the next 10-year time frame and to get to these net-zero targets that everyone is talking about, there\u2019s a good chance we can try and keep temperatures in the longer term below 1.5 degrees,\u201d he told LBC. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK chief scientist, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more pledges, commitments and targets \u2013 we need real action right here right now to cut planet-heating emissions as fast as possible, phase out fossil fuels, transform our food system and deliver more cash to the countries worst hit by the climate crisis.\u201d And Fredrick Njehu, Christian Aid\u2019s senior climate change and energy adviser for Africa, warned: \u201cThe important thing now is that rich world governments make up for lost time and act quickly to reduce emissions and deliver promised financial support for the vulnerable.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

This is clearly a huge problem, as seen when it comes to climate change, vaccines and expertise in general \u2013 with anti-scientific attitudes   increasingly influencing politics . So why can\u2019t we stop such views from spreading? My opinion is that we have failed to understand their root causes, often assuming it is down to ignorance. But new research, published in my book,  Knowledge Resistance: How We Avoid Insight from Others , shows that the capacity to ignore valid facts has most likely had adaptive value throughout human evolution. Therefore, this capacity is in our genes today. Ultimately, realising this is our best bet to tackle the problem. So far, public intellectuals have roughly made two core arguments about our post-truth world. The physician Hans Rosling and the psychologist Steven Pinker argue it has come about due to deficits in facts and reasoned thinking \u2013 and can therefore be sufficiently tackled with education. Today, we are part of many groups and internet networks and can in some sense \u2018shop around\u2019 for new alliances if our old groups don\u2019t like us Meanwhile, Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists have shown how the mere provision of more and better facts often lead already polarised groups to become even more polarised in their beliefs. The conclusion of Thaler is that humans are deeply irrational, operating with harmful biases. The best way to tackle it is therefore nudging \u2013 tricking our irrational brains \u2013 for instance by changing measles vaccination from an opt-in to a less burdensome opt-out choice. The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty Getty The Independent \/ Getty The Independent \/ Getty Such arguments have often resonated well with frustrated climate scientists, public health experts and agri-scientists (complaining about GMO-opposers). Still, their solutions clearly remain insufficient for dealing with a fact-resisting, polarised society. Evolutionary pressures In my study, I interviewed eminent academics at the University of Oxford, London School of Economics and King\u2019s College London, about their views. They were experts on social, economic and  evolutionary  sciences. I analysed their comments in the context of the latest findings on topics ranging from the origin of humanity, climate change and vaccination to religion and gender differences. It became evident that much of knowledge resistance is better understood as a manifestation of social rationality. Essentially, humans are social animals; fitting into a group is what\u2019s most important to us. Often, objective knowledge-seeking can help strengthen group bonding \u2013 such as when you prepare a well-researched action plan for your colleagues at work. But when knowledge and group bonding don\u2019t converge, we often prioritise fitting in over pursuing the most valid knowledge. In one large experiment, it turned out that both liberals and conservatives actively  avoided having conversations with people  of the other side on issues of drug policy, death penalty and gun ownership. This was the case even when they were offered a chance of winning money if they discussed with the other group. Avoiding the insights from opposing groups helped people dodge having to criticise the view of their own community. Similarly, if your community strongly opposes what an overwhelming part of science concludes about vaccination or climate change, you often unconsciously prioritise avoiding getting into conflicts about it. \u00a0Those among the earliest humans who weren\u2019t prepared to share the beliefs of their community ran the risk of being distrusted and even excluded This is further backed up by research  showing that the climate deniers who score the highest on scientific literacy tests are more confident than the average in that group that climate change isn\u2019t happening \u2013 despite the evidence showing it is happening. And those among the climate concerned who score the highest on the same tests are more confident than the average in that group that climate change is happening. This logic of prioritising the means that get us accepted and secured in a group we respect is deep. Those among the earliest humans who weren\u2019t prepared to share the beliefs of their community ran the risk of being distrusted and even excluded. And social exclusion was an enormous increased threat against survival \u2013 they could be killed by other groups or animals; or die because they had no one to cooperate with. These early humans therefore had much lower chances of reproducing. It therefore seems fair to conclude that being prepared to resist knowledge and facts is an evolutionary, genetic adaptation of humans to the socially challenging life in hunter-gatherer societies. Today, we are part of many groups and internet networks, to be sure, and can in some sense \u201cshop around\u201d for new alliances if our old groups don\u2019t like us. Still, humanity today shares the same  binary mindset  and strong drive to avoid being socially excluded as our ancestors who only knew about a few groups. The groups we are part of also help shape our identity, which can make it hard to change groups. Individuals who change groups and opinions constantly may also be less trusted, even among their new peers. In my research, I show how this matters when it comes to dealing with fact resistance. Ultimately, we need to take social aspects into account when communicating facts and arguments with various groups. This could be through using role models, new ways of framing problems, new rules and routines in our organisations and new types of scientific narratives that resonate with the intuitions and interests of more groups than our own. There are no quick fixes, of course. But if climate change were reframed from the liberal\/leftist moral perspective of the need for global fairness towards conservative perspectives of respect for the authority of the father land, the sacredness of God\u2019s creation and the individual\u2019s right not to have their life project jeopardised by climate change, this might resonate better with conservatives. Taking social factors into account would help us create new and more powerful ways to fight belief in conspiracy theories and  fake news . I hope my approach will stimulate joint efforts of moving beyond disputes disguised as controversies over facts and into conversations about what often matters more deeply to us as social beings.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The average global temperature has risen by more than 1C in the last 140 years \u2013 what\u2019s going on and does it matter? Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Global warming ,  climate change ,  climate crisis , climate breakdown, and  climate emergency  are all terms which describe a major threat to life as we know it on our planet, but what are people talking about when they use these terms? Climate and  weather The first important aspect to understanding the world\u2019s climate is distinguishing \u201cclimate\u201d from \u201cweather\u201d. Weather refers only to the changeable short-term atmospheric conditions in a place or area, while climate refers to a much longer pattern of weather behaviour, and can change from season to season. But there is also the overall climate of the Earth, which is understood through combining the long-term climate records together to build a picture of the trends affecting our planet. While weather patterns can change over just a few hours, climates usually take hundreds, thousands or even millions of years to change. However, since the middle of the 20th century, scientists around the world have been warning that climates all around the world, which had been stable for thousands of years, are beginning to change fast and that it is human activity which is largely causing the current changes. What is happening? Overall, the world is getting warmer \u2013 this is why the process is often known as \u201cglobal warming\u201d. The average global temperature on Earth has increased by more than 1C (2F) since 1880. Two-thirds of that warming has occurred since just 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15-0.20C per decade. However the world is not uniformly getting hotter. Some areas, such as the Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than others, and rising average temperatures can have numerous other consequences, which is why the process is better described as \u201cclimate change\u201d or \u201cclimate breakdown\u201d. From a human perspective the huge array of negative impacts on us and other species mean it can be thought of as a \u201cclimate crisis\u201d or \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. How is the climate changing? The Earth\u2019s climate is always changing, and before we examine why scientists believe humans are having such a large impact on the climate, it is important to recognise that various natural factors cause major changes to the climate. These include: Human-driven climate change Records show that over the last 6,000 years the Earth was on  a long slow cooling trajectory , which then suddenly ended during the late Victorian period, around 150 years ago. At this time the human world had already embarked upon a global campaign of industrialisation \u2013 a process still underway. The dawn of industrialisation ignited a planet-wide scramble to excavate exceptionally combustible, energy-rich fuels such as coal, oil and gas, to provide the power required for an endless array of processes including manufacturing, transport, heating and cooling buildings, and domestic use. This fossil fuel extraction boom is still underway. Though many countries are increasingly switching to renewable energy sources,  in 2020 , fossil fuels still accounted for 84 per cent of global energy generation, and around the world companies are still planning to keep extracting them. When fossil fuels are burnt, they emit gases which act to trap the Sun\u2019s heat within the atmosphere, thereby heating up the planet like a greenhouse. This is why they are known as greenhouse gases. As the process of industrialisation altered societies and produced breakthroughs, particularly in medicine and agriculture, populations of humans have risen sharply around the world. As well as growing populations demanding greater energy resources \u2013 particularly in the richest societies \u2013 more people also require more food. As a result, agriculture has had an increasing effect on land use and greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 particularly for meat production. The key greenhouse gases are: Carbon dioxide Methane Ozone Nitrous oxide Chlorofluorocarbons They all come from different processes, have different concentrations in the atmosphere, and have  different impacts  over different timescales. Carbon dioxide accounts for about 80 per cent of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but methane, which makes up about 10 per cent, is much more powerful, though over a shorter amount of time. Nitrous oxide accounts for about 7 per cent, and the fluorinated gases, which are synthetic and very powerful greenhouse gases emitted from a variety of industrial processes, make up the remaining 3 per cent. Impacts of the climate crisis A warming world has terrifying consequences. We are already witnessing many of the impacts of climate change, in the form of extreme weather events and an increasing rate of sea level rise, but if the current rate of warming continues, then the worst is still yet to come. Scientists have warned we will see more frequent and more intense periods of drought; devastating heatwaves which could increase desertification and make areas of the world uninhabitable; more powerful storms; flooding; warming oceans; melting glaciers; retreating sea ice; lack of snow cover; rising sea levels and the destruction of coastal cities where millions live, and biodiversity collapse, risking famines and global food shortages, and therefore increasing risks of conflict and raising the likelihood of mass migrations. Response Responding to the multifarious threats posed by the climate crisis is set to be one of our species\u2019 biggest challenges to date. This is because for many societies, a successful response will involve major recalibrations to people\u2019s fundamental values and expectations, as well as deep changes to the systems and institutions our societies have built themselves on over the last century or more. But if we are unequal to this recalibration the terrible repercussions will intensify and loom ahead of us like an increasingly sinister spectre. Solutions The one key thing humans must do to slow down our journey into fiery doom is stop producing emissions of greenhouse gases. The other key thing we must do is repair the damage we have done to the natural world \u2013 this will draw the pollutants out of the atmosphere and help slow down the heating process. Governments around the world are currently only taking small steps to reduce certain emissions and protect and restore a few select ecosystems. These are glimmers of recognition of the problem, but much more needs to be done.

What a shame!\u2019 president Jair Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook after saying that foreign interest in the Amazon was \u2018financially motivated\u2019 Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Brazil\u2019s leader Jair Bolsonaro has fired back at Democratic candidate Joe Biden following his remarks about Amazon rainforests during the first presidential debate. The fractious back and forth between President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden on Tuesday took an unexpected turn to the climate crisis after moderator Chris Wallace dropped in a question towards the end of the debate. Both candidates laid out their opposing views on the global Paris Climate Accord, which Mr Trump has pledged to walk away from, while Mr Biden has vowed to rejoin. \"I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s all falling apart,\u201d Mr Biden said, criticising the president as \u201csomeone who has no relationship with foreign policy\u201d and using Brazil to illustrate his point. \u201cThe rainforests of Brazil are being torn down,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cI would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, \u2018Here\u2019s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re going to have significant economic consequences.\u2019\u201d Mr Bolsonaro lashed out on Facebook having interpreted Mr Biden\u2019s comment as a threat of economic sanctions on Brazil. Referring to the vice president as \u201cMr John Biden\u201d, he wrote that he doesn\u2019t accept \u201cbribes\u201d or \u201ccoward threats\u201d. He said that Brazil was tackling the rampant deforestation which is fueling wildfires and said foreign interest in the Amazon was \u201cfinancially motivated\u201d. \u201cThe greed of some countries towards the Amazon is a well-known fact,\u201d the Brazilian leader wrote. \u201cHowever, the explicit demonstration of this greed by someone who is running for the presidency of his country is a clear sign of contempt for cordial and fruitful coexistence between two sovereign nations.\u201d He ended the statement by calling Joe Biden by the wrong first name. \u201cWhat a shame, Mr. John Biden! What a shame!\u201d he wrote. Mr Bolsonaro, dubbed the \u201cTrump of the Tropics\u201d, has sought to ally himself with the current administration. The president hosted the Brazilian leader and his entourage for a dinner at Mar-A-Lago in March after which one of the delegation tested positive for Covid-19.\u00a0 Amazon fires are at the  highest level in a decade . A surge in fires in August 2019 to a nine-year high provoked outcry from global leaders and the public that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the world\u2019s largest rainforest. Environmental advocates and scientists say that Mr Bolsonaro is to blame for weakening environmental protections and calling for the development of the Amazon.\u00a0 He has been an enthusiastic ring-leader to miners, cattle ranchers and illegal loggers pushing into one of the planet's richest regions of biodiversity, and the home of thousands of indigenous peoples. Mr Bolsonaro, a climate denier, insisted last month that there are no fires in the Amazon rainforest, calling evidence produced by his own government showing thousands of blazes a \u201clie\u201d. In July, the Brazilian government instituted a three-month \"moratorium\" on fires in the Amazon following the deployment of troops earlier in the year to prevent blazes being started. The moves appear to have ineffective.

The UK is set to become the first major economy to commit to completely avoiding emissions from homes, transport, farming and industry or offsetting them by planting trees and sucking carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere.  The amendment to the  Climate Change  Act has been widely welcomed as a significant milestone.  However, some environmental groups are concerned that even this pledge does not go far enough and they have raised concerns about the UK using international  carbon credits  to shift the burden of carbon cutting to other nations. Craig Bennett, UK chief executive of  Friends of the Earth , warned it was \u201cstill too slow to address catastrophic climate change\u201d. Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan He said the next prime minister must put carbon-cutting \u201cat the centre of policy-making and pull the plug on plans for more roads, runways and fracking\u201d. Legislating for international carbon credits means the UK could pay for other countries to cut their carbon instead of reducing domestic emissions. Critics said this showed the government is not taking the issue seriously enough and could mean it shirks environmental obligations.  \u201cIt is disappointing that the government has ignored its climate advisers\u2019 recommendation to exclude carbon offsets,\" Mr Bennett said.  He added: \"Having declared a climate emergency, parliament must act to close these loopholes.\u201d Doug Parr,  Greenpeace  UK\u2019s chief scientist, also said it was a \u201cbig moment\u201d for the climate, but added there were \u201cquestions to be asked about (the) offsetting loophole\u201d, which has a history of failure. \u201cAs the birthplace of the industrial revolution, it is right that the UK is the world\u2019s first major economy to commit to completely end its contribution to climate change, but trying to shift the burden to developing nations through International Carbon Credits undermines that commitment,\u201d he said.  Professor Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London (UCL), said Britain should adopt a 2030 zero carbon target. He said that if there was any chance of keeping the planet from warming more than 2C, the whole world must hit zero carbon emissions by 2050.  \u201cBritain is one of the leading countries in the fight against climate change and we must adopt a 2030 zero carbon target,\" he said. \"This will give us 10 years to put in place win-win solutions that reduce carbon emissions, save money and make Britain a better, cleaner place to live.\" Climate change activists  Extinction Rebellion , who staged demonstrations in a number of British cities earlier this year, blocking parts of central London for days, were most scathing about the 2050 target, describing it as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d.  Number 10 said the move would boost public health, air quality and nature and will make the UK a leader on climate action. But it said it was \u201cimperative\u201d other countries follow suit. The government will review the pledge within five years to ensure other nations are taking similarly ambitious action and that British industries are not facing unfair competition. Lord Deben, chairman of the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change, praised the \u201cmajor commitment\u201d and said he was looking forward to cross-party consensus on the issue. \u201cThis step will send a strong signal to other countries to follow suit \u2013 and will help to drive the global effort to tackle climate change required by the Paris Agreement,\u201d he said. Reuters AP Getty  EPA AFP\/Getty Images AP Getty Images AFP\/Getty Images PA PA Getty AP EPA Reuters Getty EPA Getty Reuters Getty PA EPA EPA AP EPA EPA AFP\/Getty Images EPA EPA AFP\/Getty AP PA AP EPA PA PA PA PA Getty  Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said UK companies were \u201csquarely behind\u201d the commitment and called it the \u201cright response to the global climate crisis\u201d. But she urged the government to ensure the legislation was followed by long-term policies to support decarbonisation across the economy. Hitting net zero \u2013 a 100 per cent cut in emissions \u2013 will mean an end to heating of homes with traditional gas boilers, more green electricity, and a switch from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles, walking and cycling. Any remaining pollution in 2050 from areas including aviation will need to be \u201coffset\u201d through measures to cut carbon such as planting trees. Environment analyst Tom Burke said there was \u201cquite a gap\u201d emerging between announcements on climate change and the implementation of policies. \u201cThe reality is it\u2019s what you do, not what you say, that matters,\" he told BBC  Breakfast.  \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a gap, in a way, emerging recently between what the government has said it wants to do on climate change and the fact that the policies aren\u2019t in place to deliver on the existing budgets, let alone the carbon budgets we\u2019ll need if we\u2019re to meet this new commitment.\u201d Shadow energy secretary  Rebecca Long Bailey  raised concerns over how the commitment would be put into practice. \u201cWhile this announcement is welcome in theory, in practice it comes from a Conservative government that is off track to meet existing climate targets, that has no plans for legislation or investment needed to cut emissions, and that has dismantled the UK renewable energy sector while pushing fracking,\u201d she said.

The increasingly disastrous impacts of the  climate crisis , coupled with inaction to tackle it are sending our planet down a bleak path towards an increasingly chaotic world which could overwhelm societies around the globe,  the report \u2019s authors contend. The paper, produced by the Melbourne-based think tank the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration, is presented by the former chief of the  Australian Defence Forces  and retired Royal Australian Navy Admiral Chris Barrie. In his introduction he says the report\u2019s authors \u201chave laid bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans, and our planet, are in, painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on earth may be on the way to extinction, in the most horrible way.\u201d The paper argues that \u201c climate change  now represents a near to mid-term existential threat to human civilisation,\u201d and calls for a recalibration in how governments respond to estimated climate scenarios so they take worst case projections more seriously. AFP\/Getty Getty\/iStock AFP\/Gett Getty H Goehlich Getty\/Lumix Getty\/iStock AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Nature Seychelles AFP\/Getty C Reveret AFP\/Getty Getty\/Tourism Queensland AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty\/Lumix AFP\/Getty Sarah Frias-Torres  AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty It also argues that the detrimental impacts of climate breakdown, such as increasing scarcity of food and water, will act as a catalyst on extant socio-political instabilities to accelerate disorder and conflict over the next three decades. To usefully prepare for such an impact, the report calls for an overhaul in countries\u2019 risk management \u201cwhich is fundamentally different from conventional practice\u201d.  \u201cIt would focus on the high-end, unprecedented possibilities, instead of assessing middle-of-the-road probabilities on the basis of historic experience.\u201d The research was authored by David Spratt, Breakthrough\u2019s research director, and Ian Dunlop, a former international oil, gas and coal industry executive, who worked for Royal Dutch Shell and was chair of the Australian Coal Association. Their paper offers what they say is a plausible scenario providing \u201ca glimpse into a world of outright chaos\u201d. Based on lack of meaningful global action to rapidly extinguish all greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade, the authors sketch out a scenario in which global emissions peak in 2030.  In this case, using several existing studies, they hypothesise average global temperatures may reach 3C above pre-industrial levels by 2050.  The effect of this would be to realise the \u201c hothouse Earth \u201d scenario in which the planet would be heading for at least another degree of warming. The reflective sea ice would melt, warming oceans further and raising sea levels rapidly. There would be \u201cwidespread permafrost loss and large-scale Amazon drought and dieback\u201d. The scenario reads: \u201cThe destabilisation of the Jet Stream has very significantly affected the intensity and geographical distribution of the Asian and West African monsoons and, together with the further slowing of the Gulf Stream, is impinging on life support systems in Europe.  \u201cNorth America suffers from devastating weather extremes including wildfires, heatwaves, drought and inundation. The summer monsoons in China have failed, and water flows into the great rivers of Asia are severely reduced by the loss of more than one-third of the Himalayan ice sheet.  \u201cGlacial loss reaches 70 per cent in the Andes, and rainfall in Mexico and central America falls by half.\u201d This scenario would also put the world on track for 5C of warming by 2100. The paper notes that scientists have already warned that warming of 4C is incompatible with an organised global community, would be devastating to the majority of ecosystems, and has a high probability of not being stable. The World Bank said the planet may be \u201cbeyond adaptation\u201d to such conditions. \u201cEven for 2C of warming, more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios, the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of human civilisation coming to an end,\u201d the paper says. The authors say \u201cthe world is currently completely unprepared to envisage, and even less deal with, the consequences of catastrophic climate change,\u201d but also put forward policy recommendations which could help to mitigate the worst effects. \u201cTo reduce this risk and protect human civilisation, a massive global mobilisation of resources is needed in the coming decade to build a zero-emissions industrial system and set in train the restoration of a safe climate.  \u201cThis would be akin in scale to the World War II emergency mobilisation.\u201d Admiral Barrie added: \u201cA doomsday future is not inevitable! But without immediate drastic action our prospects are poor. We must act collectively.

The hottest temperature ever recorded came in July last year, when Cambridge University Botanic Gardens reached 38.7C. And a new publication by the Met Office, its annual  State of the UK Climate report , published on what was due to be the  hottest day of the year , has laid out a series of other records broken in 2019, all of which confirm the UK is getting hotter and hotter. Last year also saw the hottest ever winter temperature of 21.2C, measured at Kew Gardens in London on 26 February. And the mildest February day on record was logged last year, when the lowest temperature was only 13.9C, at Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands on 23 February.

Although 2019 was only the 12th warmest year on average since records began, its average temperatures were still 1.1C higher than the long-term trends from 1961 to 1990. All of the 10 warmest years on record have come since 2002, and one data series for central England which stretches back even further to 1659 shows the 21 st  century has been warmer than the three preceding centuries. \u201cOur report shows climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK\u2019s climate,\u201d said Mike Kendon, the report\u2019s lead author from the Met Office. \u201cThis year was warmer than any other year in the UK between 1884 and 1990, and since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series. \u201cBy contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963 \u2013 over 50 years ago.\u201d Climate change was not just having a warming impact but was also making other kinds of weather more extreme, the Met Office reported. Last year saw significant  flooding  across Britain, including in Lincolnshire, the Pennines, South Yorkshire, and the East Midlands. Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office\u2019s National Climate Information Centre, said 2019 was the latest in a series of especially wet years, and for northern England marked the ninth most rainfall in a year since records began in 1862. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that since 2009 the UK has now had its wettest February, April, June, November and December on record \u2013 five out of 12 months,\u201d  he told the BBC .  Professor Richard Allan, a climate scientist from the University of Reading, said: \u201cThe record hot days and sticky nights observed in the UK during 2019 are an expected result of a warming climate that is intensifying heatwaves as well as heavy rainfall events, whenever they occur. \u201cWhat is not captured in these reports are the remote consequences of climate change that are increasingly affecting our country through effects on global food prices, environmental degradation and national security.\u201d Dr Friederike Otto, from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said the Met Office report was just another piece of evidence which showed how climate change could already be felt in British weather. \u201cFor heatwaves, climate change is a real game changer. Rapid analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative showed that the record-breaking 38.7C heat in Cambridgeshire in 2019 was made at least twice as likely due to climate change.\u201d As the UK\u2019s warming continued, we should expect to see more and more heatwaves, as well as both droughts and floods, as a result of climate change, she warned. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t happening gracefully,\u201d said Professor Martin Siegert from Imperial College London. \u201cThe weather records that have been broken inform us to expect more records as global warming continues; more heatwaves and droughts, more rainfall and floods, and more snow and icy-cold blasts. \u201cThe longer we leave it until we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, the worse our future weather is likely to be.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Analysis of likely outcomes suggests a \u201clooming human crisis\u201d as the inhabitants of at-risk countries move within their national borders to safer areas. These people will be driven by growing problems like water scarcity, crop failure, sea-level rise and storm surges, all of which are linked with the changing climate. The report is the first of its kind to combine socioeconomic data with climate impact analysis to predict likely shifts in populations within countries as a result of climate change. According to the researchers\u2019 analysis, a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d could see over 143 million people moving within their country's borders by 2050 as the effects of climate change make their homes uninhabitable. As the analysis only explored three developing regions \u2013 sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America \u2013 the worldwide numbers could be far larger. Awareness of \u201cclimate  refugees \u201d has been growing steadily in recent years, and the scientists behind the new report noted that cross-border migration in particular has been \u201ccapturing media attention\u201d.  Barack Obama has  warned that climate change  could create a refugee crisis that is \u201cunprecedented in human history\u201d, and one study predicted global warming could cause asylum applications in Europe  to nearly triple . Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan However, internal migration as a result of climate change has received less coverage, despite its potential for severe social and economic disruption. \u201cInternal migration \u2013 that is people moving within their borders \u2013 is probably three times the level or international migration,\u201d said John Roome, senior director for climate change at the World Bank. World Bank chief executive officer Kristalina Georgieva said the research provides a wake-up call to countries and development institutions.  \u201cWe have a small window now, before the effects of climate change deepen, to prepare the ground for this new reality,\u201d she said.  \u201cSteps cities take to cope with the upward trend of arrivals from rural areas and to improve opportunities for education, training and jobs will pay long-term dividends.  \u201cIt\u2019s also important to help people make good decisions about whether to stay where they are or move to new locations where they are less vulnerable.\u201d The authors of the report looked at three potential climate change and development paths, ranging from \u201cpessimistic\u201d to \u201cclimate friendly\u201d. They noted that certain \u201chotspots\u201d are likely to experience drastic out and in-migration.  As water availability declines in the northern highlands of Ethiopia, for example, people are likely to rapidly evacuate its agricultural regions.  Meanwhile, population hubs like Mexico City and Nairobi will see significant influxes of people fleeing regions hit hard by climate change. \u201cWithout the right planning and support, people migrating from rural areas into cities could be facing new and even more dangerous risks,\u201d said the report\u2019s team lead Dr Kanta Kumari Rigaud.  \u201cWe could see increased tensions and conflict as a result of pressure on scarce resources.\u201d However, the team behind the research also said the situation is far from hopeless, and there is much that can be done to curtail climate migration and the problems associated with it. \u201cThis is the worst case scenario \u2013 although there will be some climate migration under any scenario, this does not have to be a crisis,\u201d said Mr Roome \u201cIf we can take action now that is significant with respect to both climate change and development planning, this number of 140 million people could be reduced by as much as 80 per cent.\u201d Key actions recommended by the report include cutting greenhouse gas emissions, transforming development planning to account for the reality of climate migration and investing in more analysis to understand migration trends on individual country levels. The report comes ahead of the Global Compact on Migration, which is currently being negotiated in the United Nations (UN) and has the potential to provide protection for climate refugees under international law.

The planet\u2019s average temperature has already risen about 1C in about 130 years, with scientists admitting that restricting this to just 0.5C more will be difficult. However the report \u2013 released by the  United Nations Development Programme  and a group of 43 developing countries which are highly vulnerable to climate change \u2013 argued doing so would be worth it. As a result, the world\u2019s gross domestic product would fall by $21 trillion by 2050, compared to $33 trillion under a \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 approach that allows global warming of 2.5 degrees. This saving of $12 trillion (about \u00a39.6 trillion) represents about 10 per cent of global GDP. It would also \u201csubstantially\u201d reduce the risk of the flooding of large parts of the world\u2019s lowest lying land, \u201cwith the  Greenland  ice sheet facing irreversible decline most likely around 1.6C of warming\u201d. All the ice on Greenland would take some time to melt but would raise sea levels by seven metres once completely gone. Keeping global warming to 1.5 per cent would mean at least 10 per cent of the coral reefs on the planet would survive; any higher and the \u201cvirtual disappearance\u201d of this key marine ecosystem would begin. The report, called  Pursuing the 1.5C Limit , said such changes would dramatically affect the world\u2019s economy. \u201cIn the high-warming scenario in Bangladesh, GDP per capita growth would decrease from 6 per cent per year in a no-climate-change reference scenario, to only 4 per cent, and annual growth for China would be reduced from 2 per cent to 0.5 per cent per year,\u201d it said. \u201cThe contractions in India and China alone may have large implications specifically on the growth of neighbouring countries in the region, as well as the world economy.  \u201cThese reductions in macroeconomic outputs induced by climate-change impacts could therefore pose a very serious challenge to poverty eradication efforts in the developing world.  NASA INDEPENDENT GRAPHICS \u201cIn rich countries like Japan and the USA, climate-change damages might flip the GDP projections from a modest annual growth to a potential annual decline, in the absence of adaptation.\u201d Writing in the report\u2019s foreword, Professor Magdy Martinez-Soliman, of the United Nations Development Programme, said: \u201cPursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C is absolutely critical so that all countries take strong and ambitious action on the ground.  \u201cThis global threshold will guide our efforts for decades to come and shape our achievement of the goals we agreed to within the Paris Agreement.\u201d He said that efforts to restrict global warming would also help tackle poverty.

A recent study suggests still another consequence: Some types of poaching may also accelerate  climate change . Forest  elephants  \u2013 the smaller, endangered relatives of  African  savanna elephants \u2013 promote the growth of large trees that excel at storing  carbon , according to research published in the journal  Nature Geoscience . Should forest elephants disappear, scientists estimated, Central Africa\u2019s rainforest will lose about 3 billion tons of carbon \u2013 the equivalent of  France \u2019s total  CO2 emissions  for 27 years. \u201cThis new paper points to something that we in Central Africa have suspected for a long time, but now this group has thrown some serious science at the issue,\u201d said Fiona Maisels, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and at the University of Stirling in  Scotland . \u201cWith the loss of forest elephants,\u201d she added, \u201closs of carbon stocks can be added to the list of ecosystem services that are no longer provided by these animals.\u201d World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection World Animal Protection Over recent years, researchers have gained a more detailed understanding of the links between animals and climate.  Wild grazers, for instance, can reduce the intensity and frequency of fires that emit greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from livestock significantly contribute to  global warming . Scientists have also known for decades that large herbivores such as elephants play important short-term roles in ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, recycling nutrients and dispersing seeds. Fabio Berzaghi, an ecologist at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France and the lead author of the new study, suspected that elephants might also play a profound long-term role in shaping Africa\u2019s rainforest, second in size only to the  Amazon\u2019s . The Amazon lost its large herbivores 12,000 years ago, among them ground sloths that weighed over 3 tons, elephant-like creatures called gomphotheres and armadillo-like glyptodonts that were the size of small cars. The loss of these and other large herbivores likely contributed to the Amazon\u2019s higher density of smaller trees, with a lower overall amount of vegetation compared with Africa\u2019s rainforest. \u201cWe were thinking elephants may play a role in the differences between these two continents\u2019 forests,\u201d Mr Berzaghi said. \u201cWe also really wanted to know what the long-term consequences of losing this species would be.\u201d Mr Berzaghi and his colleagues selected two field sites. One lies in the  Democratic Republic of Congo , from which elephants disappeared 30 years ago because of poaching; the other is the Republic of Congo, where elephants lived at high numbers until recently. Both sites were relatively pristine and differed only in the presence or absence of elephants. The researchers measured the trunk size of all the trees in the study areas and noted the species, giving them an idea of the short-term effects of elephant loss. To determine the long-term effects, they created a computer model that simulated the basic functions of the African rainforest, including tree growth and death, competition, photosynthesis and reproduction. The model allowed them to include or exclude elephants. Forest elephants almost exclusively stomp down trees with a diameter of 12 inches or less, and they prefer to eat fast-growing softwood trees. By clearing the understory of vegetation, the researchers found, elephants not only alter plant composition but also affect light penetration and water availability. This results in an ecosystem that favours large, slow-growing hardwood trees. Such species store significantly more carbon than the equivalent volume of smaller softwood trees. \u201cAs a tree, there\u2019s a trade-off \u2013 you can\u2019t have it all,\u201d Mr Berzaghi said. \u201cYou either invest in growing fast or in building a lot of structure with carbon to be more resistant.\u201d Extrapolating their findings to the whole of Africa\u2019s rainforest, Mr Berzaghi and his colleagues found that the disappearance of elephants would result in a 7 per cent loss of vegetation \u2013 the equivalent of 3 billion tons of carbon storage. Put another way, elephants provide a carbon storage service valued at $43bn (\u00a335.6bn). \u201cThis is the first study I have seen attributing large, multimegaton changes in carbon to a particular species,\u201d said Rosie Fisher, a scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,  Colorado , who was not involved in the research.  \u201cIt really opens a new frontier in how we think about interactions between large animals and carbon storage.\u201d Save for a few surviving populations, forest elephants are functionally extinct in almost all of their former 850,000-square-mile habitat.  The species declined by 62 per cent from 2002 to 2011, Ms Maisels and her colleagues found, and poaching has largely continued unchecked since then. According to Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, a conservation organisation based in  Kenya , the killing has most recently spread to  Gabon , which holds half of the world\u2019s remaining forest elephants and was previously protected from poaching by its relative isolation. \u201cThis study comes at a time when forest elephants are threatened as never before,\u201d Mr Douglas-Hamilton said.  \u201cIt is appalling that just as we are beginning to understand how elephants might have a key role in Africa in sequestering carbon, they are under real threat of eradication.\u201d One limitation of the study, Mr Berzaghi said, is that we do not know how much carbon has already been lost because of the elephants\u2019 decline. But it does seem certain, he added, that putting a stop to poaching and restoring forest elephant populations would bring climate benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence mounting that elephants are a key species that benefit not just their ecosystem, but all ecosystems,\u201d he said.  \u201cClimate change is a complex issue that will probably require a lot of small solutions, and this might be one of those solutions.\u201d The New York Times Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

But what caused our ancient ancestors to become extinct, while Homo sapiens have spread across the planet?  According to new research, the reasons other human species died out could be the same as the biggest threat to our long-term survival today -  climate change . Researchers combined climate modelling and fossil records in search of clues for why all these earlier  extinctions  happened, and found the inability to adapt to either warming or cooling climates played \u201ca major role\u201d in sealing their fate. \u201cOur findings show that despite technological innovations including the use of fire and refined stone tools, the formation of complex social networks, and - in the case of Neanderthals - even the production of glued spear points, fitted clothes, and a good amount of cultural and genetic exchange with  Homo sapiens , past Homo species could not survive intense climate change,\" said Pasquale Raia of the University of Naples Federico II, in Italy. \"They tried hard; they made for the warmest places in reach as the climate got cold, but at the end of the day, that wasn't enough.\" The researchers used a high-resolution past climate emulator to provide temperature, rainfall and other data to provide climate models covering the last five million years. This period covers the extinction of early human species including  Homo habilis ,  Homo ergaster ,  Homo erectus , Homo  heidelbergensis , and  Homo   neanderthalensis . They also examined an extensive fossil database spanning more than 2,750 archaeological records in order to model the evolution of Homo species\u2019 climatic niche over time.  The goal was to understand the climate preferences of those early humans and how they reacted to changes in climate.

They report that this reduction coincided with sharp, unfavorable changes in the global climate.  In the case of Neanderthals, things were likely made even worse by competition with  Homo sapiens . \u201cWe were surprised by the regularity of the effect of climate change,\u201d said Dr Raia. \u201cIt was crystal clear, for the extinct species and for them only, that climatic conditions were just too extreme just before extinction and only in that particular moment.\" Dr Raia noted that there remains uncertainty in paleoclimatic reconstruction, as well as some identification of fossil remains at the level of species, and the aging of fossil sites. But he said the main insights \u201chold true under all assumptions\u201d. The findings serve as a warning to humans today as we face unprecedented changes in the climate, Dr Raia said. \u201cIt is worrisome to discover that our ancestors, which were no less impressive in terms of mental power as compared to any other species on Earth, could not resist climate change,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd we found that just when our own species is sawing the branch we're sitting on by causing climate change.  \u201cI personally take this as a thunderous warning message. Climate change made Homo vulnerable and hapless in the past, and this may just be happening again.\u201d The research is published in the journal  Cell Press .

The delay in ice formation is blamed on a period of unusually warm weather in northern Russia.  Conservationists have warned that a lack of sea ice is not just a gloomy portent of  climate change  but could affect sea life as drifting ice carries with it nutrients for Arctic plankton. Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, who shared the data in a series of graphs, said the Arctic was experiencing an \u201chistoric event\u201d and that the extent of sea ice was \u201ccurrently the lowest on record for the date\u201d. He said: \u201cThe amount of open water this fall is absurd. We have to pay attention to these climate change indicators.\u201d Arctic sea ice normally reaches its low point in September and its highest in March after the winter. Mr Labe said September sea ice thickness was also below average across almost the entire Arctic Ocean, compared to the 1981-2010 average. Ice formation in Siberian Arctic has slowed significantly in recent years, with 2020 the worst year and 2018 the next worst in terms of the extent of the frozen surface. According to scientists, a Siberian heat wave last spring and a natural Arctic climate phenomenon are to blame as well as the worldwide warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Temperatures for much of the year were eight to 10 degrees Celsius above normal in the Siberian Arctic. In September, the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre reported that ice covered just 3.74 million square kilometres of Arctic waters at its lowest point this summer \u2014 only the second time on record (the other year being 2012) that this had dropped below 4 million square kilometres. Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty EPA Getty Getty In the 1980s, the ice cover was about 2.7 million square kilometres bigger than current summer levels. Studies show that the warming of the Arctic and the melting of sea ice change weather further south, by altering the jet stream and other waves that move weather systems.

After  carbon dioxide , methane is the second biggest contributor to  global warming , and levels in the atmosphere have increased by about 150 per cent since the industrial revolution. Though there is less of it than CO2, methane\u2019s greenhouse effect is around 80 times more potent. And unlike CO2, which can remain in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for around a century after it is emitted, methane lasts for less than a decade, meaning the impacts of reduction could be felt relatively quickly. \u201cIf we stopped emitting all carbon dioxide today, high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would still persist for a long time,\u201d said University of Rochester researcher Benjamin Hmiel. \u201cMethane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it\u2019s going to reflect more quickly.\u201d Getty AFP\/Getty AP AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Getty Getty PA AFP\/Getty Reuters Carlo Frem\/Amazon AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Jeroen Much\/Andras Schuh Ma Weiwei AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty Getty Levels of methane in the atmosphere are still rising, but until now it has been difficult to determine exactly where the emissions are coming from as methane can be emitted in two distinct ways. These are: through biological activity on the surface of the planet \u2013 such as agriculture, from wetlands, from paddyfields and landfill \u2013 and it is also produced by industrial burning of fossil fuels. The new research has allowed scientists to unpick the difference between the methane produced by burning fossil fuels, and the methane produced biologically, allowing us to see for the first time the extent to which fossil fuels are to blame for introducing damagingly high levels of methane into the atmosphere. The research has considerable implications. \u201cPlacing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,\u201d said Dr Hmiel. The contribution of biological methane in the atmosphere can be detected by a chemical signature \u2013 the presence of carbon-14 \u2013 a rare radioactive isotope. But in fossil fuels, the hydrocarbons required to leave this signature have all broken down \u2013 as the organic matter has spent millions of years underground, so no carbon-14 isotopes are left. While scientists are able to accurately measure total amounts of methane in the atmosphere, the carbon-14 signature, or lack thereof, provides an indication as to how much methane is coming from fossil fuel extraction. In order to more accurately separate the natural and anthropogenic components, Dr Hmiel and his colleagues turned to the past, by drilling and collecting ice cores from Greenland.  The ice core samples act like time capsules, containing bubbles with small quantities of ancient air trapped inside.  The researchers used a melting chamber to extract the ancient air from the bubbles in order to study its chemical composition. The researchers focused on measuring the composition of air from the early 18th century \u2013 before the start of the Industrial Revolution \u2013 to the present day.  Humans did not begin using fossil fuels in significant amounts until the mid-19th century.  Measuring emission levels before this time period allows researchers to identify the natural emissions present at the time without the fossil fuels in today\u2019s atmosphere.  There is no evidence to suggest natural fossil methane emissions can vary over the course of a few centuries. By measuring the carbon-14 isotopes in air from more than 200 years ago, the researchers found that almost all of the methane emitted to the atmosphere was biological in nature until about 1870.  At this point the fossil fuel methane component began to rise rapidly. The timing coincides with a sharp increase in the use of fossil fuels. The researchers said their findings indicate levels of biologically released fossil methane \u2013 by natural processes such as venting \u2013 are about 10 times lower than previous research reported.  Meanwhile the burning of fossil fuels by humans is contributing between 25 \u2013 40 per cent more methane than previously reported. The research indicates the energy sector is failing to account for the levels of the colourless, odourless gas it is pumping into the atmosphere, helping to heat the planet. Dr Hmeil said the findings were positive.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too hopeless on this because my data does have a positive implication: most of the methane emissions are anthropogenic, so we have more control. If we can reduce our emissions, it\u2019s going to have more of an impact.\u201d The research is  published in the journal  Nature .

The planned runway is one of the country\u2019s most hotly contested infrastructure developments due to growing outrage over the additional  greenhouse gas emissions  greater aircraft capacity would herald.  A  consultation document  put out by Heathrow advises the airport expansion will have to take into account changing weather patterns and conditions as a result of climate change, including heatwaves and higher temperatures, the likelihood of storms, and also flood risks. \u201cClimate change has the potential to have a direct effect on the airport,\u201d the document says. \u201cThe assessment has considered a range of different climate changes; higher average temperatures and more heatwave events, reduced summer rainfall, more frequent intense rainfall events; potentially increased extreme wind and storm events; and fewer extreme cold events.\u201d ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News ITV News \u201cIf the airport design did not consider climate change there would be a greater chance of effects such as rainfall filling drainage, increased flooding, overheating in buildings and public spaces, failure of equipment in extreme temperatures, water shortages, operational disruption from storm events, and alterations to affected or new landscapes.\u201d The growth of the UK\u2019s aviation sector is already a significant threat to the UK\u2019s hopes of hitting its stated climate goals. UK airports are set to increase capacity by 59 per cent by 2050 \u2013 more than double the increase accounted for in a report outlining the net-zero target by the  Committee on Climate Change , according to  new research . Friends of the Earth  has taken legal action against the airport expansion, claiming government approval for the third runway did not take into account the impact it would have on climate change. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth,  told The Independent : \u201cIt\u2019s ironic, and almost laughable, to see Heathrow airport going into such detail about the impacts of climate breakdown when the expansion plans would result in a huge increase in carbon emissions. If the airport was properly considering climate, it would abandon its plans for a new runway.\u201d Jonathan Bartley, the joint-leader of the  Green Party , said it was \u201cglaringly obvious\u201d the airport should not be expanded and invoked  George Orwell \u2019s depiction of the UK as \u201cAirstrip One\u201d in 1984. He told  The Independent : \u201cThe staggering absurdity in consulting about how airport expansion can protect itself against the effects of climate change would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so serious.\u201d \u201cThe glaringly obvious response is not to expand Heathrow, or other airports. We need to instead be focusing on promoting European train travel, ditching aviation subsidies and taxing it fairly so that other forms of travel can compete with it.\u201d \u201cWe are in a climate emergency. You cannot both acknowledge that and ignore it at the same time. We\u2019re not living in Orwell\u2019s Oceania.\u201d The consultation comes as  Extinction Rebellion  has announced a wave of over two weeks of drone protests at Heathrow later this year. They said they will fly drones at head height, and not fly over the runway so they will pose no risk to aircraft. Speaking about Heathrow\u2019s climate change guidance, Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Jayne Forbes told  The Independent : \u201cThe sheer hypocrisy of thinking it\u2019s a good idea to do this: They know what they\u2019re doing is contributing to climate change, but they\u2019re trying to respond to that and it\u2019s too late \u2013 they can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI love the irony of them mitigating for climate change but not actually being prepared to do anything real to stop it happening in the first place.\u201d \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be building a runway at all. That\u2019s the only way. The aviation industry isn\u2019t included in [the UK\u2019s] emissions, therefore the government is able to say \u2018we\u2019re meeting our targets, and actually we\u2019re even going to improve on them\u2019, but it\u2019s because they haven\u2019t included the most important emissions like aviation and shipping.\u201d \u201cWhat we want is a future where profit doesn\u2019t take precedence over the future of our children. It\u2019s an emergency now.\u201d Ms Forbes added: \u201cBy the time the runway is built and ready, I suspect it could be too late. The climate disaster is there to see, and by that time people may say \u2018no, you can\u2019t use it.\u201d  \u201cFile this one under irony\u201d, wrote journalist Joe Lo for  political news website  Left Foot Forward , which first picked up the story. A Heathrow spokesperson told  The Independent : \u201cClimate change is the biggest challenge our generation will face and we are committed to using our scale to find solutions to this issue. Our consultation documents are designed to be open and transparent about the challenges we face and in no way see us complaining about the wider considerations that must be shown towards wider climate change impacts.\u201d \u201cOur focus remains on delivering carbon neutral growth through technology and innovation including cleaner aircraft, improved operations, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon offsetting and airspace modernisation.

Ms Thunberg responded without naming the US president, although it was patently clear who she was referring to. \u201cWe need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserves,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout treating it as a real crisis we cannot solve it.\u201d  Earlier, Ms Thunberg called on world leaders to listen to young activists who have followed her to Davos this year. \u201cI\u2019m not a person that can complain about not being heard,\u201d she said. \u201cThe science and voice of young people is not the centre of the conversation, but it needs to be.\u201d The world\u2019s top scientists have repeatedly warned that immediate action is required to address the climate crisis. With the world experiencing record high temperatures and an increase in the incidence of \u201cextreme\u201d events such as Australia\u2019s wildfires, scientists have called on nations to act to try to limit the rise in global temperature of 1.5C. \u201cWe cannot accept insufficient action anymore,\u201d professor Gail Whiteman, director of the Pentland Centre for Sustainability in Business at Lancaster University, said in a statement. \u201cIf we\u2019re united behind the science then every decision, every investment, every behaviour should be based on what is taking us in the right direction.\u201d Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the world needed to prepare for a surge in refugees, with potentially millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change. \u201cWe must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,\u201d said Filippo Grandi. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t venture to talk about specific numbers, it\u2019s too speculative, but certainly we\u2019re talking about millions here.\u201d Michael Mann, a climate expert and Professor of Earth Sciences at Penn State University, praised Ms Thunberg\u2019s comments. \u201cPlanting trees is a veritable drop in the bucket. We need to solve this problem at its source \u2013 fossil fuels,\u201d he told  The Independent.   \u201cTrump here is doing the bidding of the fossil fuel interests that run his energy and environmental policy, engaging in an effort to deflect attention away from the need to rein in the fossil fuel industry and transition away from the burning of fossil fuels.

Six of those events - unprecedented  wildfires  in the American West, a drought and heatwave across the west and central belt, a  Midwest  derecho, then Hurricanes Sally, Laura and  Isaias  - have all happened in the past three months. The first nine months of 2020 are already tied with the annual record of 16 events that occurred in 2011 and 2017.\u00a0 2020 is also the sixth year in a row where the US has experienced ten or more billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, NCEI reported. As of 7 October, each of the events had losses exceeding $1bn - \u00a0one drought, 11 severe storms, three tropical cyclones, and the wildfires. The disasters have resulted in 188 deaths. Many of the costs are still to be determined, notably in western states where wildfires are still raging and have consumed more than  4 million acres in California  alone since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Delta has strengthened to a category-2 and is forecast to make landfall in Louisiana on Friday. The billion-dollar weather and climate disasters of 2020\u00a0 Fall: Wildfires in California, Oregon, Washington \u00a0 41 Deaths Total Estimated Costs: TBD The wildfires this fall spread rapidly and destroyed several small towns in California, Oregon and Washington. Since mid-August historic wildfires have burned more than 4 million acres in California, more than doubling the statewide record from 2018. Five of the six largest wildfires on record in California burned in the past two months. The August Complex, which began as 37 separate wildfires has now been classified as a \u201cgigafire\u201d after burning through more than a million acres. More than 8,500 structures have been destroyed across California.\u00a0 In Oregon, historic wildfires have burned more than 2,000 structures. Dense wildfire smoke has also produced hazardous air quality affecting millions of people for weeks.\u00a0 Summer-Fall 2020: Western\/Central Drought and Heatwave -Widespread Deaths: TBD Total Estimated Costs: TBD Continuous drought and record heat affected more than a dozen Western and Central states for much of the summer and early fall. Death Valley recorded a temperature of 130F - what is believed to the highest temperature ever record. Los Angeles county recorded a record high of 121F. There may be a significant fatality total resulting from persistent, excessive heat over large population centers. The drought and heat also helped to dry out vegetation across the West that contributed to the Western wildfire potential and severity.  September 2020: Hurricane Sally - Florida Panhandle, Alabama, Georgia 5 Deaths Total Estimated Costs: TBD A category 2 hurricane at landfall with winds up to 100 mph and 20-30 inches of rainfall.The storm caused considerable flood and wind damage across the panhandle of Florida, into Alabama and Georgia. Many homes and businesses in downtown Pensacola, Florida were impacted by storm surge and heavy rainfall. 2020 is now the fourth consecutive year (2017-2020) that the U.S. has been impacted by a slow moving tropical cyclone that produced extreme rainfall and damaging floods, following Harvey, Florence, Imelda and Sally. August 2020: Hurricane Laura - Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas 42 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $14bn The powerful category-4 \u00a0made landfall at Cameron Parish, in southwestern Louisiana bringing winds up to \u00a0150 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet. There was catastrophic damage along the coast as well as inland to the city of Lake Charles. Broken water systems and severely damaged electrical grid in the region will slow the recovery process. Laura also had highest landfall wind speed to impact the US since Hurricane Michael in 2018 August 2020: Derecho - most affected - South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio 4 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $7.5bn A powerful derecho traveled from southeast South Dakota to Ohio, a path of 770 miles in 14 hours producing widespread winds greater than 100 mph. It caused widespread damage to farming operations including millions of acres of corn and soybean crops across central Iowa. There was also severe damage to homes, businesses and vehicles particularly in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In addition, there were 15 tornadoes across northeastern Illinois several affecting Chicago metropolitan area August 2020: Hurricane Isaias - North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania 16 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $4.5bn Isaias made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a category 1, then accelerated up the East Coast. There was also considerable inland flooding particularly in Pennsylvania. In addition, 34 tornadoes developed across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey. Many tornadoes were weaker with scattered damage to agriculture, structures and residences. Isaias also produced several EF-2 tornadoes and one EF-3 tornado that caused damage in coastal North Carolina and Virginia May 2020: Hail storms - South Texas 0 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $1.4bn Golf-ball sized hail pounded several cities. The highest concentration of hail damage to homes, businesses and vehicles occurred across the northern portion of the San Antonio. There was also significant damage east of San Marcos, southeast of Waco and to the west and south of Bryan and College Station May 2020: Thunderstorms, wind, hail and tornadoes - Southern, Central and Eastern states 2 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $1.6 Billion The states most affected included Texas, Illinois and North Carolina with damage to homes, businesses and vehicles. Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.  May 2020: Severe weather - Central and Eastern states including Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee and South Carolina 2 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $2.1bn High winds and hail slammed southern Missouri and western to central Tennessee April 2020: Severe Weather - many Southern states 3 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $1.4bn High winds, hail and tornadoes blasted Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Virginia. The states with the highest damage totals for the event were Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas April 2020: Tornado outbreak - southeast and eastern states 35 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $3.5bn At least 140 tornadoes tore through states from Texas to Maryland. Highly destructive to many homes, vehicles and businesses April 2020: Hail Storms and Severe Weather - Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri 0 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $2.9bn More than 20 tornadoes across southern Indiana and Ohio. Widespread high wind damage to homes, vehicles and businesses in many other surrounding states March 2020: Severe weather - mainly Midwest and Ohio Valley 0 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $2.6bn A combination of high winds and hail blasted Missouri, Ohio and Arkansas. There were also two dozen tornadoes across Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Arkansas causing additional damage March 2020: Tornadoes, severe weather - Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri 25 Deaths Total Estimated Costs: $2.4bn EF-3 and EF-4 tornadoes cause considerable damage across Nashville and several counties to the east. This damage included many homes, businesses, vehicles, 90 planes and numerous buildings at the Nashville airport February 2020: Severe Weather -Many South, East and Northeastern states 3 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $1.3bn More than 20 tornadoes clustered across central Mississippi into Tennessee. High wind damage reports from Florida to New Jersey, with the Carolinas and Florida receiving the most costly damage January 2020: Tornadoes and flooding - many southeastern states 10 deaths Total Estimated Costs: $1.1bn More than 80 tornadoes caused significant damage in the southeast but northern states including Michigan, Wisconsin and New York were also slammed by severe storms. Significant damage occurred along Lake Michigan to roads, the foundation of homes and to Port Milwaukee.

Instead the Commons\u2019 Science and Technology Committee called for a \u201crobust redress mechanism\u201d \u2013 possibly including fines \u2013 in cases where science is misreported by the media. The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), set up by former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson, adopts a \u2018lukewarmist\u2019 stance,  accepting much of climate science  \u2013 apart from the projections for the future. It claims  global warming  will not cause significant problems, while the scientific evidence suggests the planet is on course for a range of possible outcomes with a greater chance of experiencing \u2018dangerous\u2019 weather conditions than avoiding them. The GWPF has repeatedly been accused of misrepresenting the science and cherry-picking findings that appear to fit with its stance on the issue. But in written evidence to the committee, Dr David Whitehouse, a member of the GWPF\u2019s academic advisory council who was making his submission in a personal capacity, tried to make the case that such actions should be allowed in a free society. \u201cSome argue that free speech does not extend to misleading the public by making factually inaccurate statements. But it does,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to speak freely without censorship is fundamental to modern liberal democracies and is guaranteed under national and international law.  \u201cQualifications are made with regard to libel, slander and defamation and, in some countries, holocaust denial.  \u201cThe important point, and it took millennia and many lives to attain it, is that the freedom of speech principle does not mean that you have to be factually accurate.\u201d In a report, the MPs ignored this plea and made it clear they disagreed \u2013 particularly with regards to global warming. They quoted Sir Mark Walport, the Government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser, as saying: \u201cThe climate debate is an example of where people have claimed to be experts who are not.\u201d The committee also highlighted evidence given by Imperial College London about the \u201ccontinuing problem of misapplied \u2018balance\u2019 in the media\u2019s science reporting\u201d. And the MPs' report added: \u201cThe Government should ensure that a robust redress mechanism is provided for when science is misreported.\" Kira Morris Hira Ali  Sandra Rondon Probal Rashid Rizwan Dharejo  Tom Schifanella Abrar Hossain Riddhima Singh Bhati  Leung Ka Wa  Mahtuf Ikhsan Ministers should still weigh the importance of scientific evidence but \u201cwhere they do not follow the results they must ensure that they do not dismiss or discredit legitimate scientific evidence\u201d, the report said.  In an age of claim and counter-claim about \u2018fake news\u2019, spin and misinformation about science risked causing real harm, warned Stephen Metcalfe MP, who chairs the committee. \u201cRobust consideration of scientific evidence is crucial to policy making and really affects our daily lives and we have seen over many years through the debates around BSE [\u2018mad cow disease\u2019], climate change, [vaccine] MMR and new medical treatments,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever too often the clever practice of communications overshadows the true advice of experts, and the public are left bewildered, and not knowing who to believe. \u201cThis affects Government policy too, Ministers and decision makers must take greater care to set out exactly how scientific evidence is being considered, and ensure they cannot be accused of discrediting or skewing the evidence for financial reasons or to suit political aims. \u201cReporting scientific and particularly health issues accurately is also a big responsibility for media organisations if they are to retain public trust, and we need to give the public greater reassurances that they are being properly informed and engaged.\u201d * Update. This article has been amended to make clear that Dr David Whitehouse was submitting evidence to the Commons' Science & Technology Committee in a personal capacity, rather than on behalf of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, of which he is a member. 26\/4\/17 Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

Despite such promises, many countries are still not on track. Some of the globe\u2019s biggest emitters \u2013 the  US  and  Russia  \u2013 have either left or not yet ratified the treaty.

Mr Trump has often pursued the interests of industries such as  coal  and car manufacturing at the expense of the environment in his pursuit of jobs growth. In 2017  he also announced  the US will drop out of the  Paris Agreement  and its commitment to reduce emissions. Since taking office, Mr Trump has  lifted restrictions  on coal plants emissions and approved permits for the huge  Keystone XL oil pipeline . He has rolled back the Obama administration\u2019s  pollution standards  for vehicles,  even taking on California  for wanting to impose their own separate \u2013 tougher \u2013 ones.  The last two heads of the Environmental Protection Agency that have carried these changes.  Andrew Wheeler , the current boss, was  a former coal lobbyist .  Scott Pruitt , his predecessor, opposed environmental regulations.  Justin Trudeau  is a vocal proponent for fighting climate change, celebrating the  introduction of a carbon tax  in 2018 with the tweet: \u201cStarting next spring, it\u2019ll no longer be free to pollute in Canada.\u201d  However, he has faced criticism for another commitment: breathing life into  Canada \u2018s oil industry. As he once put it: \u201cNo country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there.\u201d Indeed, the day after the government declared a climate emergency this summer, it approved a multibillion dollar oil pipeline expansion.  However, Mr Trudeau vowed that profits from the  Trans Mountain  pipeline would be funnelled into green projects.  If all  EU \u2019s environmental policies were fully enacted,  Climate Action Tracker (CAT) estimates it would exceed the current target , which aims to reduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2020.  New targets  bind countries to work towards 32 per cent of its overall energy coming from renewable sources by 2030 (although individual targets of countries differ).  Other schemes  reduce CO2 emissions for new cars and emissions from factories and power plants, for example, through the largest greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world.  However,  according to  National Georgraphic , despite all these positive steps, and perhaps because of its size and scope, the EU remains the third largest emitter of CO2 in the world.  The fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the world has seemingly had a change of heart recently when it comes to climate change. Having previously signed but not ratified the Paris Agreement, the final step may finally come by the end of 2019.  In addition to this,  Russia  is moving to regulate its emissions for the first time and to impose a carbon tax.  Previously,  Vladimir Putin  did not seem very concerned about climate change, even suggesting parts of Russia might benefit from rising temperatures and that Russians would save money on fur coats, as  The Economist  reported .  He recently expressed a dislike of  wind turbines , which harm birds and, apparently, worms according to the Russian leader. \u201cThey shake, causing worms to come out of the soil,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a joke.\u201d Similarly,  China \u2019s attitude to climate change has drastically altered over the last decade, before which it viewed environmental policies as a western conspiracy plotting to curb its growth, as  the  Financial Times  pointed out .  Since 2015, there have been strict environmental regulations for power plants and a drive to reduce  air pollution .  China has also given its growing electric car manufacturing industry a boost with large subsidies. In turn,  Chinese people bought 1.1 million electric cars in 2018  \u2013 more than the entire world combined.  However, largely due to heavy coal consumption and electricity production, emissions have been rising for the past two years, whereas they were previously stagnant or falling, according to a report by  Carbon Brief .  One bright note, China\u2019s capital of  Beijing  is on track to drop out from the list of the world\u2019s top 200 most-polluted cities this year, with hazardous smog concentrations falling to their lowest on record in August,  data compiled by IQAir AirVisual . This year,  the UK declared a climate emergency  after  protesters  made themselves heard by flooding London\u2019s streets.  Just before she left office former prime minister  Theresa May  set  a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 , although this has been called highly optimistic given the lack of follow-up action. Britain\u2019s biggest environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace,  urged chancellor Sajid Javid  to invest at least \u00a342bn to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 which is far off the current \u00a317bn a year spent.  A report  by the Commons Science and Technology Committee found the current practices of fracking, reducing subsidies on renewable energy and opposing wind farms are also  restricting Britain\u2019s ability to fulfil its pledge .  Brazil \u2019s president  Jair Bolsonaro  recently endured the wrath of  France \u2019s leader,  Emmanuel Macron , for having allegedly \u201clied\u201d to him about his commitment to tackling climate change.  In fact, the country\u2019s failure to protect its Amazon rainforest, which is hugely important for capturing emissions, was impossible to miss as it was  engulfed by recent forest fires .  Mr Bolsonaro  defunded agencies protecting it from deforestation  and his government even planned to fund construction projects across the world largest rainforest,  leaked documents show .  During his presidential campaign, he blamed environmental regulations for holding back Brazil.  And, with the Ministry of Environment\u2019s budget for tackling climate change slashed by 95 per cent,  according to CAT , Brazil does not look likely to lead the fight against the global crisis anytime soon.  Reuters AFP\/Getty EPA AFP\/Getty AFP AP AFP\/Getty AP Reuters EPA Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters Reuters AP AFP\/Getty Reuters Reuters AFP\/Getty Reuters EPA AFP\/Getty AFP\/Getty EPA To mark the climate change strikes which united the globe today, Australian academics sent a damaging  open letter  to their government. \u201cAustralia\u2019s current climate policies and practices are dire,\u201d it read.  The government has been accused of both propping up and encouraging the expansion of its coal industry.  In turn,  CAT predicts  it will fall well short of its targets set by the Paris Agreement, estimating a 8 per cent increase above its 2005 fossil fuel and industry emission levels as opposed to the desired 14 to 17 per cent decrease. In line with the academics, CAT accuses  Australia  of having \u201cturned its back on global climate action\u201d.

Satellite pictures for the 2022 Earth Day Google doodle reveal melting glaciers, deforestation and coral bleaching in the past few decades.  Stark shots of Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, between December 1986 and 2020 show glacial retreat at the summit.  Images taken each December annually from 1986 to 2020 show glacier retreat at the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro  The melting of glaciers in Seremersooq, Greenland, can also be seen pictured in the two decades up until 2020.  Glacier retreat is the biggest cause of sea-level rise in recent decades and is the \u201cmost dramatic evidence\u201d of global warming, according to climate.gov. Timelapse pictures showing impact of climate change in Seremersooq, Greenland  The doodle also features satellite images which show coral bleaching on Lizard Island, Australia. The Great Barrier Reef went through its sixth mass bleaching event in March. Aerial surveys showed that no reefs across a 1,200km stretch escaped the heat. According to WWF, scientists predict that we could lose over 90 per cent of our coral reefs by 2050 if we don\u2019t act urgently to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Images taken each month from March to May 2016 show coral bleaching on Lizard Island, Australia Significant levels of deforestation can be seen in the last doodle featured on the search engine.  A timelapse of the declining trees in the Harz Forests in Elend, Germany between December 1995 to 2020 is shown, with Google writing that the forests have been \u201cdestroyed by bark beetle infestation due to rising temperatures and severe drought\u201d.  Images taken each December annually from 1995 to 2020 show deforestation in the Harz Forests in Elend, Germany  According to Global Forest Watch, Harz suffered a 30 per cent decrease in tree cover since 2000.  This year, Earth Day - a global annual event intended to prompt discussion and action around environmental causes - comes after the release of the latest IPCC reports showing that the world is barrelling towards  stronger, more frequent disasters  fuelled by the climate crisis , with  little time to reverse course .

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Hollywood 's response to climate change includes donations, protests and other activism. but it's apparently missing out on an approach close to home. Only a sliver of screen fiction, 2.8 per cent, refers to climate change-related words, according to a new study of 37,453 film and TV scripts from 2016-20. A blueprint for ways to turn that around was released on Tuesday (19 April).  \u201cGood Energy: A Playbook for Screenwriting in the Age of Climate Change\u201d was created with feedback from more than 100 film and TV writers, said Anna Jane Joyner, editor-in-chief of the playbook and founder of Good Energy, a nonprofit consultancy. \u201cA big hurdle that we encountered was that writers were associating climate stories with apocalypse stories,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe main purpose of the playbook is to expand that menu of possibilities....to a larger array of how it would be showing up in our real life.\u201d Among those who provided funding for the playbook project are Bloomberg Philanthropies, Sierra Club and the Walton Family Foundation. Waves  of celebrities have been sounding the climate alarm, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Don Cheadle and Shailene Woodley. DiCaprio also starred in  Don't Look Up , the 2021 Oscar-nominated film in which a comet hurtling toward an indifferent  Earth  is a metaphor for the peril of climate-change apathy. Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio in \u2018Don\u2019t Look Up' But the playbook is asking writers and industry executives to consider a variety of less-dire approaches, Joyner said, with examples and resources included. \u201cWe describe it as a spectrum, everything from showing the impact with solutions in the background,\u201d such as including solar panels in an exterior shot of a building, she said. Casual mentions of climate change in scenes also can be effective. \u201cIf you\u2019re already attached to a character in a story and it authentically comes up in conversation for the character, it validates for the audience that it\u2019s OK to talk about in your day-to-day lives,\u201d Joyner said. Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video  Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Dorothy Fortenberry, a TV writer (\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d) and playwright, said the industry needs to broaden its view of who it writes about, not just what. \u201cClimate change is something that right now is affecting people who aren't necessarily the people that Hollywood tends to write stories about. It's affecting farmers in Bangladesh, farmers in Peru, farmers in Kentucky,\u201d Fortenberry said. \u201cIf we told stories about different kinds of people, there would be opportunities to seamlessly weave climate in.\u201d The entertainment industry\u2019s failure to use its storytelling powers more effectively on the issue seems unsurprising to Joyner, who's been working on climate-change communications in various sectors and communities for 15 years. For the first decade, it felt like \u201cscreaming into the void\u201d because of the lack of response, Joyner said. But there is evidence of increasing concern among  Americans  regarding climate change, she said, including those who are in Hollywood. \u201cWe've all gone through a kind of awakening,\u201d she said. There are a number of documentaries and news programs about climate change, she said, expressing optimism that fiction creators will make steady progress. Good Energy funded the script analysis by the Norman Lear Center\u2019s Media Impact Project at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.  As part of the study that's yet to be released in full, researchers checked for references to 36 key words and phrases including \u201cclimate change,\u201d \u201cfracking\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d in TV episodes and movies released in the U.S. market.

Adults hear terms like \u201c carbon emissions \u201d, \u201c greenhouse gas \u201d and \u201c renewable energy \u201d every day but may not consider what children, who perhaps don\u2019t have a fully-formed idea of what those concepts are, actually understand about them. Organisations like  Extinction Rebellion  and individual activists such as  Greta Thunberg  may have become household names by fighting to raise awareness of the issues and promote change but it\u2019s still important to arm our children with the information they need to help the planet without frightening them. Megan Kennedy-Woodard, coaching psychologist and co-director of  Climate Psychologist , told  The Independent : \u201cWe should absolutely not avoid difficult conversations \u2013 anxiety loves avoidance. The conversation is, fortunately, all around us now. We don\u2019t want to teach denial, we want to teach resilience.\u201d Here are some useful and practical tips in approaching the subject with children: When discussing such a big concept with a young child, it\u2019s important to do it at a time when both the adult and child are free from distractions to allow time for a meaningful discussion to take place. Ms Kennedy-Woodard says: \u201cPick a time that you normally communicate with ease, for example, whilst cooking or walking, and probably not before bed or an exam,\u201d adding: \u201cIf it\u2019s not resonating, don\u2019t push it. You can try again another time.\u201d She also suggests it\u2019s important to end the conversation by doing something fun afterwards, like a nature walk. We all know children like to ask  millions  of questions about any given topic.  For one as complex and scientific as the climate crisis, it\u2019s useful to know the basics: Ms Kennedy-Woodard adds: \u201cHave clear, age-appropriate facts in mind but remember you do not need to be a climate scientist to talk about the climate crisis. \u201cYou can always say, \u2018That\u2019s a great question, let me research that for you.\u2019\u201d She recommends the excellent resources that can be found at  National Geographic Kids  and  Nasa . Rather than getting bogged down in the science, explain how the climate crisis has a real-world effect, as  studies  suggest having empathy with nature increases our concern for environmental issues. You can do this by explaining the effect it\u2019s having on a particular species and its habitat.  For example, warmer temperatures are melting sea ice in the Arctic at a faster rate, negatively impacting mammals such as polar bears that rely on the ice to hunt for their food. There is a danger, with a topic like this, that things could get a bit doom-and-gloom and cause unnecessary anxiety. So it\u2019s important to reassure children that there are things that we can do on an individual level to slow down the rate of  global warming . Ms Kennedy-Woodard explains the rule of three can be useful in this situation: \u201cFor every difficult fact you present, have three balancing positive facts or stories to maintain hope and inspire action.\u201d Highlight examples such as how walking or cycling rather than taking a car can have a positive impact. And how recycling waste so that it doesn\u2019t end up having to be buried in a landfill site can also help. Planting trees and flowers not only absorbs greenhouse gases but provides a habitat for wildlife. It also helps a child develop an emotional bond with the natural world. Research  suggests habits in children are rooted by the age of nine \u2013 these small steps will not only form great habits for the future but will empower children to know they are doing their bit for the planet. Talk of the climate crisis can feel heavy, weighty and overwhelming. \u201cClimate anxiety\u201d is a growing area of work for psychologists but equally it is not a topic to try and shelter children from. The topic will appear regularly in the media and at school so children will hear about it at some point. It\u2019s important to face the issue head-on to avoid any unnecessary anxiety and to correct any misinformation they may have obtained. If they do feel worried, Ms Kennedy-Woodard suggests: \u201cTell them you hear that they feel scared, angry or worried. Talk about how you feel but don\u2019t put your emotions on your kids.\u201d She suggests that by empathising, we can help alleviate their stress. For example, you might reply: \u201cSometimes I worry about the planet so I decide to do my part by biking, or switching our electricity or cutting back on meat.\u201d Megan Kennedy-Woodard's book  Turn the Tide on Climate Anxiety: Sustainable Action for Your Mental Health and the Planet  was published in January 2022 and is available now.

To name a few.  Now,  New York City \u2019s most iconic green space will also function as a  laboratory , providing what researchers hope to be valuable insights into adapting  urban parks  to the challenges of  climate change . Parks play a vital role in happiness and wellbeing,  research shows , but New York parks are particularly important to the city\u2019s population. Half of New Yorkers say that the only time they spend in nature is in city parks.  City parks also play a vital role in fighting climate change. By 2050, more than two-thirds of the global population is expected to live in urban areas and the latest report from the UN\u2019s  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  found that making cities more green could have huge potential in reducing heat-trapping emissions. But the million acres of urban parks in the US and their tree canopies, plants, and wildlife are facing increasing threats from hotter temperatures and more extreme weather including unprecedented rainfall and more powerful storms.  Central Park has been impacted by some of the more severe effects of climate change in the past ten years, so offers a unique place to study. Last September 1, Hurricane Ida dropped a record 3.15 inches of rain on Central Park in one hour, beating a record set just 10 days prior. Areas of the park were left flooded including the Bethesda Fountain.  Harmful algal blooms have sprung up in the park\u2019s water bodies due to a combination of hotter temperatures, a rise in pollution, and a build-up of nutrients in run-off. The city experienced the hottest July on record in 2021. Three heat waves \u2013 including 17 days that exceeded 90 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 showed why a healthy tree canopy was so important for providing much needed shade.  Currently, there\u2019s no consolidated information or policy recommendations to help cities manage and protect their parks from climate-linked threats.  The Central Park Climate Lab, created by the park\u2019s conservancy along with the Yale School of the Environment, and the Natural Areas Conservancy, aims to provide new research and adaptation tools. The lab team will use satellite data and on-the-ground research to explore changes in seasonal patterns and how plant and animal life respond to shifting weather. Researchers also want to better understand how effective city parks are at carbon sequestration \u2013 the process of capturing and storing planet-heating CO2 emissions from the atmosphere \u2013 and how much cooling the park has on the \u201curban heat island\u201d, meaning how trees and plants can counter the absorbed heat of concrete, glass and stainless steel of buildings. \u201cParks are essential for New Yorkers, as this last couple of years have proven, but flooding, high winds, and extreme temperatures pose a threat to their health,\u201d said NYC Mayor  Eric Adams . He added that the Central Park Climate Lab \u201c will be a model for urban parks across the country\u201d.

Analysis led by Australian scientists examined the impact of pledges of action\u00a0to curb emissions up to 2030, and over the long term, made by countries and sectors before the end of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. The computer modelling study found that if all the commitments are delivered on, temperature rises could be limited to a peak of 1.9C to 2C. But the paper, published in the journal Nature , warns that more urgently needs to be done to curb warming to the limits that countries agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Long-term targets should be treated with scepticism if they are not supported by short-term commitments to put countries on a pathway to meet those targets in the next decade The pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions made up to the end of the Cop26 talks provide only a 6-10% chance of curbing warming to 1.5C. The world is already seeing increasing floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires as a result of climate change, and beyond 1.5C of warming, more extreme weather, crop damage and losses of key systems such as coral reefs are expected. Limiting warming not only to \u201cjust below\u201d 2C but to the Paris targets of \u201cwell below\u201d 2C or to 1.5C \u201curgently requires policies and actions to bring about steep emission reductions this decade\u201d aligned with bringing global carbon emissions down to zero overall \u2013 net zero \u2013 by mid century, the scientists warn. The paper looked at new or updated commitments for action in the next decade that had been submitted by the end of the Cop26 summit, under a \u201cratchet\u201d process in the Paris treaty to increase ambition to drive down fossil fuel emissions and other pollution causing climate change. The study also included long-term pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 or later. \u201cOur results provide a reason to be optimistic: warming could be limited to 2C or just below, if the pledges on the table are implemented in full and on time. \u201cPeaking of global greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved this decade. But our results also provide a sobering assessment of how far current pledges are from limiting warming to 1.5C,\u201d the scientists write. The findings from the scientists are in line with analysis by independent analysts Climate Action Tracker (CAT) released in Glasgow in November which found that under the most optimistic scenario, temperatures could peak at 1.8C. But CAT experts warned that analysis looking at policies which governments are currently implementing puts warming at 2.7C over the long term. And in a commentary piece also published in the journal Nature, experts said the commitments could ensure global warming does not exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels before 2100, but only if backed up by short-term policies. Writing in the journal, US scientists Zeke Hausfather and Frances C Moore said: \u201cIt is easy to set ambitious climate targets for 30, 40 or even 50 years in\u00a0the future \u2014 but it is much harder to enact policies today that shift energy systems towards a more sustainable future. \u201cLong-term targets should be treated with scepticism if they are not supported by short-term commitments to put countries on a pathway to meet those targets in the next decade.\u201d They warned there was no guarantee that countries would meet their 2030 pledges \u2013 and said the target to curb warming to 1.5C was slipping out of reach, with temperatures already around 1.2C above pre-industrial levels.

But new research reveals great whites are now having to adapt again, this time to major changes caused by humans, as anthropogenic emissions push up temperatures and warm oceans. A new study into \u201cunprecedented\u201d sightings of juvenile great white sharks at the northern end of Monterey Bay, south of San Francisco on the Pacific coast indicates a significant northward expansion in the young sharks \u2019 range - about 600km (370 miles) northwards since 2014. The researchers from Monterey Bay Aquarium have said their work revealing this range shift indicates the young sharks are being subjected to a loss of suitable thermal habitat as water temperatures within their preferred temperature range are becoming harder to find. \u201cNature has many ways to tell us the status quo is being disrupted, but it's up to us to listen,\u201d said Monterey Bay Aquarium chief scientist Dr Kyle Van Houtan.\u00a0 \u201cThese sharks - by venturing into territory where they have not historically been found - are telling us how the ocean is being affected by climate change.\u201d The sharks' movement north has also had a dramatic impact on the sea otters which live at the top of the bay. The aquarium scientists and their research partners began using electronic tags to learn about juvenile great white sharks\u2019 habits and movements in southern California two decades ago. The tags revealed that when a dramatic heatwave in the north Pacific hit the California coast between 2014-2016, unusual sightings of juvenile great white sharks began to be recorded in central California waters near Aptos, California.\u00a0 This is further north than young great white sharks had ever been seen before, as the animals had historically remained in the warmer waters of the southern California Current. Water temperature in the Aptos area averages about 13C, but temperature extremes have become more common since the heatwave hit, rising as high as 21C in August 2020. The research team analysed 22 million electronic data records from the tags of 14 sharks and then compared this to 38 years of ocean temperatures to map the cold edge of the animals\u2019 thermal preferences, or \u201cniche\u201d. The study charts the significant northward shift in the young white sharks\u2019 range. Between 1982 and 2013, the northernmost edge of the juveniles\u2019 range was near Santa Barbara (34\u00b0 N). But just after the marine heatwave, their range shifted dramatically north to Bodega Bay (38.5\u00b0 N). Since then with slightly cooler waters, the young sharks\u2019 range limit has come down again and now hovers near Monterey (36\u00b0 N). \u201cAfter studying juvenile white shark behaviour and movements in southern California for the last 16 years, it is very interesting to see this northerly shift in nursery habitat use,\" said Dr Chris Lowe, a co-author of the study and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach.\u00a0 \u201cI think this is what many biologists have expected to see as the result of climate change and rising ocean temperatures.\u00a0 \u201cFrankly, I'll be surprised if we don't see this northerly shift across more species.\u201d Scientists Kevin Weng (left) of the University of Hawaii, John O\u2019Sullivan (centre) of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Chris Lowe (right) of California State University Long Beach tag a young great white shark off Southern California Though the northwards expansion of the great whites may not have come as a complete surprise, the relatively rapid shift in the sharks\u2019 habits meant the researchers turned to novel sources of data such as community science and recreational fishing records to document this northward movement of the population as accurately as possible. \u201cThis study would not have been possible without contributions from our community scientists and treasured Aquarium volunteers,\u201d said Dr Van Houtan.\u00a0 \u201cEric Mailander, a local firefighter, provided a decade of detailed logbook records of shark sightings, and volunteer Carol Galginaitis transcribed those hand-written data into an electronic database.\u201d The researchers said their study reinforces what scientists have been warning for years: that major changes in the natural world are revealing the impacts of the climate crisis . \u201cWhite sharks, otters, kelp, lobsters, corals, redwoods, monarch butterflies - these are all showing us that climate change is happening right here in our backyard,\" said Dr Van Houtan.\u00a0 \u201cIt's time for us to take notice and listen to this chorus from nature. We know that greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly disrupting our climate and this is taking hold in many ways.\u00a0 \u201cOur study showed one example of juvenile white sharks appearing in Monterey Bay. But let's be clear: The sharks are not the problem. Our emissions are the problem. We need to act on climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\u201d The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports . Interested in learning more about the Climate Crisis?

All rights reserved. Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved As climate change bakes the planet, dozens of nations and many local governments are putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions that are increasing flooding, droughts and other costly catastrophes. Pennsylvania on Saturday becomes the first major fossil fuel-producing state in the U.S. to adopt a carbon pricing policy to address climate change. It joins 11 states where coal, oil and natural gas power plants must buy credits for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit. President Joe Biden is attempting a less direct approach \u2014 known as the social cost of carbon \u2014 that calculates future climate damages to justify tougher restrictions on polluting industries. Republicans say that could crush many businesses. They want the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the administration after lower courts in Louisiana and Missouri split on the issue. Governments elsewhere have moved more aggressively. Canada, for example, imposes fuel charges on individuals and also makes big polluters pay for emissions. It's one of 27 nations with some kind of carbon tax, according to The World Bank. The varied strategies come as scientists warn climate change is accelerating \u2014 and all can help reduce emissions. But experts say U.S. efforts have been hobbled by its fractured approach. \u201cPart of the reason you need all of these things to work in tandem is we do not have a federal climate policy,\" said Seth Blumsack, director of the Center for Energy Law and Policy at Penn State University. \u201cWe have social cost of carbon used in regulatory decisions but not (a carbon price) that is faced by the market.\u201d SO WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG? It varies. A lot. The Biden administration's social cost estimate is about $51, meaning every ton of carbon dioxide spewed from a power plant or tail pipe today is projected to contribute to $51 in economic damages in coming years. The state of New York has its own social cost of carbon, updated in 2020 to $125 a ton to account for economic trends. By contrast, emissions were most recently valued at $13.50 per ton at auction under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast, which Pennsylvania is joining. A similar \u201ccap and trade\u201d emissions program is in place in California, and one is due to go into effect in Washington state in 2023. Canada's carbon taxes include a minimum fuel charge for individuals equivalent to about $40 per ton. WHY THE BIG DIFFERENCES? The social cost of carbon attempts to capture the value of all climate damage, centuries into the future. Carbon pricing reflects how much companies are willing to pay today for a limited amount of emission credits offered at auction. In other words, the social cost of carbon guides policy, while carbon pricing represents policy in practice. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get the price to reflect the true cost to society,\u201d said economist Matthew Kotchen, a former U.S. Treasury Department official now at Yale University. \u201cA more stringent policy would have a higher carbon price. A more lax policy would give you a lower carbon price.\u201d In the most efficient world, economists say the two figures would line up, meaning there would be agreement about what climate change damages will cost and the policies used to address them. IS ANY OF THIS WORKING? Emissions from northeastern states would have been about 24% higher if the carbon pricing consortium hadn't been in place, according to researchers from Duke University and the Colorado School of Mines. The carbon auctions also have brought in almost $5 billion that can be used to reduce household energy cost increases and promote renewable energy. The consortium began in 2009 \u2014 the year of a failed push in Congress to establish a nationwide cap and trade program. The bipartisan proposal died amid arguments over cost and whether climate change was even occurring. Following lawsuits from environmentalists, President Barack Obama 's administration crafted the social cost of carbon and began including future damage estimates in cost-benefit analyses for new regulations. It was used under Obama more than 80 times, including for tightened vehicle emissions standards and regulations aimed at shuttering coal plants. President Donald Trump moved to roll back many of the Obama-era rules \u2014 and to help justify the changes, the Republican administration cut the social cost of carbon from about $50 per ton to $7 or less. The lower number included only domestic climate impacts and not global damages. \u201cOn its face that might sound okay, but when you think about it, global harms from climate change have implications in the U.S. in terms of the global financial system,\u201d said Romany Webb, a climate change law expert at Columbia Law School. WHAT'S NEXT? On the day Biden took office, he set up an interagency group that revived the Obama estimate and promised a revised figure incorporating previously overlooked consequences of climate change. Many economists expect the revised figure to be higher, perhaps more than double the current $51. Without a nationwide cap and trade program, environmentalists and some economists want the government to be more aggressive in using the social cost of carbon to overhaul government energy policy. Under Biden, the U.S. Interior Department for the first time is applying climate damage considerations to oil and gas sales on public lands and waters. An upcoming lease sale in Wyoming, for example, could result in future emissions of 34 million tons (31 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide. That\u2019s equivalent to more than $1.5 billion in future damages. But the agency still plans to sell the leases because officials said there were no \u201cestablished thresholds\u201d to evaluate whether the increased emissions were acceptable, or not. The expansion of carbon pricing into Pennsylvania remains tenuous. A legal challenge is pending and the state's term-limited Democratic governor could soon be replaced by a successor who opposes the state's participation. \u201cWhile pricing carbon would be the gold standard, it seems politically difficult to actually get there,\u201d said Brian Prest with Resources for the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. \u2014- Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @matthewbrownAP Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The opinion paper published this week is the first time researchers have demonstrated that climate change affects interactions between organisms in different realms in similar patterns. Chemical communication plays an essential role in ecosystems, enabling organisms to mate and interact with each other; locate predators, food and habitats; and sense their environment. The opinion paper shows the extent to which alterations in temperature, carbon dioxide and pH levels \u2013 that are created as a result of climate change \u2013 can affect every step of this fundamental way that organisms communicate with each other. These chemical communication processes regulate interactions in the Earth\u2019s ecosystems and are essential to our environment. Dr Christina C Roggatz, Research Fellow in Marine Chemical Ecology at the University of Hull and lead author of the paper, said: \u201cThis paper is a wake-up call. We are heavily reliant on the Earth\u2019s ecosystems and the chemical communications that regulate them. Globally changing climate and water chemistry are causing acidification threats that may disturb chemical information exchange among freshwater and marine organisms \u201cThe predominantly negative effects that climate change has upon the language of life within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems could have a range of far-reaching implications for the future of our planet and human wellbeing, for example by impacting food security and fundamental ecosystem services that make our planet habitable.\u201d Published today in the Global Change Biology journal, the paper \u201cBecoming nose-blind \u2013 climate change impacts on chemical communication\u201d was co-authored by the University of Hull, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, the Universite de Liege and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH \u2013 UFZ. It is an overview of existing evidence and insight across marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Dr Patrick Fink, co-author and Research Group Leader at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, said: \u201cChemical communication is the ubiquitous language of life on earth \u2013 but this is being jeopardised by global change. \u201cThere\u2019s no talking with words for life under water, so aquatic organisms \u2018talk\u2019 in chemical signals. \u201cBut this fine-tuned \u2018language\u2019 is in peril. Globally changing climate and water chemistry are causing acidification threats that may disturb chemical information exchange among freshwater and marine organisms.\u201d The authors also call for a systematic, universal framework approach to address highlighted knowledge gaps. Dr Roggatz said: \u201cAlthough a growing number of studies suggest that climate change-associated stressors cause adverse effects on the communication between organisms, knowledge of the underlying mechanisms remains scarce. \u201cWe urgently need a systematic approach to be able to compare results and fully understand the potentially disruptive impact that climate change is having upon each step of this fundamental communication process. Understanding this means we are better equipped to predict and protect the future of our planet.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in As the water levels drop to record lows and long-frozen ice starts to melt, relics from history are coming to the surface Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Last week, boaters on Lake Mead stumbled upon the remains of a human body in a barrel. The body is believed to be a murder victim from the 1970s or \u201980s, which the Las Vegas Police Department assessed based on the individual\u2019s clothing. But the sudden re-emergence of a decades-old crime wasn\u2019t the strangest part of the story \u2013 rather, it was that the barrel probably only surfaced because of the historically low water levels in the lake. Water levels in Lake Mead, which pools behind the Hoover Dam along the border of Nevada and Arizona, are now at just 31 per cent of full capacity \u2013 a record low, and a result of the 20-year megadrought that has crippled the American west. Drought in the western US has been exacerbated by the climate crisis and will likely get worse in the coming decades \u2014 in addition to all the melting ice, stronger storms, and intense heatwaves that the new climatic conditions will bring. And around the world, these changing conditions are unearthing parts of the past that have been hidden for tens \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 of years. Pallets note where human remains were recently found on the shore of Lake Mead as the water level drops to unprecedented lows, a result of years-long drought Last year, workers testing imaging equipment at Folsom Lake outside Sacramento stumbled upon an old plane at the bottom of waters. While the plane was initially believed to be wreckage from a 1965 crash that killed four people, it was later determined to be the wreckage of a 1986 plane crash with no fatalities. It\u2019s possible that these remnants became visible to the imaging equipment due to the lake\u2019s extraordinarily low water levels as a result of California\u2019s ongoing drought \u2014 around the time the plane was spotted, the lake was at just 34 per cent of its total capacity. On the other side of the world, warmer temperatures are causing ice and snow to melt in Mongolia \u2014 revealing long-hidden remnants of distant eras. Scientists have found rope, arrowheads and even leftover animals parts from long-passed hunts as the ice recedes. These artifacts can offer archaeologists new information about human life in these eras, but scientists also warn that as these items are exposed to the elements, valuable historic information could be lost. It\u2019s not just ancient human life coming to the surface as ice melts. As permafrost and glaciers melt, the remains of animals from the last Ice Age are also coming to light. In Russia, people have found preserved parts of mammoths and wooly rhinos \u2014 two species extinct for thousands of years. And in northern Canada, researchers found the remains of a wolf pup who died around 57,000 years ago, near the end of the Pleistocene era. Often, these long-gone animals are extraordinarily intact, having been frozen in time by the preservative effects of a deep freeze for thousands of years. The wolf pup, for example, still had clear fur and skin visible, along with teeth and bones. Back in Lake Mead, water levels dropped low enough last month to reveal an intake pipe for a pumping station supplying Las Vegas with water \u2014 leaving it unable to drain water to the city. The Southern Nevada Water Authority, the local water agency, completed construction on a new pumping station in 2020 \u2014 called the \u201clow lake level pumping station\u201d \u2014 with a much deeper intake pipe in anticipation of this scenario. The new pumping station began operation last month as the higher valve emerged above the water\u2019s surface. As ice melts in Europe\u2019s tallest peaks, people who disappeared in the mountains decades ago are being found. In 2017, the remains of a Swiss couple who died in 1942 were discovered near a melting glacier . Newspapers, as well as potential human remains, from a mid-century plane crash have also been discovered near the melting Mont Blanc in the French Alps. And in the Italian Alps, melting ice has revealed a long-lost cave filled with supplies used by Austrian soldiers in World War I. As the climate crisis continues, water levels could continue to drop, and ice could continue to melt \u2014 meaning there may be more discoveries revealed in the future. A few of these revelations might also be more dangerous than others. Some scientists are worried that as permafrost in the Arctic melts, it could release pathogens not seen for years, threatening both people and wildlife. For example, in 2016, a heatwave may have been responsible for an anthrax outbreak in Siberia, as a decades-dead reindeer carcass unthawed and released the bacteria, killing one child and hospitalizing numerous others \u2014 as well as over 1,000 reindeer. And in Lake Mead, officials suggested to KLAS-TV that the recent homicide victim discovery may not be the last homicide victim to reappear as water levels drop to unprecedented lows.

The 3D visualisation of central Dublin shows that more than 8,500 buildings could be flooded to an average depth of 1.7 meters by the end of the century if no further action is taken to mitigate the risks of global heating. The buildings and areas expected to be damaged by coastal flooding also include hotels and Dublin\u2019s financial district, according to the analysis by Cervest , a tech company that assesses the potential climate risk to the assets of businesses, governments and NGOs such as factories and offices. The data visualisation was released on Thursday to coincide with the start of the Dublin Climate Summit \u2013 of which The Independent is a media partner. Cervest said its visualisation demonstrates the devastating consequences in store for cityscapes and infrastructure if nothing is done to combat global heating and warned that the physical damage will have knock-on social and economic impacts. What\u2019s more, the analysis only considers the risk associated with coastal flooding. When other climate risks are factored in \u2013 such as extreme heat and wind stress \u2013 increasingly large areas of Dublin will be affected, according to Cervest\u2019s data visualisation team. If mitigation policies are applied soon \u2013 such as implementing national emissions reduction commitments and deforestation pledges \u2013 this scenario might change, the visualisation team said. However, they warned that some damages were now inevitable. \u201cEven if we reach net zero tomorrow, physical risk is already locked into our system due to past actions,\u201d the team said in a statement alongside the visualisation. Globally, the company said physical assets worth more than \u00a32 trillion are already at risk from climate change, and economic losses associated with global heating are expected to rise to \u00a318.7 trillion by 2050. Cervest founder and CEO Iggy Bassi said the company\u2019s insights can be used to pinpoint vulnerabilities and inform decisions. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a climate scientist to understand this powerful image,\u201d he said. \u201cMy city is going to look like this \u2026 unless we take action.\u201d Earlier this week the World Meteorological Organisation issued a new update warning that there was now a 50\/50 chance the global temperature will temporarily reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next five years. The world has already warmed by 1.1C since the temperatures recorded before the industrial revolution, so reaching 1.5C is only 0.4C away. Even temporarily exceeding 1.5C would be a significant moment because the 2015 Paris Agreement aimed to keep the average temperature to no more than 1.5C higher than pre-industrial times, in order to prevent the worst damage from climate change. Exceeding the 1.5C threshold for one year does not mean the Paris accord has been broken because the Paris target refers to the average temperature and excludes year-on-year natural variability. Nevertheless, climate experts said the update showed how fast the world was approaching this target, which will likely lead to even more harm to lives and livelihoods as extreme weather events, such as flooding, become more frequent and severe. Last month, The Independent revealed which areas of Britain would be most at risk from non-coastal flooding by 2050 due to the climate crisis. They included Cardiff, Windsor and parts of London.

Temperatures are reaching 50C in parts of the world. We\u2019ve heard reports of 195 \u201c carbon bombs\u201d from the fossil fuel industry, each set to unleash a billion tonnes of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Prince Charles, then \u2013 such an ardent advocate for environmental action \u2013 must have been scanning the pages of the Queen\u2019s Speech in disbelief, as he was compelled to deliver a government-stamped rhetoric to the nation which failed to mention the word \u201cclimate\u201d even once. And now we hear that the government has underspent its net zero budget by a staggering quarter of a billion pounds. Just months after proudly trumpeting \u201ccash\u201d as one of his four flagship pledges day after day during Cop26, Boris Johnson has evidently filed the whole summit away in a dusty drawer, never to be seen or spoken of again. The Tories now fundamentally fail to even acknowledge, let alone address, this crisis. When we face a soaring cost of living, with bills spiralling out of control and pensioners travelling on buses all day just to keep warm \u2013 alongside an energy security crisis, while we in the UK currently have the leakiest homes in Europe \u2013 we need big, bold, positive solutions. Perhaps most frustratingly of all; those solutions are staring the prime minister in the face. We need a retrofit revolution \u2013 a mass programme of heat pumps and insulation for 10 million homes designed to slash energy bills, reduce energy demand, and cut emissions while we\u2019re at it. We need a Green New Deal to decarbonise our economy and create thousands of new, well-paid green jobs, in sectors ranging from renewable energy to care work. And we need to shift away from the dangerous pursuit of endless economic growth at all costs, towards making wellbeing our main economic goal \u2013 of people, communities and our natural world. Yes, these solutions cost money. We\u2019re not ashamed to say that the Green Party\u2019s retrofitting plan would cost \u00a325bn a year, for 10 years. But while climate sceptics like Steve Baker wax lyrical about the \u201ccost of net zero\u201d, they conveniently omit the cost of not getting to net zero. A recent report by the well-respected Institute for Government found that \u201cthe costs of failing to bring climate change under control would be much larger than those associated with decarbonisation\u201d. Perhaps the most telling example of this is David Cameron\u2019s decision to \u201ccut the green crap\u201d, which actually added \u00a3150 to every household energy bill , and cost the economy \u00a38.3bn. Ending onshore wind projects, solar subsidies and energy efficiency schemes has made people worse off, not better off.

I dare Steve Baker or any other member of \u201cNet Zero Watch\u201d to speak to Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose own daughter died from air pollution on London\u2019s South Circular \u2013 or the families of 180 people who died in floods across Germany and western Europe last summer \u2013 and tell them we can\u2019t tackle the climate crisis because it\u2019s too expensive. What this week\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech showed is that our government refuses to spend because it lacks vision, ideas, and a sense of purpose. Held hostage, perhaps willingly (as no one really knows what our prime minister believes) by fanatical low-tax, low-spend right-wing backbenchers and an arch-Thatcherite chancellor, Boris Johnson is falling woefully short when it comes to financing the solutions to the cost of living crisis, the energy security crisis and the climate crisis. \u201cWe all agree what needs to be done. We just need the courage to get on and do it.\u201d For once, I agree with these wise words from our prime minister at Cop26 last November. But six months on, and I\u2019m still waiting.

The study, by the University of Glasgow , is called Turn Up The Volume and draws on YouGov UK polling of 2,184 adults from across the UK. Results showed those who love a tune expect the music industry to do more about the climate emergency and sustainability. The survey asked a range of questions related to music, including how songs are listened to and purchased, and attitudes to environmental concerns. Music culture has a long history of playing a key role in social movements, and the evidence shows this link is still strong in the present day when it comes to the climate emergency The poll found that 82% of music fans were concerned about climate change compared with 72% of non-music fans. When broken down, these figures showed 42% of music fans were \u201cvery concerned\u201d, compared with 31% of non-music fans feeling the same. The survey also found 54% of music lovers believed \u201ctackling climate change should be a top priority now, above other issues\u201d compared with 47% of non-fans. Dr Matt Brennan, who led the study, said: \u201cThe project findings are exciting because they demonstrate a clear relation between engaged music fandom, increased concern about climate change, and desire for action. \u201cMusic culture has a long history of playing a key role in social movements, and the evidence shows this link is still strong in the present day when it comes to the climate emergency. As an industry we need to harness this passion and commitment and drive lasting and meaningful long-term change as we look to decarbonise in a sustainable way \u201cThis should send a strong message across the music industries, to record labels, concert promoters, streaming platforms, artists, and other sectors, that there is an appetite for industry initiatives to tackle climate change, and that fans support, and indeed demand, bolder action. \u201cIt represents an opportunity for the music sector to play a more prominent role in accelerating a just and green transition.\u201d The poll also found that people who value music are prepared to engage with it in a more sustainable way. One example included that people who spend money on merchandise such as records are willing to opt for more sustainable products, while live event attendees said they will look to go to more sustainable-orientated music events. MJ Olaore, of the BPI , the UK record labels association and a lead partner on the project, welcomed the findings. She said: \u201cAddressing climate change is the critical issue facing all of us and, as this timely survey shows, it\u2019s something that music fans really care about and are particularly determined to do something about. \u201cAs an industry we need to harness this passion and commitment and drive lasting and meaningful long-term change as we look to decarbonise in a sustainable way.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The Cop26 president is leading the climate meeting in Denmark with Egypt\u2019s foreign affairs minister Sameh Shoukry who will lead this year\u2019s climate talks, Cop27, in Sharm El-Sheikh. More than 40 countries will come together in Copenhagen this week to assess action that is needed to deliver on key commitments made at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow last November. It is the first of a series of meetings that it is hoped will continue to drive action to tackle dangerous global warming even as the world confronts the war in Ukraine, energy and food security and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. It comes as the Met Office warns the world has a 50-50 chance in the next five of temporarily exceeding the 1.5C global warming limit which countries pledged to meet in the Paris Agreement in 2015 and confirmed in Glasgow. Reports from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) science body have warned the window to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold beyond which the worst impacts will be felt, is rapidly closing. Ministers at the meeting will focus on how to drive down emissions in sectors such as reducing coal production and deforestation, UK officials said. They will also consider efforts to adapt to climate change and support to address loss and damage suffered communities on the front line of global warming. Russia\u2019s aggression towards Ukraine has caused prompted moves by countries that help or hinder climate action, by increasing pressure to boost production of fossil fuels elsewhere or speeding up the transition to clean tech such as renewables and electric vehicles and heat pumps. Mr Sharma said: \u201cSince the Glasgow Climate Pact was signed at Cop26, the IPCC reports on adaptation and mitigation have shown unequivocally that the window of time we have left to secure a liveable future is closing rapidly. \u201cAnd of course, the Putin regime\u2019s brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine has changed international politics fundamentally. \u201cHowever, the chronic threat of climate change remains, which is why I am pleased to co-chair this ministerial meeting on implementation bringing countries together to drive forward action on pledges already made. Mr Shoukry, minister of foreign affairs of Egypt and Cop27 President designate said: \u201cClimate action has never been more important. \u201cThe world needs to demonstrate its continued commitment to curb emissions, enhance adaptation, and deliver on climate finance. \u201cCop27 should see us all coming together to renew our determination, take stock on where we stand on implementation, and lay out a clear path towards turning pledges into tangible action on the ground.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

While a significant chunk of research on climate change assesses overall macro effects like economic and societal health outcomes from extreme weather events, scientists have now said the ongoing crisis may also have a strong influence on fundamental human activities like sleep. About 50-58 hours of sleep per person could be eroded every year by 2099 because of changing ambient temperatures and suboptimal temperatures due to the global climate crisis, said the new study published last week in the journal One Earth by scientists including those from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. They said the climate crisis could lead to a host of behavioral, psychological and physiological outcomes essential to human wellbeing. Scientists said the temperature effect on sleep loss could be substantially larger for residents from lower-income countries as well as in older adults and females. \u201cOur results indicate that sleep \u2013 an essential restorative process integral for human health and productivity \u2013 may be degraded by warmer temperatures,\u201d Kelton Minor, first author of the study and PhD candidate from the University of Copenhagen, said in a statement. \u201cIn order to make informed climate policy decisions moving forward, we need to better account for the full spectrum of plausible future climate impacts extending from today\u2019s societal greenhouse gas emissions choices,\u201d he said. While previous studies have clearly shown hot days increase deaths and hospitalisations and worsen human performance, researchers said biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying these impacts have not been well understood. Studies have also found the subjective quality of sleep to decrease during periods of hot weather. How temperature fluctuations impact changes in objective sleep outcomes in people living in a variety of global climates, however, remains unclear. \u201cIn this study, we provide the first planetary-scale evidence that warmer-than-average temperatures erode human sleep. We show that this erosion occurs primarily by delaying when people fall asleep and by advancing when they wake up during hot weather,\u201d Mr Minor said. In the research, scientists analysed anonymised global sleep data collected from accelerometer-based sleep-tracking wristbands. The analysis included 7 million nightly sleep records from more than 47,000 adults across 68 countries spanning all continents except for Antarctica, researchers said. On very warm nights \u2013 greater than 30C (86F) \u2013 scientists said sleep declines an average of just over 14 minutes, with the likelihood of getting less than seven hours of sleep increasing as temperatures rise. \u201cOur bodies are highly adapted to maintain a stable core body temperature, something that our lives depend on,\u201d Mr Minor explained. \u201cYet every night they do something remarkable without most of us consciously knowing \u2013 they shed heat from our core into the surrounding environment by dilating our blood vessels and increasing blood flow to our hands and feet,\u201d he added. For our bodies to transfer heat, researchers said the surrounding environment needs to be cooler. Previous controlled studies in sleep labs have also shown both humans and animals sleep worse when the room temperature is too hot or too cold. Under normal living routines, people appear far better at adapting to colder outside temperatures than hotter conditions. \u201cAcross seasons, demographics, and different climate contexts, warmer outside temperatures consistently erode sleep, with the amount of sleep loss progressively increasing as temperatures become hotter,\u201d Mr Minor observed. He said people in developing countries seem to be more affected by these changes. While the greater prevalence of air conditioning in developed countries could play a role, researchers could not definitively identify the reason because they did not have data on air conditioning access among subjects. The study also warned that the impact of warming temperatures on sleep loss is unequal globally. They called for further research to consider more vulnerable populations, particularly those residing in the world\u2019s hottest \u2013 and historically poorest \u2013 regions. \u201cWithout further adaptation, and should greenhouse gas concentrations not be stabilised until the end of the century, each person could be subjected to an average of 2 weeks of temperature-attributed short sleep each year,\u201d scientists concluded in the study.

The \u2018heat dome\u2019 that hit Canada in 2021 and a cold snap in France the same year has seen the condiment in short supply on the shelves of supermarkets. Luc Vandermaesen, managing director of Reine de Dijon and president of the Burgundy Mustard Association, told industry news outlet L\u2019Usine Nouvelle that the war in Ukraine has restricted seed supply because both Ukraine and Russia are major exporters. \u201cThe Ukraine, without being a big producer, represented a backup plan,\u201d he said. We were counting on it to make the connection with the next harvest , but this solution fell through.\u201d \u201cWe have no guarantee or visibility on supplies beyond the fortnight.\u201d According to newspaper Sud Ouest , seed production in Canada fell from 130,000 tonnes in 2020 to only 99,000 in 2021, a decrease of 28%, because of drought.\u00a0The price per tonne is nearly 1,700 euros (\u00a31440), double compared to the same period last year. The 2019 ban of certain pesticides are also a factor as it is difficult to stop pests from eating crops. The Association of Mustard Seed Producers in Burgundy, French mustard production is greatly slowed down by this problem. Inflation is another issue. According to French statistic organisation\u00a0 INSEE \u00a0, inflation should exceed per cent in May and reach 5. per cent in June.\u00a0The repercussions on the food sector are substantial.\u00a0Mustard is among the five consumer products whose price increased the most. The British Retail Consortium, which represents UK retailers, told The Guardian the impact on British mustard supply is \u201cvery limited at the moment\u201d.

Shoppers are increasingly aware of the climate and environmental impact of clothes. Fast fashion is a key player in the 93 billion cubic metres of water - enough to meet the needs of five million people - used by the clothing industry each year, the United Nations says. It also plays a big part in the half a million tons of microfibre, equal to three million barrels of oil, the clothing industry dumps into the ocean annually. On top of that, more than half of thrown away clothes end up in landfill . But awareness isn\u2019t slowing down the booming fast fashion empires. On its current trajectory, the fashion industry is expected to increase its emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 . While some brands have introduced sustainability initiatives and have pledged to reduce carbon emissions or increase recycled materials, Some leaders have decided this doesn\u2019t go far enough - or at worst is \u2018greenwashing\u2019 - and it\u2019s time for an intervention at scale. Join a panel of experts including Livia Firth, Founder & Creative Director of Eco Age, and more to be announced, hosted by Louise Boyle , The Independent \u2019s Senior Climate Correspondent. Audience questions will shape the discussion so make sure you submit yours for the panel to answer ahead of time or during the event. The event will take place on Zoom on Thursday 9 June at 6.30pm.

{"id":null,"body":"Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in The copper-tinged clay has the potential to transform potent methane into carbon dioxide Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile MIT scientists have discovered a low-cost product that could have signficant potential for curbing rampant global warming. A team of researchers found that when you add copper to Zeolite clay, which is used to make cat litter, and heat it up, the substance can help transform methane into carbon dioxide (CO2), The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. In a paper describing the process last year, the MIT team wrote that the idea \u201cillustrates the promise of using low-cost, earth-abundant materials to mitigate methane and slow the pace of climate change\u201d. While CO2 is the most prominent planet-warming greenhouse gas, created largely by humans burning fossil fuels, it\u2019s not the only one. Methane has around 30 times the warming effect of CO2 over 100 years. Methane is mainly produced from venting and leaks from the fossil fuel industry, landfills, and, notoriously, livestock like cattle, the EPA notes . The cattle digestive system produces methane as it breaks down food in a process called \u201centeric fermentation,\u201d which the EPA says is reponsible for 27 per cent of US methane emissions, mostly from cows . Globally, livestock emit around 155 million tonnes of methane per year, according to the UN Environment Program. Tackling the climate crisis has largely centered on CO2 because it\u2019s the most common. In the US, CO2 makes up 79 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Methane comes in second at 11 per cent but that smaller amount has a large impact. Methane emissions have resulted in about 30 per cent of all global heating to date, according to the UN Environment Program . Increasingly, countries are focused on tackling methane as an crucial part of climate action. Last year, 122 countries and the European Union signed the Global Methane Pledge which aims to reduce methane emissions 30 per cent by 2030. Turning methane into CO2 wouldn\u2019t eliminate warming potential, but it would be mean less warming at least in the short-term. The MIT team were able to show that by heating the modified \u201ccat litter\u201d to a few hundred degrees Celsius, it can break down methane into CO2, even when there was little methane in the air to begin with. This means the gas would not need to be concentrated to break it down with this process. The process is would also be more feasible than other methane-reduction techniques that need higher temperatures, expensive materials and complicated setups, a press release says. The researchers aim to engineer a system that can reproduce the process on a larger scale, as well as figure out where such a contraption would be best located. Researchers are determining if a kind of methane-reduction machine with this technology could be installed on heavy-emitting sources like certain livestock farms, the Journal reports. At scale, such technology could provide a partial solution for tackling the climate crisis - however there\u2019d still be plenty of CO2 to keep warming the planet. Other research has focused on carbon capture technology to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere but so far deployment has not been widespread or advanced enough to make a significant dent in global emissions.

Greenpeace, which has backed several legal cases in Germany aimed at holding companies and governments accountable for climate change, is supporting Mr Allhoff-Cramer in his claim. Such cases have met with mixed success: some have been dismissed, while one made it to Germany\u2019s top court, which last year ordered the government to step up its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the latest case, Mr Allhoff-Cramer is calling for VW \u2013 the world\u2019s second-biggest car manufacturer based on sales \u2013 to end production of combustion engine vehicles by 2030. Allhoff-Cramer sits in a pasture next to one of his cows in Detmold, Germany German carmakers rejected a similar demand from environmental groups last year. Volkswagen said in a statement that it aims to reduce its emissions \u201cas quickly as the business allows\u201d but has set itself a 2050 deadline to cut carbon dioxide emissions to net zero. \u201cVolkswagen stands for climate protection and rapid decarbonisation of the transport sector, but cannot meet this challenge alone,\u201d the company said, adding that the transformation also depends on government regulation, technological development and buyer behaviour. The company said lawmakers should decide on climate emergency measures. Cars ready for handing over inside one of in total two \u2018car towers\u2019 at the Volkswagen car factory in Wolfsburg, Germany \u201cDisputes in civil courts through lawsuits against individual companies singled out for this purpose, on the other hand, are not the place or the means to do justice to this responsible task,\u201d VW said. \u201cWe will defend this position and ask for the lawsuit to be dismissed.\u201d In 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency caught Volkswagen using software that let diesel cars pass emissions tests and then turned off pollution controls during normal driving. The company apologised and paid tens of billions of dollars in fines, recall costs and compensation to car owners.

So where are we now? Well, here we are \u2013 over two years into the pandemic. No one wants to be the bearer of more bad news, but while we were at home, the climate emergency did not stop. In fact, we now know that the fall in carbon emissions is likely to have had very little effect on overall climate goals. Instead, during the \u201cGreat Pause\u201d, we witnessed the second hottest year on record , apocalyptic wildfires spread throughout Australia and California, hurricanes hit Central America and the Gulf Coast, and the volume of Arctic sea ice reached a record low. Biodiversity is still in freefall, deforestation is on the rise, and we aren\u2019t anywhere near close enough to meeting the modest carbon targets of the Paris Agreement . But enough is enough. Progress doesn\u2019t come from focusing on the problems \u2013 it comes from awareness that leads to solutions. And recently, we\u2019ve had plenty of those too. From innovation in renewable energy , to promises to ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 , to a surge of spending to protect natural ecosystems \u2013 could it be that we\u2019re making tracks to turn this around? Read more: The only way to know is to arm yourself and self-educate. Because with pressure comes greenwashing , and this year you\u2019re going to be hearing from plenty of companies and politicians who claim to have ecological wellbeing at heart. We\u2019ve rounded up our eight favourite books to help widen your perspective and deepen your knowledge of where we are now, and where we need to go to fix the climate crisis. Robyn Wall Kimmerer\u2019s 2013 bestseller has gained a lot of popularity in recent years thanks to heartfelt reviews from across the world. Sharing her evocative perspective, as a botanist and a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Wall Kimmener is informed by both western science and the teachings of her indigenous ancestors. This makes for some deliciously entrapping descriptions that reframe our relationship with life on this planet and explain how western perspectives that have dominated decades of \u201cdevelopment\u201d are missing out on something fundamental. Discover what everyone is talking about and get lost inside a delectable world that will encourage compassion and curiosity for everything that nature provides. You may have heard of Shock Doctrine and No Logo , but it\u2019s in This Changes Everything that Naomi Klein really gets to the crux of the defining issue of our time. Sharing how we don\u2019t have a carbon problem, but a capitalism problem, Klein exposes the myths in the climate debate, and explains how we already know how to do things like get away from fossil fuels \u2013 the problem is that it disturbs our thirst for endless economic growth. If you\u2019re craving a deeper fix and an explanation of what real systems change could look like, this is it. This Changes Everything takes you all the way through the problem to land on real-life examples of how humanity is rising to the challenge \u2013 all across the world. The original eco-bible, Small is Beautiful paved the way for today\u2019s books on environmentalism and micro-economics. Schumacher\u2019s detailed collection of essays was published in 1973, right when the energy crisis hit, and has become ever-more relevant since. His straightforward message is that we must stop mindless consumption and \u201cgigantism\u201d, and build our economic systems around communities, not corporations.\u00a0 This book is the perfect introduction to environmental politics and economics for someone who has never read anything of the sort. Small is Beautiful will open your eyes to why mass-everything was never a good idea and why, decade after decade, our inclination for small, people-centred systems is something we have to start listening to if we want to survive. McKibben\u2019s classic work on the environmental crisis makes a passionate plea for a fundamental philosophical shift in the way we relate to nature. He outlines how we need to stop seeing nature as this romantic force, independent of humans. Once it was, but now our imprint on the natural world is so strong that our need to take action is fundamental for survival. If you still need to convince a friend or relative that climate change is real, I would start here. Detailed science through a powerful soulful lens, The End of Nature is our manual for change. This 2020 collection of essays came at just the right point. Bringing together a diverse collection of women\u2019s voices \u2013 scientists, journalists, farmers, lawyers, teachers \u2013 the book highlights how women are leading the fight against the climate crisis, but still not enough of us are in leadership. The book manages to address serious topics with the love and compassion that we so desperately need and actually leaves the reader feeling hopeful, which seems like a rarity these days. Read this book and you\u2019ll gain a spectrum of ideas and insights on how we can radically reshape society and move forward on a path towards all that we can save. In the face of climate doom and fear-spreading, Drawdown is the manual to read and reread to arm yourself with tangible data. The book is the culmination of a project led by activist and entrepreneur Paul Hawken, which started in 2013 and has since brought together more than 65 researchers from across the globe with 128 experts in climate, sustainability, academia, and business.\u00a0 From commonly known solutions such as using solar energy in cities, to those more nuanced and with a social basis, this book lays out 100 solutions to help us reach \u201cdrawdown\u201d \u2013 the point in time when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere peak and begin to decline. This run-through will make you feel super-smart and empowered, and provides plenty of material to share in those difficult conversations with sceptics and apathists. Feel like you need to go to the depths of what is happening and what is to come? Look no further. The Uninhabitable Earth reads as a travelogue of the near future, explaining how the lives of billions of humans are changing and will continue to change \u2013 drastically. It shows head-on how our anxieties about things like rising sea levels barely scratch the surface. This frank and unapologetic wake-up call skips the scientific jargon and delivers the facts in urgent, elegant prose that explains how what\u2019s coming will cause an all-encompassing shift in politics, culture, sense of history \u2013 everything. With the first line, \u201c It is, worse, much worse, than you think,\u201d this book is not exactly easy reading. However, what it is good for is shaking us out of complacency to understand the effect that our lifestyle is having \u2013 now. Another person-centred account of microeconomics to add to the list, Doughnut Economics is the heralded work of Oxford academic Kate Raworth. It explains how conventional economics has left us with a system that leaves billions stuck in poverty at one end, and endless environmental destruction at the other. Instead, Raworth\u2019s proposed \u201cdoughnut\u201d represents the sweetest system, where it\u2019s possible to meet all of our needs without exhausting the planet. She explains that while we need practical and political reform, we also need a new economic system to make sure that things doesn\u2019t happen again. Read on for an accessible, relatable account that relays academic thinking back to everyday lives and communities. While we should cover all bases and get a holistic understanding of the science, economics and social change needed to avoid climate catastrophe\u2013 if we don\u2019t reframe the relationship we have with the natural world \u2013 will we ever really fix this? Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer is our number one choice for bringing the reader back to the root cause of climate change \u2013 the notion that humans and nature are two seperate things. Go ahead and pore through the pages, see if it doesn\u2019t make you crave a sustainable future where biodiversity begins to rise, everyone has access to clean water, and we grow food in a way that repairs ecosystems and strengthens communities.

In parts of northwest India and Pakistan, temperatures recently reached a record-breaking 51C during heatwaves made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis. As a result, hospital admissions for heat-related incidents have increased by a staggering 20 per cent. In parts of Bangladesh , human-induced climate change is driving floods that have led to major food shortages. Many communities have been completely submerged, leaving many dead and more than two million stranded. The United Nations says that more than 1.5 million children in the country are at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition due to the floods. In Australia, bushfires in 2020 killed or displaced nearly three billion animals. Over the past three years, the country has also been gripped by drought, cyclones and freak tides, which in turn has led to climate change becoming a key concern for citizens . These are just a few examples of a worrying trend. Over the last 20 years, natural disasters linked to the climate crisis have increased by 40 per cent. Sudden onset, climate-related disasters, such as droughts and floods, have killed around 410,000 people in the last decade, and nine in 10 of the people who lost their lives due to such hazards were in the developing world. As research from the Stockholm Environment Institute neatly summed up ahead of Stockholm+50 , which marks 50 years since the first global conference on the environment took place in the Swedish capital, the world is at boiling point. And with global greenhouse emissions continuing to rise and reach record-breaking levels in the atmosphere, the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters will only worsen. Thankfully, there is much that we can do to build resilience among vulnerable communities on the front line of the climate crisis, and a new report from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) spells out how, highlighting the often overlooked, yet transformational power of nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions involve protecting, sustainably managing and restoring ecosystems to address societal challenges such as climate change, while also boosting human wellbeing and biodiversity. The report predicts that these solutions could reduce the intensity of climate and weather-related hazards by an astonishing 26 per cent, in a world where more than three billion people live in places that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Our research shows how nature-based solutions can save lives, by reducing the likelihood of climate and weather-related disasters occurring. Where communities are exposed to the hazards of the climate crisis, for example, such solutions include healthy connected floodplains, which can reduce flood risk; reforestation, which can help prevent landslides; or restoration of mangroves and coral reefs, which can protect against storm surges. Nature-based solutions can also capture and store carbon, and provide food, livelihoods and crucial habitats. They can improve communities\u2019 water security and contribute to better human health. Promisingly, the analysis shows that nature-based solutions can also provide developing countries with massive economic savings \u2013 at least $104bn (approximately \u00a383bn) in 2030, and $393bn (\u00a3314bn) in 2050. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here There are countless examples of countries that have already seen the benefits of nature-based solutions. One is Jamaica, where coral reefs are an important natural defence for the country\u2019s coastline, protecting coastal communities and tourist hotels from the destructive force of tropical storms. Coral reefs can reduce wave energy by an estimated 75 per cent , reducing the risk of coastal erosion and flooding during storms. Fringing, patch and barrier reefs, meanwhile, protect around 60 per cent of Jamaica\u2019s shoreline. Of course, any disaster-risk reduction or adaptation measure will be obsolete unless the current levels of greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly and drastically reduced. Continued warming will simply overwhelm vulnerable communities, stymying their ability to reduce disaster risk and adapt, and reducing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions. The evidence of the interdependence between climate change and nature loss is overwhelming and we have a rapidly closing window in which we must act. All of us \u2013 governments, businesses, investors and consumers \u2013 must act together for a carbon-neutral and nature-positive future.

Addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s key security meeting, Inia Seruiratu, Fiji\u2018s minister for defence, said: \u201cIn our blue Pacific continent, machine guns, fighter jets, grey ships and green battalions are not our primary security concern. \u201cThe single greatest threat to our very existence is climate change. It threatens our very hopes and dreams of prosperity.\u201d Seruiratu\u2019s comments marked a shift in tone at the defence summit, which has so far been dominated by the war in Ukraine and disputes between China and the United States. The flow-lying Pacific island of Fiji, which also includes Tonga and Samoa, are some of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the extreme weather events caused by climate change. And the island has been battered repeatedly by tropical cyclones in recent years, causing devastating flooding that has displaced thousands from their homes. \u201cWaves are crashing at our doorsteps, winds are battering our homes, we are being assaulted by this enemy from many angles,\u201d Seruiratu told delegates. Talks have thus far been dominated by debate over Russia\u2019s military operations in Ukraine, and the US and China exchanging barbs over everything from Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty to naval bases in the Pacific. To the alarm of the US, Australia and New Zealand, China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands in April, stirring up fears pf a stepped-up military presence by Beijing in the Pacific. But Beijing has said that it is not establishing a military base in the Solomon Islands and that its goal is to strengthen security cooperation with Pacific island nations. China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi conducted a tour of the Pacific islands last month in the hope of securing a sweeping regional trade and security pact, but the island nations were unable to reach a consensus on a deal. Seruiratu played down concerns about a battle for influence in the Pacific islands while highlighting his country\u2019s willingness to work with a range of countries. \u201cIn Fiji, we are not threatened by geopolitical competition,\u201d Seruiratu said, adding: \u201cWe have to adapt how we work and who we work with to achieve stability.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

In an exclusive interview with The Independent , Sadyr Zhaparov, who has been president of the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan since being voted into power in January last year, said that the devastating impact of climate change on nations in mountainous countries is too often overlocked. \u201cThe world is facing global climate change, which is fraught with dangerous consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially true for us mountain countries because these problems are more dynamic and specific: glaciers melting and natural water reserves decreasing, which can lead to imminent disaster. \u201cThat is why the international community should pay special attention to the needs of the developing mountainous countries that have been badly hit by climate change and note the importance of the \u201cclimate justice\u201d concept while taking actions in order to address climate change. \u201cKyrgyzstan is home for almost ten thousand glaciers. Over the last twenty years, we are witnessing an irreversible melting of those century old glaciers that is leading to gradual shrinking of water resources.\u201d Mr Zhaparov has become a leading figure in the global warming debate since he gave an emotion speech at COP26 in Glasgow. In it, he called on the world to recognise it was not just low-lying countries that faced the greatest danger from climate change but also those at far higher altitudes, like Kyrgyzstan, where the impact too often goes unrecognised. Since then he has become a global figurehead for such states demanding a reduction in carbon emissions, most recently through presenting at the United Nations last month a five-year plan for mountain countries to work together to try to protect their unique ecosystems. Talking in his presidential office in the country\u2019s capital Bishkek, Mr Zhaparov explained that his determination to raise awareness about the issue is particularly acute as he had grown up in a mountainous region of the country and has witnessed for himself how the environment there is changing. \u201cI am a frequent visitor to the village where I was born,\u201d he said, \u201cand I can see that the glaciers are disappearing in the blink of an eye. The reason I raised this issues at Glasgow and since is that I am a witness to the effects of climate change in our own mountains. \u201cPeople do not talk about it as they do the impact of climate change on other states as they are not aware of a country like Kyrgyzstan and the problems here. If it was a big country like the UK or USA and they had these problems then it would be different. The international community does not notice us and they should.\u201d The land-locked nation of Kyrgyzstan borders China and became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Settled by Kyrgyz tribes from Siberia and Altay before and during the time of Genghis Khan, the area, the area was ruled by various regional powers before coming under Russian and then Soviet rule. It is home to 158 mountain ranges and most of its six million people are Turkic-speaking Muslims. Mr Zhaparov won a landslide victory in the 2021 presidential election and acquired sweeping new powers after voters amended the constitution in a referendum. He spent seven years in exile during the rule of President Almazbek Atambayev and his successor Sooronbay Jeenbekov, and has pledged to make tackling corruption his main domestic priority in office. The United Nations has warned that mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to the impacts of climate change and are being affected at a faster rate than other terrestrial habitats. Forty percent of the world\u2019s population rely indirectly on mountain resources for drinking water, agriculture, biodiversity, and hydroelectricity, which could be lost as a result of global warming. Climate change is also likely to increase exposure to hazards, with extreme events such as avalanches and landslides becoming more common. Mountains are also home to a high degree of biodiversity, including many endemic species, and in Kyrgyzstan the landscape is particularly important as home to the rare snow leopard. Mr Zhaparov said the country was taking its own steps to tackle carbon emissions. Since his election a new initiative called Green Heritage aims for six million new trees to be planted in the country each year, and it is gradually transitioning from carbon-producing energy to renewable sources of power, particularly hydroelectric. \u201cWe are doing our best to counter the adverse effects of climate change that are in our control,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed the Decree \u2018On Declaring 2022 the Year of Protection of Mountain Ecosystems and Climate Sustainability\u2019 in order to address environmental and climate change adaptation challenges and help preserve those glaciers and rivers from drying up. \u201cGiven the growing scarcity of water resources, we are working to introduce water-sparing technologies in agriculture and other sectors of the national economy. We are also expanding public access to the clean potable water and increase efficiency of its daily use by offering financial incentives and raising awareness.\u201d But Mr Zhaparov warned it would not be enough unless there was recognition and support from the international community of the particular challenges global warming caused to countries like his. \u201cKyrgyzstan will welcome any unconditional assistance of the international community that will underpin our efforts to mitigate and adapt to the climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a child I used to travel in the mountains with my father. He was a forester and his job was to cut back the long glass. I used to go with him and I remember when I was a boy he suddenly told me to stop and look. He had binoculars. I looked through them and there, crawling on the mountain, for the first time I saw a snow leopard. \u201cHere in Kyrgyzstan we are doing all we can to protect snow leopards like that one but, unless the international community acts, then I am afraid that my grandchildren will never experience the same sights I did as a child with my father.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The climate crisis and deforestation are causing devastating loses for habitats around the world \u2013 and the consequences could soon hit some of the UK\u2019s favourite foods. That\u2019s according to Rainforest Alliance, which says the impact of deforestation, the biodiversity crisis and warming temperatures is making it more challenging for farmers. Protecting themselves from extreme weather is now more difficult, a s is reaping successful harvests and even growing certain crops, Rainforest Alliance says. The not-for-profit organisation, which helps protect forests and helps farmers mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, says these challenges will affect staples such as wheat, corn and rice, but also key raw ingredients for some of Britain\u2019s favourite foods. Here are five that are threatened: Chocolate The key ingredient in chocolate is the cocoa bean. Climate change and unsustainable farming methods are already leading to a crisis in cocoa production, with some areas that once produced bountiful harvests now unsuitable for growing, according to the Rainforest Alliance. Less rainfall, soil depletion and more pests and diseases are reducing crop yields and reducing the quality of the crop, the group said. Higher temperatures also means less humidity, leaving the cocoa tree too dry to survive and meaning cultivation must move to higher land, sometimes spreading into forested areas which are then cut down. This deforestation then exacerbates the climate crisis in a vicious cycle. As the area suitable for cocoa cultivation shrinks, it\u2019s possible global demand for chocolate will no longer be able to be met, the group said. Tea Tea plants grow best in tropical and subtropical climates that have hot humid summers and cool dry winters, according to the Rainforest Alliance. However, the rainy and dry seasons are increasingly out of sync due to climate change , causing some tea plantations to \u201cdrown\u201d while others die of thirst, the group said. The unpredictability of cultivating tea means its becoming increasingly economically unviable for farmers, it added. Avocados Avocados need a lot of water to grow but are mainly cultivated in regions that suffer from heatwaves and droughts thanks to climate change, the Rainforest Alliance says. In regions where water supplies are already low this is making cultivation more challenging, it said. Like elsewhere, to meet the demand forests are being chopped down in order to plant avocado trees. Bananas For bananas, higher temperatures brings more pests and diseases, and the climate can even become too hot and dry for the fruit that likes high tempeartures, the Rainforest Alliance said. Coffee Higher temperatures are also spreading diseases that affect coffee plantations, such as \u201ccoffee rust\u201d, a fungal disease, the group said. Higher altitude land is also in demand for coffee plants as temperatures gets hotter leading to further deforestation, it added.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Every heatwave being experienced today has been made more intense and more likely to happen because of climate change, scientists have warned. A review of extreme weather hazards shows that for some, such as heatwaves, it is \u201cunequivocal\u201d they are worsening because of global warming, and the impact in terms of lives lost and financial costs are being underestimated. For others, such as tropical cyclones, there are variations between regions and the role that climate change plays in each event. But severe droughts in many parts of the world are not due to climate change, the review by scientists from University of Oxford , Imperial College London and the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand , said. Extreme weather events linked to climate change have caused a large number of deaths and cost billions of pounds in damage in recent decades, the study published in the journal Environmental Research: Climate said. The review looked at information from the latest reports from the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and results from the growing body of attribution studies which use weather observations and climate models to identify the role of global warming in specific events. There's no doubt climate change is really an absolute gamechanger when it comes to heatwaves It focused on changes to five hazards \u2013 heatwaves, rainfall-based flooding, tropical cyclones, wildfires and droughts \u2013 and the impacts of recent specific events, in what the researchers said was the starting point for an inventory on the effects and costs of climate change. Study co-author Dr Friederike Otto from Imperial College London said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the case that climate change was already making heatwaves more likely and intense. \u201cWe can very confidently say that every heatwave that is occurring today is made more intense and more likely because of climate change. \u201cThere are local factors like land use changes that might change how much more likely, but there\u2019s no doubt climate change is really an absolute gamechanger when it comes to heatwaves\u201d, around the world, she said. It was no longer necessary to wait for the attribution studies \u2013 which she helped pioneer \u2013 on individual heatwaves to know that they were being driven by climate change, she said. In the UK people thought of building flood defences to adapt to global warming, but the big change for Britain when it came to climate change was\u00a0 in heatwaves \u2013 and extreme heat was deadly, she said. But in other extremes, such as drought, the role of climate change was being overestimated. Dr Otto pointed to East Africa , which has a naturally highly variable climate that contributes to drought, and warned that disaster there was linked to poverty and lack of health care systems and infrastructure. The study authors say there is a need to record the impact of extreme weather far more systematically around the world, as a lack of data on previous events makes it harder to cope with future extremes. Understanding the role that climate change plays in these events can help us better prepare for them Work to attribute weather extremes to climate change needs to be improved in lower and middle income countries, where there are big gaps and where the impact of rising global temperatures will be greatest, the paper says. Lead author Ben Clarke, from the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe rise of more extreme and intense weather events such as heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall have dramatically increased in recent years, affecting people all over the globe. \u201cUnderstanding the role that climate change plays in these events can help us better prepare for them. It also allows us to determine the real cost that carbon emissions have in our lives.\u201d On the different types of extremes, the review found that: \u2013 Heatwaves are now occurring far more frequently and are hotter, and some events are happening that would be all but impossible without climate change, with tens of thousands of heat-related deaths a year due to global warming. \u2013 Heavy rain events have become more frequent and intense across most parts of the world, mainly due to climate change, with a growing number of floods made more intense by the effects of rising temperatures on rainfall. \u2013 Tropical cyclones have seen no significant changes in frequency globally, but a greater fraction of those that do happen are the most intense category four and five \u201csuperstorms\u201d, and events such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have been amplified by climate change. \u2013 Wildfire risk has already substantially increased in many regions and recent blazes in Canada, the US, Australia and other parts of the world have been made much more likely by climate change, causing deaths, the health impact of air pollution, billions of pounds of damage and harm to wildlife. \u2013 Drought is worsening due to climate change in some already at-risk places such as the Mediterranean and western US, but severe droughts in many parts of the world are not attributable to climate change, due to high natural variability.

{"id":null,"body":" Accurate beliefs can be rapidly eroded by exposure to climate-sceptic messages, US scientists warn Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Exposure to climate scepticism can change people\u2019s beliefs on the subject, a new US study suggests Scientific reporting on the world\u2019s worsening climate crisis can help people adopt more accurate beliefs on the issue \u2013 but they are quickly eroded by climate-sceptic messages, a study has found. These are the findings of a team of researchers at Ohio State University who conducted an online study of 2,898 people who each took part in four waves of the research during autumn 2020. Thomas Wood, associate professor of political science at The Ohio State University said: \u201cIt is not the case that the American public does not respond to scientifically informed reporting when they are exposed to it. \u201cBut even factually accurate science reporting recedes from people\u2019s frame of reference very quickly.\u201d The research team said they found that these accurate beliefs faded quickly and can erode when people are exposed to coverage which minimises the threat of the climate crisis. They found the same effect across both Democrat and Republican voters. Across the political divide people who initially rejected human-caused climate change also had their opinions shifted by reading accurate articles. In the first wave of the study, all participants read media articles that provided information reflecting the scientific consensus on the climate crisis. Then in the second and third waves of the experiment, they read either another scientific article, an opinion article that was sceptical of climate science, an article that discussed the partisan debate over climate change, or an article on an unrelated subject. And in the fourth wave, participants simply were asked their beliefs about the science of climate change and their policy attitudes. To rate participants\u2019 scientific understanding, the research team asked after each wave if they believed that climate change is happening and has a human cause. To measure participants\u2019 attitudes, the researchers asked if they favoured government action on climate change and if they favoured renewable energy. Dr Wood said it was significant that accurate reporting had positive effects on all groups, including Republicans and those who originally rejected the science of climate change. But he said it was even more encouraging that it affected attitudes. \u201cNot only did science reporting change people\u2019s factual understanding, it also moved their political preferences,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made them think that climate change was a pressing government concern that government should do more about.\u201d But the positive effects on people\u2019s beliefs were short-lived, the results showed. These effects largely disappeared in later waves of the study. In addition, opinion stories that were sceptical of the scientific consensus on the climate crisis reversed the accuracy gains generated by reading science coverage. Articles featuring partisan conflict had no measurable effects on people\u2019s beliefs and attitudes. Overall, the results suggest that the media plays a key role in Americans\u2019 beliefs and attitudes about scientific issues such as climate change. \u201cIt was striking to us how amenable the subjects in our study were to what they read about climate change in our study. But what they learned faded very quickly,\u201d Dr Wood said. But the team noted that their results conflict with the media imperative to only report on what is new. \u201cWhat we found suggests that people need to hear the same accurate messages about climate change again and again. If they only hear it once, it recedes very quickly,\u201d Dr Wood said. \u201cThe news media isn\u2019t designed to act that way.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Climate change is pushing up sweltering summer temperatures, experts said as they warned that the UK needs to urgently adapt to a future with more heatwaves. Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London , said the soaring temperatures facing the UK would not have been as high without global warming. \u201cEvery heatwave we are experiencing now has been made more frequent, longer and hotter because of climate change,\u201d she told the PA news agency. \u201cOf course, every extreme weather event has also an element of just the chaotic natural variability of the weather system. Heatwaves are extremely deadly, much more so than floods or storms \u201cThere would have been high temperatures without climate change, but they would not have been as high as what we will see \u2013 no matter what exactly we will see, we know for sure it would have been cooler without climate change.\u201d Dr Otto, one of the scientists behind pioneering studies that attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events, warned that heatwaves kill. And she said very hot spells have a greater potential impact than other climate extremes such as flooding in the UK, as their frequency is increasing at a faster rate, and, while floods have a high cost impact on infrastructure, more people die in heatwaves. \u201c Heat kills. Heatwaves are extremely deadly, much more so than floods or storms,\u201d she said, warning that people tend to die in their homes, with extreme heat affecting those with existing medical problems and linked to inequality. But she said the \u201cgood news\u201d is that efforts to tackle climate change, such as insulating homes, and redesigning cities to make more room for green space, could also help the UK adapt to more heatwaves. We urgently need to improve our existing housing stock to better insulate against both hot and cold weather Heatwaves are made more intense and frequent mainly because overall temperatures are higher due to global warming, and so, when weather systems such as summer high pressure occur, the heat they bring is amplified. Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading , said: \u201cHeatwaves are caused by weather patterns that produce persistent high-pressure, cloud-free conditions and dry continental winds during summer. \u201cClimate change is intensifying these heatwaves as greenhouse gas increases raise temperatures and a warmer, more thirsty atmosphere dries out the soil so that more of the sun\u2019s energy is available to heat the ground rather than evaporating water.\u201d Professor Nigel Arnell, from the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said the current heatwave is not the first of the year, and probably will not be the last. We urgently need to improve our existing housing stock to better insulate against both hot and cold weather \u2013 and that will help reduce our exposure to rising energy bills too \u201cAnd we\u2019ll get more next year, and the year after, and so on. Our analysis shows that we are highly likely to get more and longer heatwaves in the future due to climate change, for the numbers of heat-health alerts, heat-stress days \u2013 days when it is too hot to work \u2013 and damaging heat extremes to increase.\u201d He warned that the UK is \u201cnot really geared up to deal with more frequent heatwaves\u201d, apart from enacting emergency plans, and the country cannot run in crisis mode each summer. \u201cWe urgently need to improve our existing housing stock to better insulate against both hot and cold weather \u2013 and that will help reduce our exposure to rising energy bills too,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":" Some 90 per cent of heat is being absorbed by the ocean Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile As summer kicks into high gear, heatwaves have already gripped parts of the United States, Europe and South Asia with recording-breaking temperatures and deadly conditions. In the past 100 years, heatwaves have become hotter and more frequent across the world, according to the latest report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global authority on climate science. The average global temperature has risen roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution began in the 19th century. The IPCC is unequivocal about what\u2019s causing this additional heat in the atmosphere: emissions created largely from humanity\u2019s burning of fossil fuels. Some 90 per cent of that heat is being absorbed by the ocean, the consequences of which are already dire. Warmer waters can lead to coral reef bleaching, where the corals lose the algae that populate them and the reefs turn white and devoid of much life. And higher temperatures can decrease oxygen levels in the water \u2013 oxygen that marine life needs to live, putting stress on some ocean ecosystems. Warmer water also expands, contributing to global sea level rise, in addition to water that comes from glacial melt in rapidly-heating polar regions. Marine heat can be devasting for wildlife. During the 2021 Pacific Northwest (PNW) heatwave, the deaths of millions of marine animals were linked to the extreme temperatures The damage extends far beyond sea-level rise and marine life. In 2021, that heatwave in PNW and western Canada killed hundreds of people, saw roads buckle and wildfires erupt. This spring, a heatwave in India and Pakistan killed 90 people , devastated crops and led to power shortages . Even polar regions, more commonly associated with snow and ice, have been hit with heatwaves that send temperatures far above normal, leading to further melting ice and permafrost. The Pacific Northwest and South Asian heatwaves were found to have been hotter, and more likely, because of human-caused climate change, according to the World Weather Attribution network, an international group of climate scientists who are now able to swiftly diagnose such events. The US heatwave in 2021 was found to be \u201c virtually impossible \u201d without the climate crisis \u2014 and in South Asia this year, the deadly heat was made 30 times more likely by humanity\u2019s actions. The IPCC also found that some extreme heat experienced worldwide over the past ten years would have been \u201cextremely unlikely to occur without human influence\u201d. Some impacts of heat are plainly visible, like ice melting and wildfires erupting. But heatwaves also stress water, energy and transportation infrastructure, as well as food systems and livelihoods from crop and cattle losses, says the World Health Organization . And heat is a silent killer. Between 1992 and 2021, heat was the deadliest type of disaster in the US with an average 158 people dying, in comparison to 88 in floods, 71 in tornadoes and 45 from hurricanes. Individual heatwaves can be extremely deadly too. The 2003 European heatwave killed over 70,000 people,  and the 2010 Russian heatwave resulted in over 50,000 dead. A recent study looking at mortality in hundreds of locations in 43 different countries found that about 37 per cent of heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2018 were attributable to the climate crisis. Extreme heat is especially dangerous for vulnerable groups like the elderly, young children and people with medical conditions. Worryingly, the climate crisis is increasing night-time temperatures, eliminating the ability for people and buildings to cool down, according to the US Center for Disease Control . Global heating is also causing potentially deadly spikes in humidity. When combined with extreme heat, high humidity can make it much more difficult for people to cool themselves by sweating. The so-called \u201cwet-bulb\u201d temperature combines temperature and humidity to measure the potential for heat stress. Any wet bulb temperature above 95F (35C) is considered unsurvivable for someone in the sun for more than six hours. Most of the time, wet-bulb temperature is below the actual temperature \u2014 an 80F (27C) day with 50 per cent relative humidity has a wet-bulb temperature around 67F (19C), for example. But a 100F (38C) day with 85 per cent humidity would have a wet-bulb temperature over 95F (35C). A recent study found that these instances, while still somewhat rare, have doubled in frequency since 1979. Cities are hit especially hard by heatwaves \u2014 a rising problem, considering that two-thirds of all people will live in urban areas by 2050. In the US, cities are around 1-7F (0.5-4C) hotter than surrounding areas during the day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This \u201curban heat island effect\u201d stems from manmade materials like asphalt and concrete that absorb and retain more heat than natural landscapes like forests and fields. Heatwaves can cause positive feedback loops that fuel even more heat. As temperatures rise, more water evaporates into the atmosphere. And more water vapor in the atmosphere means more warming \u2014in turn, leading to more evaporation and more warming. When excessive heat melts permafrost in polar regions, it can lead to the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane. In everyday life, more heat means more people cranking up air conditioning units, leading to more power usage derived from burning fossil fuels \u2013 and even more potential feedback loops. Under current emissions cuts pledged by nations, the world is tracking for an average temperature rise of 2.7C by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker , an independent scientific analysis tool. At 2C, heatwaves that once occurred every decade would happen about every two years and be 2.6C hotter, the IPCC says. Far more rare, intense heatwaves that happened every 50 years would happen about 14 times as often and be 2.7C hotter. If the world were to reach 4C of warming \u2014 which is possible if emissions continue to rise through the rest of the century \u2014 both the 10-year and 50-year heatwaves would occur a little less than once per year, the IPCC said. And the climate crisis isn\u2019t just causing extreme heat events \u2014 it may also be making the average day just a little bit hotter. The Climate Shift Index , a tool created by the non-profit Climate Central, shows how more or less frequent each day\u2019s high and low temperature is in the lower 48 US states has become due to global heating. The map shows how even mildly hotter days may have become more likely as the planet has heated.

{"id":null,"body":"The UK is in the grip of an \u201cexceptional\u201d heatwave with temperatures looking likely to smash current records \u2013 set just a few years ago. Here are answers to some of the key questions about the role of climate change in heatwaves. \u2013 Is climate change already affecting heatwaves? Yes. Dr Friederike Otto, one of the scientists who have pioneered studies that spell out the role of global warming in extreme weather events, has said every heatwave today is made more likely, frequent and intense by climate change. A World Weather Attribution study into the heatwave in central and western Europe in summer 2019 that set a new record for the UK of 38.7C in Cambridge found it would have been up to 3C cooler if the climate was not changing. The same group of international scientists, who compare what would have happened without climate change and with the current level of warming, also found that last year\u2019s record-shattering heatwave in the US and Canada would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without rising global temperatures. \u2013 How does climate change affect heatwaves? Average global temperatures have risen by as much as 1.2C since the industrial revolution as a result of human activities that put heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as burning fossil fuels. So when naturally occurring hot periods happen, they come on top of this warming, pushing temperatures even higher than they would have been, making heatwaves more frequent and intense. In addition, climate change can lead to drier soil conditions in some areas which means the sun\u2019s energy heats the ground and air, rather than being used to evaporate water, adding to the heat. And some parts of the world, such as Africa, are heating up faster than the global average, so when we get warm air flowing from the south, that also makes the heat more extreme. \u2013 What are the consequences of more heatwaves? Extreme heat is deadly, and heatwaves can kill thousands of people, with around 3,000 people dying in the UK in 2021 due to hot conditions, according to Dr Vikki Thompson, climate scientist at the University of Bristol. While extreme cold is still the biggest weather killer of people in the UK, Prof Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading warns heatwaves will begin to take over as the most dangerous natural hazard in years to come without action to curb climate change. More heatwaves will also mean more disruption to travel, health services and work and education, and the hot conditions \u2013 especially coming after dry periods such as the one seen in parts of England this year \u2013 make wildfires more likely. \u2013 Isn\u2019t this just like the summer of 1976 again? No. Nigel Arnell, professor of climate system science at the University of Reading, says it was hot in 1976, but not as \u201cextremely hot\u201d as it is currently. He said the impacts of that hot summer have been forgotten, and added: \u201cIt was disruptive. And it wasn\u2019t really as extreme in temperature as what we\u2019re experiencing at the moment.\u201d Dr Otto, from Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London, acknowledges that there have been heatwaves in the past, but says the difference in 1976 was how the rest of the world looked. \u201cIn 1976, there was a heatwave in the UK. In 2022, there are heatwaves everywhere in the world. And so have been in 2021 and 2020 and 2019,\u201d she said. \u2013 What about the future? Prof Arnell says that all evidence from climate models and projections suggests heatwaves are going to get worse and more frequent. The extent of the extremes depends on what action we take to curb greenhouse gas emissions. A Met Office study found that the current chance of seeing days above 40C in the UK \u2013 which could happen on Tuesday \u2013 has increased due to climate change but is still very low. But without action to curb emissions we could be seeing those kind of temperatures every three to four years in the UK by the end of the century. If the world takes action on emissions in line with commitments in the international Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of extreme heat would be much lower. For the UK, that means delivering on its legal target to cut emissions to zero overall \u2013 known as net zero \u2013 by 2050. There is also a need to adapt the country to the already inevitable increase in heatwaves, through making sure new houses and buildings are built with sufficient ventilation and shading, and retrofitting existing properties. Cities also need more green space, and trees which can shade streets and buildings and keep them cooler.

{"id":null,"body":" Just 4 per cent of Tories put issue in their top three priorities for the next party leader Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Net zero is not a high priority Taking action on the climate emergency is the bottom priority for Conservative members in the party's leadership contest, a poll has found. Just 4 per cent of those surveyed by pollster YouGov said hitting the UK's net zero emissions target by 2050 was one of their top three priorities for the next prime minister. The survey, commissioned by the Times found that winning a general election, cutting taxes, increasing defend spending and strengthening the UK's global standing were all more important to members. Out of the 10 policy areas listed, reaching net zero was placed bottom. The news comes as an \"unprecedented\" heatwave triggers red warnings and advance to remain inside across southern Britain, with temperatures expected to reach 40 degrees celsius. While the YouGov survey suggests apathy to the climate emergency among the governing party faithful, previous research has suggested that this does not necessarily translate into antipathy. The Independent last week reported a poll of members conducted by Opinium that only a small minority, 37 per cent, of Tory members think the UK government is \"overreacting\" with its climate policies. 22 per cent of Tory members believed the government had been underreacting while 30 per cent say it is getting the balance of action about right - an apparently endorsement of net zero. That finding came despite a push from figures on the British right like ex Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and Tory backbencher Steve Baker to campaign against the policy.

All rights reserved Out of all the Tory leadership candidates only Rishi Sunak has been vocal in his support of the net zero target without reservation, and right-winger Kemi Badenoch has described it as \"unilateral economic disarmament\". She and other conservatives argue that the UK can gain an advantage by not pulling its weight on climate targets. Under net zero, the UK would have to produce no more carbon than it absorbs by 2050. There is a scientific consensus that this approach is required to avert catastrophic climate disaster, though some significant effects will still be felt. Polling by Ipsos MORI conducted in October found widespread public support for both net zero in principle and for policies such as frequent flier levies and phasing out gas boilers. Half (54 per cent) of UK voters think that the country should be reducing its carbon emissions to net zero sooner than 2050, with 83 per cent extremely, very or fairly worried about climate change.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile The record temperatures predicted next week are a \u201cwake-up call\u201d over climate change, an expert has said. On Friday, the Met Office issued its first red warning for extreme heat, predicting a 50% chance of temperatures reaching 40C somewhere in the UK early next week. Professor Hannah Cloke, climate expert and natural hazards lecturer at the University of Reading , said: \u201cI think these types of temperatures will be seen more often which is very worrying because many people will die. \u201cThis is a wake-up call for climate change. \u201cWe are going to see these worsening hot summers but we can stop it getting really, really bad if we do something now. \u201cThis cannot be reversed. We are locked into climate change and we need to work out what we are going to do about it.\u201d Prof Cloke said heatwaves were becoming more frequent, more intense and were lasting longer. She said adaptations would need to be made to cope with rising temperatures. \u201cThe UK Government does need to take it more seriously than they are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cNew houses should be set up to deal with this kind of heat when they are built.\u201d Prof Cloke warned health services could be overwhelmed during the heatwave and there would be risks such as heatstroke and dehydration for everyone, but particularly for the vulnerable and elderly. Dr Mariam Zachariah, research associate at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, said a pattern of record temperatures in recent years showed the impact of climate change. She said: \u201cWhen the globe as a whole warms, heat extremes become frequent and we see more and more higher temperatures happening. This makes heatwaves more intense, prolonged and more frequent.\u201d Professor Ric Williams, research professor in ocean and climate sciences at the University of Liverpool , said: \u201cIf we want to minimise these extreme temperatures and reduce the frequency of them, the only way is to reduce our carbon footprint. \u201cWe are moving in the right direction but could we be moving faster? Absolutely.\u201d At the Cop26 climate change conference last year a target to limit global warming climbing above 1.5C was agreed. Dr Amanda Maycock, director of the Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cWe have got to continue on the path set out by Cop26 last year to stop temperatures rising even further. \u201cIt is going to take time to happen and in the meantime what we need to see is more work towards adaptations and interventions so we can better cope with this kind of extreme event. \u201cThis heatwave is a perfect example of the ways climate change is already affecting us today. \u201cSometimes we view it as happening in the future and as something that will affect our grandchildren, but this reminds us very clearly that climate change is already happening, is already with us today and we are already experiencing the impacts.\u201d The Met Office said the likelihood of extremely hot days in the UK was increasing and would continue to do so during the course of the century. Climate attribution scientist at the Met Office Dr Nikos Christidis said: \u201cThe chances of seeing 40C days in the UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence. \u201cThe likelihood of exceeding 40C anywhere in the UK in a given year has also been rapidly increasing, and, even with current pledges on emissions reductions, such extremes could be taking place every 15 years in the climate of 2100.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

The Conservative Party has rejected net zero scepticism, now the leadership candidates must embrace the future Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A majority think achieving net zero would be good for jobs and the economy The next prime minister will inherit bold environmental promises that voters expect to be honoured. Despite the hopes of a few loud net zero sceptics, and some environmentalists\u2019 fears, the final three contenders for the top job have committed to maintaining those promises and continuing the Conservative Party\u2019s environmental leadership. Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss all signed the Conservative Environment Network\u2019s (CEN) five-point environment pledge, committing to achieve net zero by 2050 and halt the decline of nature by the end of this decade. They also pledged to continue reforms to agricultural subsidies, rollout cheap renewables and support new clean energy technologies. As Conservative MPs narrow down the candidates to the final two for the party membership ballot, it is clear that no contender wants to surrender environmental issues to the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats ahead of the next election. As polling for CEN has shown , two-thirds of Conservative voters are proud the UK is taking a leading role in tackling climate change. A majority think achieving net zero would be good for jobs and the economy. And 27 per cent of the party\u2019s voters from 2019 would likely ditch the party if they weakened the UK\u2019s net zero target. That\u2019s why, in the next round of the leadership contest, the remaining two candidates would be wise to build on the CEN pledge and set out their ideas for improving the environment. They will need to prove their green credentials to voters and show how they will deliver their commitments. I hope we see substantive proposals put forward and debated \u2013 a plan to cut the cost of living through insulating homes and cutting taxes on green products, a manifesto to clean up our rivers by getting tougher with water companies and rewarding nature-friendly farming, or green reforms to EU red tape around innovative clean technologies. Alongside MPs, no one appreciates the strength of public support for environmental action more than the party\u2019s door-knocking members. Public opinion will favour the contender who best embraces net zero as a path to end the UK\u2019s contribution to climate change, cut the cost of living and drive economic growth. Ultimately, the Conservatives are looking for another election winner. MPs and party members know net zero was a key pledge in Boris Johnson\u2019s majority-winning manifesto, but want to see a clear, affordable plan to get there. They also know how important winning new clean industries are to levelling up the red wall and how salient issues like river pollution are in the blue wall. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Not only is the environmental case for going faster on net zero strong, but the economic and security arguments are too. Unless we drastically reduce our emissions, climate change will mean more frequent and more destructive floods , droughts, and heat waves, while rising sea levels will threaten our coastline. So long as we are reliant on expensive and volatile fossil fuels, we will be exposed to inflation-causing energy crunches. And until we decarbonise, we will rely on fossil fuel imports under the malign influence of Vladimir Putin. Building more renewables will power our homes and businesses with cheap, homegrown energy . Insulating more homes will lower bills, while growing the electric car market will soon cut the cost of driving. And new clean industries like carbon capture and clean hydrogen production will grow our economy, bringing jobs and investment to our industrial heartlands. All three leadership candidates understand this opportunity, along with the vast majority of Conservative MPs, not least the half of backbench MPs who have signed up to CEN\u2019s Parliamentary caucus. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen the party reject net zero scepticism . And it\u2019s why in the coming weeks, we can expect to see the final two candidates compete to be the greenest \u2013 to win the party, the country, cut the cost of living and deliver economic growth.

{"id":null,"body":" Perhaps I\u2019m too much of an optimist, but I\u2019ve imagined the future and I\u2019m telling you \u2013 it could be amazing Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Does the discussion around the climate crisis fill you with dread? Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not exactly an uplifting topic, is it \u2013 there\u2019s the word \u201ccrisis\u201d in there, for one. The whole thing sounds terrible : heatwaves , floods , droughts and hurricanes \u2013 and they\u2019re getting larger and worse all the time. Reports of the danger our planet is facing are not meant to be lighthearted. They\u2019re there to alarm, shame or cajole us. But the problem is, this can also have the opposite effect. Most people don\u2019t want to read depressing news all the time , according to research \u2013 they just switch to reading something more fun. Or they change the subject. Authoritative warnings about climate future rarely make front pages, and even at outlets that do give them prominence, they are rarely the most read articles. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can flip the script. Firstly, the climate crisis isn\u2019t a massive, impossible problem that will cost us trillions to deal with. This narrative is out of date. Most of the technology needed to stop this crisis is now available, and it\u2019s far cheaper than burning oil or gas. It would actually save us a lot of money. More importantly, our future isn\u2019t destined to be all wildfires and unprecedented floods, even though this week we have undoubtedly seen the devastation extreme weather events can cause . But we can switch the focus: there are exciting and innovative possibilities that will come with clean energy that hardly anyone talks about. And it\u2019s those possibilities that can excite people and encourage them to take action faster. Let me explain what I mean. Human progress has always depended on exploiting more energy. The discovery of wood, coal, oil and natural gas each unleashed a torrent of innovation and progress \u2013 for example, we can easily travel across our beautiful planet in ways impossible to imagine just a hundred years ago. Modern life would have been impossible without using vast amounts of energy. But we are also constrained by it, because it\u2019s expensive, polluting and finite. And this is the beauty of clean renewable energy: it can be produced surprisingly cheaply, it doesn\u2019t pollute anything and it doesn\u2019t run out. Hold on a second , you might say at this point \u2013 people keep saying this climate change stuff is going to be super expensive, and that you should cut back on everything and live like a caveman. Right? Well, some do say that, but in my opinion they\u2018re both wrong and late to the party. The price of clean energy has fallen by 90 per cent since 2010, and that trend is set to continue. Never in human history have we had access to so much cheap and plentiful energy. Companies in the North Sea are producing electricity from offshore wind farms at a quarter of the price of gas . Solar panels and land-based wind farms are even cheaper than that. China is building vast energy farms in the desert . This is the future we don\u2019t talk about enough. With almost unlimited amounts of cheap, clean energy, we can make unimaginable progress. We could wipe out world hunger and end water shortages by growing food far more cheaply and efficiently under solar-powered LED lights. It is my belief that we will be able to travel to Australia in a quarter of the time for a tenth of the price; that billions of people in developing countries would no longer need to rely on solitary lightbulbs or charcoal to live and make food. And yes, flying into space \u2013 to my mind \u2013 will become the next frontier for carbon-free travel. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Obviously, there are caveats. We have to replace our entire energy and food-making systems, and that will take time and investment. And yes, we will inevitably produce more pollution to manufacture vast numbers of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, but I believe the net effect will be vastly better. Some people think this won\u2019t work because the wind doesn\u2019t blow and sun doesn\u2019t shine all the time, but this, again, feels to me like an outdated view. The answer could be: batteries and backup nuclear power . And don\u2019t forget \u2013 solar panels and wind turbines can produce clean energy for decades without ongoing costs! You don\u2019t have to keep replacing them every few years. In summary, I wholeheartedly believe that cheap, clean energy will bring us a world we can scarcely imagine right now. I am genuinely excited about it, and I think others should be too. Perhaps I\u2019m too much of an optimist, but I\u2019ve imagined the future and I\u2019m telling you it could be amazing. Clean energy will unleash the kind of progress that will make the last 250 years feel like child\u2019s play. I think an optimistic vision of the future \u2013 talking about the benefits of shifting to cheap, abundant clean energy \u2013 won\u2019t just be more interesting to read about, but more likely to encourage people to make the changes we need to combat the climate crisis.

{"id":null,"body":" Broadcaster prompted backlash after his tweet about soaring tempertaures Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Jeremy Clarkson is seemingly unaffected by the recent backlash he received for an \u201cexceptionally stupid\u201d tweet he posted about the ongoing heatwave . On Sunday (17 July), the former Top Gear host shared a tweet which read: \u201cIt\u2019s very hot in the south of France but so far as I know, there\u2019s no DefCon 8 level 3 killer death heatwave warning in place.\u201d His post was widely interpreted as a jab at the UK government\u2019s response to the heatwave, with many responding that his comment was incorrect. However, Clarkson has dismissed the backlash, writing in a new tweet today (18 July): \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life working in extreme heat and we survived by having a beer under a tree. Climate change is real. Drink more beer.\u201d \u201cYeah let\u2019s laugh about climate change,\u201d someone replied. To which the broadcaster quipped back: \u201cWe should laugh about anything we want. Now go and sit under a tree and have a cold beer.\u201d Clarkson\u2019s original tweet received many negative responses, including climate journalist Dave Vetter, who shared a map of European wildfire outbreaks, commenting: \u201cYou could, indeed you have, filled several books with all the stuff you don\u2019t know.\u201d Medical specialist Dr Philip Lee wrote: \u201cThey\u2019ve literally evacuated 14,000 people from Southern France Jeremy. Because it\u2019s on fire.\u201d Someone else described the tweet as \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cignorant\u201d, while another person wrote: \u201cThis is an exceptionally stupid thing to say.\u201d You can follow live updates about the heatwave here .

{"id":null,"body":" It is not possible to gauge sea level rise simply by comparing two images of a location side-by-side, experts said Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A widely shared picture that compares two images of a Sydney tourist attraction 140 years apart to cast doubt on rising sea levels has been debunked. The image shows Fort Denison, part of the Sydney Harbour National Park, in 1878 and 2018 with the caption: \u201cUnprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0cm over the past 140 years.\u201d \u201cThink the photos speak for themselves,\u201d one user said in the comments. However, it is not possible to gauge sea level rise simply by comparing two images of a location side-by-side, experts told Reuters, The claim has also previously been addressed by Climate Feedback , a worldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in climate change media coverage. \u201cSea level is fluctuating on many different timescales from semidiurnal, mixed, and diurnal tidal variations to the long-term sea level change due to climate change,\u201d Beata Csatho, professor and chair of geology at the University at Buffalo and member of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Sea Level Change Team, told Reuters. The picture showing Fort Denison does not reflect actual sea level rises \u201c Long-term sea level change is determined by removing all short-term variations from tide-gauge measurements or ocean altimetry records based on a set of models, such as ocean tide, load tide, inverse barometric effect (the pressure the atmosphere pushes the ocean down), etc,\u201d she said. The images of Fort Denison capture the ocean elevation \u201conly at two particular moments\u201d, Csatho said. \u201cImagine that the first picture was taken at high tide and the second one was taken at low tide. The apparent change could look like dropping sea level, while actually, the sea level is slowly rising. \u201cThe complexity of sea level elevation changes necessitated the use of a network of continuously recording tide gauging around the world, now supplemented by satellites that are constantly monitoring sea level,\u201d Prof Csatho added. The photographs may reflect \u201cdifferent tidal stages\u201d, Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Reuters. A global rate of sea-level rise has been recorded since 1993 by orbiting satellites, Prof Griggs said. \u201cThis rate has averaged 3.42 mm\/yr but over the past decade or so has increased to 4.77mm\/yr over the past 10 years,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":" Rising night-time temperatures could lead to immune system damage and higher heart disease risk Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile The risk of death from excessively hot nights could increase nearly six-fold by the end of the century, according to a new study that explains how rising night-time temperatures due to climate change may disrupt the human body\u2019s physiology . Scientists, including those from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill in the US, say disruption of sleep in people across the world brought on by climate change could lead to immune system damage and a higher risk of heart disease, chronic illnesses, inflammation, and mental health conditions. The study, published last week in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health, found that the average intensity of hot night events would nearly double by 2090, from 20.4C (68.7F) to 39.7C (103.5F) across 28 cities.

{"id":null,"body":" Scientists hope warnings of \u2018disastrous knock-on effects\u2019 will galvanise global response to emergency Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A wildfire in Thailand in 2020. Wildfire risks have increased here and in many parts of the world due to hotter drier conditions The scientists are not mincing their words: we should now look at the possibility of total human extinction due to the climate crisis. Following a spectacularly bleak warning that humans must prepare for a \u201cclimate endgame,\u201d after failing to properly explore what the climate crisis is bringing, scientists from leading institutions are banding together to seek support for what could be a major change in tack in how human-driven global environmental collapse is viewed. Calling for a new report from the UN\u2019s IPCC on \u201ccatastrophic climate change ,\u201d they hope that explaining the horror coming down the line will galvanise the global response to the crisis which is currently almost non-existent. Speaking to The Independent , lead author of the research, Dr Luke Kemp from Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, said the climate crisis has been a factor not only in all known mass extinction events the world has seen, but has also played a critical role in the collapse of many human societies. \u201cWe know that in the long-term climate change is capable of causing mass extinctions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that we could plausibly hit concentrations of greenhouse gases by the end of the century which are consistent with the triggering of past mass extinctions. \u201cClimate change has the potential to erase much of the biosphere and change the trajectory of life.\u201d He said in the past mass extinctions have been due to climatic changes which trigger a process called ocean hypoxia \u2013 warmer waters hold less oxygen leading to the growth of so-called \u201cdead zones\u201d, which can spread, leading to the deaths of huge numbers of species. But today\u2019s climate crisis is occurring harder and faster than any other global climatic change before. \u201cWhat is more disturbing is what we do not know,\u201d Dr Kemp said. \u201cCurrent climate change is geologically unprecedented \u2013 it is faster than the changes involved in past mass extinctions. \u201cMass extinction events are already an incredibly high bar \u2013 climate change will likely be a global catastrophic risk for humans well before it reaches mass extinction levels.\u201d Ocean Rebellion climate protesters in Brussels. Scientists have warned warming waters are causing \u201cdead zones\u201d in the sea Professor Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter, a co-author of the study, agrees. Asked if governments\u2019 failure to take the required action on the climate crisis was plotting a course to major instability in the near future, he said: \u201cYes \u2013 and I think it will be of the cascading risk kind. \u201cWe are suffering unprecedented heatwaves and fires already. The fires in Europe last week are already causing people to move to get away from them. \u201cCurrent policies globally are taking us to a nearly 3C warmer world in which billions of people could be on the move. Alas we know that large scale movement of people is not widely welcomed and can often trigger conflict.\u201d Dr Kemp said examples of past societal collapses and crises which bear the fingerprint of the climate crisis include the demise of the Lowland Maya, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the Late Bronze Age collapse, which included the fall of the Mycenae Greek and the Hittite Empire. \u201cImpacts such as drought and migration appear to have led to a series of disastrous knock-on effects in the late Bronze Age world system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt destabilised the trade system and likely spurred war, rebellion, and declining state revenues. \u201cLike the modern-world, the Bronze Age Mediterranean was a system of states that were densely connected through trade and politics. It was also an unequal world, and its interconnectedness allowed for climate impacts to spiral into systemic breakdown.\u201d Low water levels at Bewl Water reservoir in Lamberhurst, Kent, following record heat While Dr Kemp said each individual case was complex and increasing droughts and changes in temperature \u201cdo not automatically lead to societal breakdown\u201d, he warned \u201cthe lesson is that already fragile societies can be deeply damaged and even upended by climatic variation\u201d. He added: \u201cThe scariest part is that the past climatic variations were largely natural and modest. We now face rapid, pervasive, and severe man-made climate change. The risk is enormously larger than what past societies had to weather.\u201d Speaking about the call for a greater exploration of the threats we face, Dr Kemp said previous campaigns highlighting the deadly risks of nuclear war had helped build support for nuclear disarmament, and in the case of the climate crisis could help our societies better prepare and plan how to respond. \u201cUnderstanding plausible worst-cases can propel public action,\u201d he said. \u201cStudying the climate endgame is not an advocacy effort. It is sane risk management. \u201cUnderstanding extreme climate risks can help prevent them and build resilience. Comprehending climate catastrophe is necessary to have a fully informed democratic discussions, including of emergency responses.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Todd Smith quit being a pilot because of the aviation industry\u2019s carbon footprint A former pilot has opened up about quitting the aviation industry after he learned about the climate damage caused by flying . Todd Smith, from London, flew holidaymakers across Europe for three years before a gut inflammation temporarily grounded him in 2018. A doctor advised him to quit eating meat and he agreed to a plant-based diet , leading him to investigate the way animal farming affects the environment. Intrigued, the former electrician then began investigating climate science and the carbon footprint of plane travel, which is responsible for more than 2 per cent of global emissions and tried to talk to colleagues about his fears. He told German news site DW: \u201cI was struck by the injustice of it all. Especially since half of those emissions are generated by 1 per cent of the population.\u201d \u201cAt the time, Greta Thunberg was the focus of all these vile comments. I actually think the industry felt really threatened by her. She was walking the walk.\u201d He joined the Extinction Rebellion protest movement, and eventually became a spokesperson for the movement. Todd has also set up an organisation called Safe-Landing with other aviation workers who share his fears to pressure industry leaders to \u201cconform with climate science and reject dangerous growth\u201d. \u201cWith the remaining carbon budget we have, we can\u2019t continue to double air traffic every 15 years, like we have historically,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to empower aviation workers to understand that we need to fly less if we want to ensure a long-term future in the industry,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":" Exclusive: Nearly 70 per cent of respondents said the climate crisis should be one of the government\u2019s top priorities Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Nearly seven in 10 people say the UK\u2019s record-breaking heatwave has convinced them more needs to be done to tackle the climate crisis but many remain unpersuaded to take personal action, according to a new poll. The exclusive Savanta survey for The Independent \u00a0reveals that people are looking to the government to take action, while fewer said the heatwave had persuaded them to change their own behaviour when it comes to eating less meat and dairy, flying less or investing in electric cars and heat pumps \u2013 all of which reduce emissions and therefore global heating. Sixty-nine per cent of the 2,315 respondents said they were either significantly or somewhat more convinced the country needed to do more to tackle climate change which is fuelling longer, hotter and more frequent heatwaves. The same proportion said the climate crisis should be one of the government\u2019s top priorities. Firefighters rest as they attend a gorse bush fire, during a heatwave near Zennor, Cornwall, on 19 July The proportion of people who said the heatwave had left them more convinced that the UK had to up its action on climate was similar across different socio-economic groups, suggesting the experience of the heatwave was an eye-opener for many Britons . Politicians and behaviour experts say it is not surprising people are looking to the government for action , with opposition MPs and campaigners slamming Britain\u2019s leaders for not going far enough. Thermometers in Coningsby in Lincolnshire hit 40.3C , setting a new all-time temperature record in the UK, and it\u2019s been estimated that nearly 1,000 excess deaths could be recorded due to the heat from 17 to 19 July. The poll results found some proportional differences along gender, regional and political lines. Seventy-five per cent of women said they were more convinced more action is needed compared to 63 per cent of men. London, which saw 34 grass fires tear through homes and businesses last week, was the region with the highest proportion at 78 per cent, while Northern Ireland had the lowest at 55 per cent. When it came to personal action, 30 per cent of respondents said the heatwave had persuaded them to eat less meat, 32 per cent were persuaded to fly less and 36 per cent said the heat had persuaded them to invest in an electric car. \u201cPeople are right to look to government for leadership,\u201d said Zac Goldsmith, the international environment minister. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much individuals can do, but governments set the rules within which the market operates and unless and until the market is made to recognise the risks of environmental damage and the value of a healthy planet, we will continue moving rapidly in the wrong direction.\u201d Two women dip their heads into the fountain to cool off in Trafalgar Square on 19 July Conservative leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been widely criticised by environmentalists and climate campaigners for not giving the crisis enough prominence in their campaigns to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cPeople rightly expect the government to lead the way on the climate crisis, but far too often this government does much too little while expecting individuals to pick up the slack,\u201d said Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. \u201cMore than ever before, the public want politicians to take real action to halt climate change yet all they get from Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak is weak rhetoric and backward-looking ideas.\u201d Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said the Conservatives were \u201cout of touch\u201d with the British public on the climate crisis and that the government needed to urgently invest in insulating peoples\u2019 homes and accelerate the rollout of renewable energy. Richard Carmichael, a psychologist and behaviour expert for several government-funded projects related to consumers and net zero, said he was optimistic about the proportion of people saying they had been persuaded to invest in an electric car or invest in a heat pump \u2013 23 per cent. \u201cThat\u2019s enough really,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market responds.\u201d A police officer offers a bottle of water to a police horse named Zack during hot weather, on 18 July Dr Carmichael said government policy and business had a role to play in making action easier, fairer and more affordable. Making other people\u2019s green decisions more visible to help behaviour catch on quicker was also important, he said, pointing to the green flash on electric vehicle number plates as a good example. There are valid reasons why people may not be persuaded to buy heat pumps or fly less, he said. The former may be too expensive, and even before the pandemic, around half of the English population didn\u2019t fly in 2018, so asking those people to fly less when there are some frequent fliers may strike them as unfair, he explained. The government\u2019s net zero strategy states it will \u201cwork in the grain of consumer choice\u201d, meaning no one will be required to rip out an existing boiler or scrap their current car. Cameron Smith, a spokesman for the Conservative Environment Network, said a conservative approach which sets bold targets to drive private investment would reduce the cost of insulation, heat pumps and electric cars, so the green option is not only the cheapest but the best. \u201cThat\u2019s how we can reduce our emissions and bring people with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you tried to tackle climate change by depriving people of meat, travel or banning boilers, public willingness to act would unravel.\u201d A UK government spokesperson said the UK was \u201cleading the world on climate change\u201d, driving down emissions by 44 per cent since 1990 and growing the economy \u2013 \u201cwhich is more than any other G7 country\u201d. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ve increased the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid, rising by 500 per cent since 2010 and our\u00a0British Energy Security Strategy\u00a0will put Great Britain at the leading edge of the global energy revolution,\u201d the spokesperson added.

{"id":null,"body":" The legislation \u2013 which would be the largest investment yet in combating the climate crisis \u2013 now heads to the House of Representatives. Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Senate Democrats passed their signature legislation tackling the climate crisis and prescription drug prices early on Sunday morning, sending the legislation to the House of Representatives. The legislation, known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 would be the biggest step that the US government has taken to cut domestic emissions at a moment when global targets are faltering. It will also allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, cap the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients and continue subsidies for Obamacare. The vote came after a marathon series of votes known as a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d that began late Saturday evening and went well into Sunday afternoon. All 48 Democrats and two independents voted for the legislation along with Vice-president Kamala Harris, while all Republicans voted against. \u201cThis is an example of leaders leading, understanding that there are solutions at hand, if folks have the willingness and the courage to actually step forward and fix the problem,\u201d Ms Harris told The Independent . The legislation now heads to the House of Representatives, where it will likely pass if only 9 of Democrats\u2019 220 members oppose it. The White House said President Joe Biden would sign the bill. The legislation comes after Democrats have spent more than a year attempting to pass Mr Biden\u2019s signature domestic legislation. Mr Biden initially hoped to pass a massive social spending bill that included spending on an expanded child tax credit; home care for people with disabilities; expanded hearing coverage for Medicare recipients; immigration reform; and more robust efforts to combat the climate crisis and promote clean energy. They hoped to pass it alongside his bipartisan infrastructure bill. But Senator Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat from West Virginia, announced his opposition legislation known as Build Back Better in December. That led to on-and-off-again negotiations between Mr Manchin and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer. Late last month, Mr Schumer and Mr Manchin announced a deal known as the Inflation Reduction Act, a nod to Mr Manchin\u2019s concern about rising prices. It will also boost the US\u2019s credibility on the international stage as Mr Biden plans to head to Egypt for COP27, where he will demand that other major emitters in China, Europe, and beyond, sharply cut their own fossil fuel use. The bill proposes $369bn in climate and clean energy investments, including billions of dollars for tax incentives to expand renewable energy, battery storage and nuclear power over the next 10 years. The legislation also provides tax credits to make it easier to buy electric vehicles, help farmers cut agricultural emissions, and fund improvements in minority and low-income communities who are most harmed by climate and environmental pollution. Several new analyses of the IRA, from independent policy groups, found that it would cut emissions about 40 per cent (below 2005 levels) by the end of the decade. It puts the US within striking distance of Mr Biden's pledge to cut US emissions in half by 2030. Some climate activists and environmental groups objected to aspects of the bill that were necessary to get Mr Manchin, who has made a fortune from his state\u2019s coal industry, on board, such as a requirement that the government auction off leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and water, including in the Gulf of Mexico and in Alaska. Coal and gas plants that use carbon-capture technology will also get expanded tax credits. Mr Manchin was given a separate promise that the permitting progress would be sped up with the Mountain Valley gas pipeline in West Virginia. At the same time, many Democratic Senators said they would not vote on any amendments to the legislation recognising it as the only chance to pass any major climate legislation. Many Democrats also expressed excitement about the fact that it would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. But the Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough issued guidance weakening part of the legislation that would force drug companies to rebate Medicare if they raised drug prices higher than inflation. The parliamentarian delivered another blow to Democrats when she announced that the plan to cap insulin for private insurance patients to $35 did not follow the rules of budget reconciliation. That led to Republicans raising a point of order to strip it out of the bill. Democrats would have needed to earn 60 votes to keep the price of insulin at $35 for private insurance patients in the legislation, but only seven Republicans voted to keep it in. Similarly, Republican Senate minority whip John Thune tried to include a carve-out for the Democrats\u2019 proposed corporate minimum tax for certain companies affiliated with private equity, as a means to coax conservative Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. However, the amendment would have put the legislation in jeopardy in the House because it continued a cap on state and local tax deductions put in place during the Trump tax cuts, which many Democrats in New York, New Jersey and California oppose. Six Democrats joined Ms Sinema, including Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia; Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada; Mark Kelly of Arizona; and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia offered a substitute amendment that passed with all Democratic votes. Despite the setbacks, Democrats passed the legislation early Sunday evening. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, who as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is in charge of electing Democrats and protecting incumbents, said the prescription drug aspect will help Democrats on the campaign trail. \u201cIf you look at polling is like the number one issue for most people in the country right now,\u201d he told The Independent during the vote to begin debate on the bill. Democrats also received a life raft when Republicans did not raise a point of order to take out the part of the legislation that would allow for non-Medicare patients to have their insulin costs capped. Senator Bernie Sanders, who criticised the bill as insufficient, proposed an amendment to allow for Medicare to negotiate all drug prices instead of just 10 drugs initially by 2024 and 20 drugs by 2029. \u201cI think it is absolutely imperative that this Congress, at least on a party, say we understand the crises facing working families, and we're gonna stand with them, and we're gonna vote for some serious amendments to improve this bill,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday afternoon. But Mr Sanders\u2019s amendment on drug prices, as well as an amendment to include dental, hearing and vision care to Medicare coverage, both failed with most Democrats opposing the legislation. Despite the internal dissent, many Democrats hailed the passage of the bill. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said it showed that Democrats could take on special interest groups. \u201cI mean, this is the first time when you think about this, we took on, we took on the drug companies who never lose. We took on the oil companies who never, who rarely lose and we took on Wall Street and we were winning on all three and how important that is,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":" 'We must do the math of disaster in order to avoid it', say international team of scientists Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Destroyed street after an earthquake in Haiti. 'Paths to disaster are not limited to the impacts of high temperatures', the team warned Despite decades of warnings from the world\u2019s best scientists that soaring greenhouse gas emissions are driving the planet ever closer to catastrophe, the magnitude of the perils ahead remain \"dangerously underexplored\", experts have warned. An international team of researchers led by the University of Cambridge have said that \"catastrophic\" scenarios could be triggered by global heating worse than many have predicted, or by cascading impacts of events \u2013 or both at once. As a result, they have said the world must start preparing for the possibility of a \" climate endgame\" for our species. In order to fully assess the array of risks, the team has proposed a research agenda for facing up to bad-to-worst-case scenarios. These include outcomes ranging from a loss of 10 per cent of the global population to complete human extinction. The researchers are calling on the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to dedicate a future report to \"catastrophic climate change\", which they hope will galvanise research and inform the public. \u201cThere are plenty of reasons to believe climate change could become catastrophic, even at modest levels of warming,\u201d said lead author Dr Luke Kemp from Cambridge\u2019s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. \u201cClimate change has played a role in every mass extinction event. It has helped fell empires and shaped history. Even the modern world seems adapted to a particular climate niche,\u201d he said. \u201cPaths to disaster are not limited to the direct impacts of high temperatures, such as extreme weather events. Knock-on effects such as financial crises, conflict, and new disease outbreaks could trigger other calamities, and impede recovery from potential disasters such as nuclear war.\u201d Dr Kemp and his colleagues have said that the consequences of 3C warming and beyond, and related extreme risks, have been under-examined. Modelling done by the team shows areas of extreme heat - an annual average temperature of over 29C - could affect two billion people by 2070. These areas are not only some of the most densely populated but also some of the most politically fragile. \u201cAverage annual temperatures of 29 degrees currently affect around 30 million people in the Sahara and Gulf Coast,\u201d said co-author Chi Xu of Nanjing University. Abandoned houses in Hong Kong. Scientists say we need to examine the bad-to-worst-case climate scenarios more closely \u201cBy 2070, these temperatures and the social and political consequences will directly affect two nuclear powers, and seven maximum containment laboratories housing the most dangerous pathogens. There is serious potential for disastrous knock-on effects,\u201d he said. Last year\u2019s IPCC report suggested that if atmospheric carbon dioxide doubles from pre-industrial levels \u2013 something the planet is halfway towards \u2013 then there is a roughly 18 per cent chance temperatures will rise more than 4.5C. The research team said the scientific community\u2019s current methodology has a growing tendency to examine less risky future scenarios which require a smaller-scale response. Dr Kemp co-authored a \u201ctext mining\u201d study of existing IPCC reports, published earlier this year , which found that IPCC assessments have shifted away from high-end warming to increasingly focus on lower temperature rises. This builds on previous work \u00a0he has done showing that extreme temperature scenarios are \u201cunderexplored relative to their likelihood\u201d. \u201cWe know least about the scenarios that matter most,\u201d Dr Kemp said. The team has now proposed a research agenda including what they call the \u201cfour horsemen\u201d of the climate endgame. These are: famine and malnutrition, extreme weather, conflict, and vector-borne diseases. Global food supplies face huge risks from hotter climates, according to the team, with increasing probabilities of \u201cbreadbasket failures\u201d as the world\u2019s most agriculturally productive areas suffer \"collective meltdowns\". Hotter and more extreme weather could also create conditions for new disease outbreaks as habitats for both people and wildlife shift and shrink. The experts also warned that environmental breakdown will likely exacerbate other \u201cinteracting threats\u201d. They highlighted rising levels of inequality, misinformation, the potential for democratic breakdowns and even new forms of destructive artificial intelligence (AI) weaponry. One dystopian scenario envisaged in the paper is described as \u201cwarm wars\u201d \u2013 in which technologically-enhanced superpowers fight for dwindling carbon space while also conducting giant experiments to deflect sunlight and reduce global temperatures. The team said there needs to be a greater focus on identifying all potential tipping points which could push us towards a \u201cHothouse Earth\u201d. These include methane being released by permafrost melts to the loss of forests that act as \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d, and even the potential for vanishing cloud cover. \u201cThe more we learn about how our planet functions, the greater the reason for concern,\u201d said co-author Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \u201cWe increasingly understand that our planet is a more sophisticated and fragile organism. We must do the math of disaster in order to avoid it,\u201d he said. Dr Kemp added: \u201cWe know that temperature rise has a \u2018fat tail\u2019, which means a wide range of lower probability but potentially extreme outcomes. Facing a future of accelerating climate change while remaining blind to worst-case scenarios is naive risk-management at best and fatally foolish at worst.\u201d The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

{"id":null,"body":"Join the news democracy Where your votes decide the Top 100 We're just a week removed from the hottest heatwave the UK has ever experienced with temperatures exceeding 40c in some parts of the country leading to devastating wildfires. Parts of Europe also saw their highest temperature records not only beaten but completely obliterated. Not that the subject should have ever gone away but the heatwave has reignited the conversation around climate change and the toll that it is taking on the planet because let's be honest, the UK and other countries in Europe just aren't equipped for this kind of weather. However, unless dramatic changes are made soon then the summer's in the UK will only continue to get hotter and hotter, causing even more damage. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter With this in mind, it's worth looking at what the experts say about how climate change is likely to completely change our lives if it progresses at its current rate. According to a study published by the University of Maryland published last year, US cities are set to heat up quite a bit by 2080. The city of Denver, Colorado, is predicted to become as hot and wet as Borger, Texas and Philadelphia will feel warmer and drier, like Memphis, Tennessee. New York City will be up to 5C warmer. Chandana Mitra, an associate professor of geosciences at Auburn University, who studies the impact of heat on cities told the Guardian : \"Maybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable. There could be a tipping point of no return.\" The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that from 1999 to 2010 an average of 658 people die every year from heat-related causes. The young, elderly and poorer communities are most vulnerable, and air pollution in cities exacerbates heat problems. In 2019, a simultaneous malfunction at an offshore wind farm and gas facility caused a power cut in the UK. National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) officials said the lightning strike hit a transmission circuit at 4.52pm on 9th August in a \u201crare\u201d event. Extreme weather conditions are set to increase over the years due to climate change, and this could increase the frequency of power cuts and blackouts. In 2018, African nations faced blackouts as rising temperatures dried up their hydropower dams. Heat could impact city infrastructure, especially if officials aren\u2019t prepared for the rising heat temperatures. Airlines in Phoenix, Arizona cancelled some 40 flights as temperatures hit 48C in 2017. In 2019, the Environment Agency has warned England\u2019s flood planners to prepare for the worst on climate change. Emma Howard Boyd, the chairwoman, said on current trends global temperature could rise between 2C and 4C by 2100 and \u00a31bn needs to be spent on flood management. She said that some communities may even need to move because of the risk of floods: \"[In some places] the scale of the threat may be so significant that recovery will not always be the best long term solution [and communities would need help to] move out of harm's way.\" According to the Climate Reality Project , dirty fossil fuel emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect can lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma in both children and adults. Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, according to the World Health Organisation. Asthma UK lists a number of triggers for asthma sufferers, including extreme hot or cold weather and thunderstorms. The Climate Reality Project warns: \"The same CO2 accumulating in our atmosphere thanks to fossil fuels is actually changing the composition of fruits and vegetables that we eat, making them less nutritious. \"Extra CO2 is speeding up photosynthesis and causing plants to grow with more sugar and less calcium, protein, zinc, and important vitamins. \"According to Harvard researchers , if we don\u2019t reduce carbon emissions right now, this could spell big problem for our diets. By the middle of the century about 175 million more people could develop a zinc deficiency and 122 million people could become protein deficient as a result of these changes to plant physiology.\" A dire warning...

{"id":null,"body":" It\u2019s too late to wait for governments \u2013 we need to start acting, in the communities where we live, in the places where we work, to make ourselves resilient Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Last month, I was listening to an acquaintance talking about the weather , the way one does, in England. And then she said: \u201cI hope it stays like this all summer because it will be just like being abroad.\u201d I pondered this statement in silence, not really sure what to say next. Admittedly, this was just before the UK set a new all-time temperature record last month. Perhaps having experienced such extreme heat in a country wholly unprepared for it, that woman might no longer feel the same? Over the past few months more and more people, somewhat reluctantly perhaps, are realising we are in deep and deepening trouble. This summer, dwarfing 1976 as it already does in its extremity, is the mother of all wake-up calls. So far. However, it\u2019s not enough to simply worry about rivers running dry or to shake our heads as much of our green and pleasant land turns yellow and burns, or as crops suffer and fail. The climate crisis isn\u2019t just on our doorstep now, it\u2019s through the front door and sat on the welcome mat \u2013 and, unwelcome though it is, it won\u2019t be leaving. It\u2019s here, and this means that action is unavoidable. And remember: this is only the beginning. Climate breakdown and the devastation of the Earth is the most compelling issue of our time. It is the issue that envelops all others. How we respond to it is going to be the only thing that our kids care about when they think of us when they are older. So, what I sometimes struggle to understand is, why aren\u2019t nearly all our efforts, our time and our money going into battling this deep and deepening crisis? Why are communities, countries and the world not uniting, as they did for example during the global pandemic, to try and sort this out? Or at least make things less bad. As we sit in the throes of yet another UK heatwave today, what will it take to liberate action, at scale? We are potential agents of change \u2013 and we have no idea what we are capable of until we try. Why aren\u2019t we trying? You only have to look at the world headlines to know this isn\u2019t an isolated problem. In California, Death Valley , normally the driest place in North America, saw flash floods after record rainfall (almost a year\u2019s worth in three hours). Closer to home in Europe, thousands of people have been evacuated as out-of-control wildfires \u201ctear through southwest France\u201d. The deadly heatwave is also putting pressure on already strained power infrastructure as people try to keep cool. English tourists are sweltering in Spain \u2013 as the government bans air conditioning units from being set below 27 degrees to save power. The list goes on and on. Enough of lists. I think you know what to do . It\u2019s too late to wait for governments to act adequately: they don\u2019t intend to. We need to start acting, in the communities where we live, in the places where we work, to make ourselves resilient. To adapt, transformatively, to our deteriorating climate. What kind of thing do I have in mind? Well, what\u2019s being done by the emerging, inspiring network of Climate Emergency Centres , for starters. One-stop shops for anyone and everyone who wants to start making needful changes, from the ground up. The idea is that these centres provide a space for uniting communities in finding solutions to environmental problems at a local level. Why not get involved?

From Fiduciaries for the Future , who are making money green, to the emerging network of academics bolstering climate change research and teaching via Faculty for a Future . And then there are the parents like @heymothership who are trying to give their kids a future by promoting practical tips on things you can do for the planet every day. This is the change we need \u200b\u200b\u2013 from everyone. The time has come when we need to become not just activists, but doists .

We spend so much time on what\u2019s in front of us, we can miss the bigger picture. Alarm bells are going off across the world. We need to hear them. An extreme heatwave and drought has been roasting China for 70 days straight, something that \u201chas no parallel in modern record-keeping in China, or elsewhere around the world for that matter.\u201d Next door, in Pakistan , a \u201ctorrential downpour of biblical proportions\u201d has so far killed 900 people and destroyed nearly 100,000 homes. Its neighbour India has suffered 200 heatwave days this year so far, compared to just 32 last year . South Korea received it\u2019s\u00a0 the heaviest hourly downpour in Seoul for 80 years , flooding the capital and leaving 50 cities and towns with landslide warnings . The West has not been spared of course. The July heatwave that blanketed the US set 350 high temperature records across the country and killed more people than other extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes. Europe is going through the worst drought in 500 years , and England has experienced the worst drought and heatwave since 1976. The expected thunderstorms just add to the sense of unpredictability. These can\u2019t all be coincidences. When was the last time our world was rocked by so many extreme weather events at the same time? Of course, it\u2019s the impact of the climate crisis and just a sign of what\u2019s to come. The immediate impact will be felt on those affected by the heat, droughts and floods. But, just like a tsunami, there are bigger waves to come that will do far more damage. China\u2019s heatwave didn\u2019t just destroy or damage large parts of its best farmland \u2013 it dried up hundreds of rivers, including parts of the Yangtze, the world\u2019s third-largest river. That has put a halt to shipping and hydropower, and forced many companies to shut down. China will need to import large amounts of food and energy to make up for its shortfall, adding more stress to an already-stressed world. The same problem has plagued Germany this summer as rivers have dried up, hitting transport, energy production, wildlife and farming . Sky-high energy prices in the meantime are already having a ruinous impact on businesses across the Eurozone and the world. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by\u00a0 clicking here The alarm bells are going off everywhere. We can\u2019t carry on ignoring them. The climate crisis won\u2019t just be felt in heatwaves, droughts and floods \u2013 it will be felt through rocketing food, goods and energy prices. It will be felt through famines, water shortages and millions of people moving across the world to stave off hunger. The climate crisis will be felt through a world far more destabilised than it is already. We are at a tipping point. Unless governments and companies are pushed to cut carbon emissions far quicker, the world as we know it will fall apart in front of our eyes. The speed at which a society can collapse \u2013 if basic goods such as food, water and energy become scarce \u2013 will shock us. Forget 2030, or even net-zero in 2050, we cannot afford to wait that long. If we cannot heed those blaring sirens now, by the next time it will be too late.

{"id":null,"body":" Majorities of US adults think the government and corporations have a significant responsibility to address climate crisis Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Americans are less concerned now about how climate change might impact them personally \u2014 and about how their personal choices affect the climate \u2014 than they were three years ago, a new poll shows, even as a wide majority still believe climate change is happening. The June Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, which was conducted before Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Friday, shows majorities of US adults think the government and corporations have a significant responsibility to address climate change. The new law will invest nearly $375 billion in climate strategies over the next decade. Overall, 35 per cent of US adults say they are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the impact of climate change on them personally, down from 44 per cent in August 2019. Another third say they are somewhat concerned. Only about half say their actions have an effect on climate change, compared with two-thirds in 2019. Black and Hispanic Americans, women and Democrats are especially likely to be strongly concerned about the impact of climate change on them personally and about how their personal choices affect the climate. Many climate scientists told The Associated Press that the shifts are concerning but not surprising given that individuals are feeling overwhelmed by a range of issues, now including an economy plagued by inflation after more than two years of a pandemic. In addition to being outpaced by other issues, climate change or the environment are mentioned as priorities by fewer Americans now than just a few years ago, according to the poll. Diane Panicucci in West Warwick, Rhode Island , believes climate change is happening and that it needs to be addressed. But for her, it\u2019s a lower priority compared with other issues, including inflation and food and drug costs. \u201cThere\u2019s so much unrest in this country right now,\u201d the 62-year-old said. \u201cPeople are suffering.\u201d Panicucci added solar panels to her house, and she\u2019s cut back on driving. She thinks individuals should do what they\u2019re told will help, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t start with little ol\u2019 me. It has to be larger scale,\u201d she said. While the climate crisis will require an \u201call of the above approach,\u201d it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d that individuals don\u2019t feel they have the bandwidth to tackle climate action \u201con top of everything else,\u201d said Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown University for Environment and Society. Roughly two-thirds of Americans say the U.S. federal government, developed countries abroad and corporations and industries have a large responsibility to address climate change. Fewer \u2014 45 per cent \u2014 say that of individual people. Jack Hermanson, a 23-year-old software engineer, feels strongly that corporations are the \u201cmajor culprits\u201d of emissions and that the government is complicit in that behavior. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that makes sense to say that individuals should have to work and fix the climate,\u201d the Denver resident said. \u201cI would say my individual actions hardly mean anything at all.\" U.S. household greenhouse gas emissions are not as much as those from cars, trucks and other transportation, electrical power generating and industry. A 2020 University of Michigan study of 93 million U.S. homes estimates that 20% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions comes from home energy use, with wealthier Americans\u2019 per capita footprints about 25% higher than low-income residents. But like many others that spoke to the AP, that difference hasn\u2019t stopped Hermanson from trying. He\u2019s been a vegetarian for four years, and he tries to bike or take public transportation, buy products with less packaging and recycle. Among Americans who believe in climate change, 70% say it will be necessary for individuals to make major lifestyle changes to combat the issue. Most think individuals have at least some responsibility. Individuals can believe they personally don\u2019t have a direct impact while also recognizing that collective action is essential to combatting climate change, said Shahzeen Attari, who studies human behavior and climate change at Indiana University. The poll shows about 6 in 10 Americans say they have reduced their driving, reduced their use of heat or air conditioning and bought used products instead of new ones. Nearly three-quarters are using energy efficient appliances. Among those who are taking those steps, most say the main reason is to save money, rather than to help the environment. Fewer \u2014 roughly a quarter \u2014 say they use an electricity supplier that gets power from renewable sources, and only about 1 in 10 live in a home with solar panels or drive a hybrid or electric car. Brad Machincia, a 38-year-old welder, said he wouldn\u2019t switch from his gas car to an electric vehicle. While he said he grew up in a West Virginia household that used renewable energy sources, he hasn\u2019t adopted those practices for his family in Christiansburg, Virginia. Climate change used to be a concern for him, but at this point, he feels like it's \u201cbeating a dead horse.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to fix it,\u201d he said. Individuals should feel empowered to make climate-driven decisions that not only help reduce emissions but also improve their lives, said Jonathan Foley, executive director at climate nonprofit Project Drawdown. Foley thinks the findings show that efforts to engage Americans need to shift away from doomsday scenarios, include diverse messengers and focus on the ways climate solutions can intersect with Americans' other priorities. Julio Carmona, a 37-year-old financial clerk, said he recently transitioned his home in Bridgeport, Connecticut , to solar energy because the switch will help reduce his carbon footprint and his expenses, even if modestly. \u201cI thought that it was just something smart for us to do long term,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kind of wanted to do my part, whether or not it\u2019s gonna make a difference.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" All across the world, global heating is transforming wind patterns and making them much harder to predict. That means passenger flights are becoming less safe and efficient, as well as giving off more emissions themselves, as Vishwam Sankaran reports Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile \u201cIt all happened in a span of 5 to 7 minutes,\u201d says Hemal Rajesh Doshi, one of the 195 passengers aboard the Boeing 737-800 flight operated by Indian airline SpiceJet that encountered severe turbulence flying to Kolkata from Mumbai on 1 May this year. The incident left 14 passengers and three of the flight\u2019s cabin crew injured. \u201cAbout an hour and a half into the flight, without any announcement, it was like the plane suddenly fell and passengers were in panic. I saw about four to five passengers literally thrown into the air and some hit the flight\u2019s roof and fell. The moment was like being on a roller coaster,\u201d Mr Doshi tells The Independent, recounting what he calls a \u201dhorrible, life-threatening\u201d experience aboard the plane. While the results of an official investigation into the incident are pending, experts suspect the plane may have encountered a severe localised thunderstorm called a Nor\u2019wester while trying to steer clear of erratic air currents shortly before landing. \u201cThe pilot deviated to his left in order to avoid turbulence but did not get alerted about the upcoming issue in his deviated path,\u201d SpiceJet said in a statement at the time. A growing number of studies indicate that erratic air circulation patterns like these are aggravated by the climate crisis , and the results can have serious implications for passenger safety. In March 2019, a Boeing 777 flight operated by Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to New York encountered an incident of severe clear-air turbulence (CAT) over Maine, hospitalising 30 people , including a flight attendant who suffered a broken leg. CAT is caused by an erratic wind current occurring in the cloudless regions of the sky at about the cruising altitude of passenger jets. It is generated by wind shear \u2013 a change in the direction and velocity of winds that can displace aircraft abruptly from their intended path. Experts say thunderstorms and atmospheric phenomena like CAT and jet streams are already being influenced by global heating, leading to the likelihood of more disruptions in airline operations. Thousands of planes already experience severe turbulence every year, costing the aviation sector up to $1bn annually through flight delays, structural damage to aircraft and injuries to passengers and cabin crew. \u201c Climate change is going to have many effects on aviation. We expect the atmosphere to become more turbulent. So there could be possibly twice or three times as much turbulence on flights in the next few decades,\u201d Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, tells The Independent. Emerging evidence suggests non-uniform temperature changes caused by the climate crisis are disrupting the flow of air currents in the atmosphere due to changes in wind speed and direction. One such current airplanes routinely use to assist transcontinental flights is the Atlantic jet stream \u2013 a fast, narrow current of air flowing from west to east that encircles the globe. Airplanes, especially those travelling east from North America, use this jet stream to cut down on their travel times and fuel use in the same way turtles in the movie Finding Nemo use the East Australian ocean current for migration, explains Krishna AchutaRao, head of the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. \u201cWe know that the jet stream at flight cruising altitudes has become 15 per cent more sheared over the North Atlantic since satellites began observing it in the 1970s,\u201d Dr Williams says. A 2017 study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences , looked at the impact of stronger wind shear \u2013 an abrupt change in wind speed or direction over a short distance that is a major cause of turbulence \u2013 on winter-time transatlantic flights. It found that the doubling of global CO 2 levels will increase the average amount of severe CAT at 39,000ft by 149 per cent, meaning airline passengers will have a bumpier ride in the future if emissions continue unabated. Improved turbulence forecasting capabilities will be needed so route changes to avoid turbulence do not lead to increased fuel burn, says Eurocontrol, an international organisation working to achieve safe and seamless air traffic management across Europe. \u201cAvoiding unexpected turbulence can lead to route extensions and increased fuel burn\/CO 2 emissions; so improving the capability to forecast turbulence means routes can be better planned and reduce additional track miles,\u201d a spokesperson for Eurocontrol tells The Independent. It is not only through air current disturbances that the climate crisis could impact passenger safety, scientists warn, but also with extreme weather events like storms and tropical cyclones \u2013 which are proven to be more common and more powerful due to global warming. To conserve fuel and time, airlines would want to fly the most direct route possible, covering the shortest distance between points. Deviations from this, known as Horizontal Flight Inefficiency (HFI), could increase significantly due to climate change, according to a recent Eurocontrol study . \u201cBy 2050, it is forecast that there will be a rise in HFI due to major storms of around 0.5 per cent, equivalent to 5,700 tonnes of CO 2 per year in the European region,\u201d the Eurocontrol spokesperson adds. As the seas get warmer, it is expected that there will be stronger cyclones and hurricanes, says Dr AchuthaRao, one of the contributing authors on the sixth IPCC panel report on climate change. \u201cWhen you have general global warming, warmer air can hold more moisture, so when it condenses, it is going to lead to more rainfall. So even routine rains may get heavier, and when you have larger rain amounts near coastal area airports, the drainage of water becomes an issue,\u201d the professor explains. The wrath of global heating will thus be endured not just by planes, but airports too. Storms near airports pose challenges to the efficiency of air travel: planes may need to remain in level flight for longer periods with implications for airline traffic, fuel burn and emissions. In addition to this, flight take-offs and landings will be increasingly affected by heat waves , especially at airports with short runways. New studies find surface air temperature has increased all over Asia over the last century, causing stronger, more frequent and longer heatwaves . \u201cFor every 3C rise in air temperature, air density reduces by 1 per cent which means the lift generated by aircrafts could also decrease by 1 per cent,\u201d Dr Williams explains. \u201cThis may not have a large impact on most aircraft much below their takeoff weight, but if the aircraft is heavy with lots of passengers, cargo and full of fuel, such warming can prevent it from taking off.\u201d A historical analysis of flights at 10 different airports in Greece has already found the maximum takeoff weight of the Airbus 320 and A320 has shrunk by about 4,000kg in the last three decades. \u201cSo four tonnes over the past 30 years due to increased temperature. This is already something that\u2019s happening,\u201d Dr Williams cautions. The University of Reading professor predicts more \u201ctake-off weight restrictions\u201d in the future, especially at airports with shorter runways. \u201cLonger runways allow for faster speeds and more lift so it\u2019s mainly a problem with short runways,\u201d he says. Flight schedules in Europe and other parts of the world warming at faster rates will likely be affected. Since runway expansions may not be feasible in most airports across populous parts of the world, Dr Williams says airports in many areas may start scheduling long-haul departures for early morning or late evening. They may move to this schedule \u2013 a common practice in regions like the Middle East where temperatures go up to 50C \u2013 or airlines may shift to lighter aircraft, he predicts. Recent calculations estimate about 12 per cent more lightning strikes across the globe for every 1C of global warming, suggesting more route deviations. \u201cWhile the aviation sector has long been referenced as contributing to the causes of climate change, the need for aviation to adapt to the consequences has not been as well researched,\u201d says Tim Ryley, Professor of Aviation at Griffith University in Australia. While there is \u201creasonable understanding\u201d of some effects of the climate crisis on aviation, like changes to storm patterns and sea level rise, predicting impacts on aircraft operations and surface winds \u201cwould benefit from more research,\u201d says the Eurocontrol spokesperson. Not just pilots and flight operators, cabin crew and airline hospitality teams must be trained to assist passengers when such sudden severe turbulence events hit, says Mr Doshi. \u201cTurbulence costs money: airport closures from water on runways cost money, canceling flights or bumping off passengers due to takeoff weight restrictions costs money, and lightning strikes cost money,\u201d Dr Williams concludes. \u201cUltimately, it will be passengers who will pay in terms of ticket price increases.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"New proposal could help combat rising sea levels, researchers say Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Refreezing the north and south poles could be a way to manage the climate crisis , scientists have suggested. In a new study led by Wake Smith at Yale University , researchers proposed that aerosol particles sprayed into the atmosphere from planes could reverse ice loss by partially blocking sunlight, cooling the ice poles as a result. Scientists believe this could help manage the issue of rising sea levels by slowing the melting of ice. The concept is called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and would cost \u00a310bn a year, but the researchers say it would cost less than other methods to tackle the climate crisis. Laid out in the Environmental Research Communications , the plan states roughly 175,000 flights a year would be needed to accomplish this, releasing tonnes of millions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But Mr Smith, who led the study, warned that the plan would only treat a symptom of the climate crisis and not the cause. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirin, not penicillin. It\u2019s not a substitute for decarbonisation,\u201d he said. Spraying aerosol particles into the atmosphere could reverse ice loss, researchers suggest The study is considered controversial because of the number of greenhouse gases that would be released into the atmosphere from the large number of flights carrying the microscopic aerosols. But the plan is backed by Sir David King, a former government chief scientist and founder of the Centre for Climate Repair (CCR) at Cambridge University, who told Sky News that the climate crisis was at a critical point and requires radical steps. \u201cThe idea is to buy time while we reduce greenhouse gas emissions deeply and rapidly,\u201d he said. The plan could help melting ice poles to refreeze \u201cThat\u2019s essential. If we keep on emitting at the current rate, we are cooked.\u201d Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, the CCR\u2019s director, also told Sky News that the significant number of flights made for the plan would be justified if the \u201curgent\u201d issue of rising sea levels could be managed as a result. The researchers also argued that only one per cent of the human population lives in the target deployment zone. \u201cIf the risk-benefit equation were to pay off anywhere, it would be at the poles,\u201d said Mr Smith. New proposal set to target the issue of rising sea levels \u201cAny intentional turning of the global thermostat would be of common interest to all of humanity.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":"Exclusive: Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s energy plans are \u2018completely at odds\u2019 with legal climate targets, government\u2019s ex chief scientific advisor has said Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Liz Truss\u2019s energy plans show the UK has effectively abandoned net-zero targets just three years after its world-leading commitment to cutting emissions , the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser has said. A major new fossil fuels campaign, including lifting the ban on fracking and expanding drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea, has already been announced by the new prime minister \u2019s administration. But the drive for more oil and gas production was \u201ccompletely at odds\u201d with the UK\u2019s legally binding net-zero target, said Sir David King , head of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, who was chief scientific adviser to the government between 2000 and 2007. Liz Truss and her new energy secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg Furthermore, it would bring large quantities of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels to the market directly ahead of the 2050 deadline for reaching zero, he told The Independent . He said the plans, announced last week by the prime minister\u2019s new energy secretary, Jacob-Rees Mogg, were \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a situation where the crisis is with us here today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t recognise that when we say \u2018let\u2019s go ahead and start new fracking operations in this country\u2019. \u201cIt beggars belief. What it seems to show is that the leadership in the government does not understand the nature of the climate crisis.\u201d Sir David King is the government\u2019s former chief scientific advisor Mr Rees-Mogg, who has previously dismissed climate science as \u201calarmism\u201d, said in a video on his second day in office that \u201cwe are lifting the moratorium on fracking. We will extract every ounce of oil and gas from the North Sea.\u201d During Ms Truss\u2019s leadership campaign, she derided the role that renewable energy increasingly plays in the energy system, in particular solar power, which has become the \u201ccheapest electricity in history\u201d, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). But Sir David, who is the founder and chair of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge , warned that the government\u2019s revival of fossil fuels could backfire rapidly. Activists from Extinction Rebellion stage an anti-fracking protest outside the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy He said: \u201cI fully agree with what the IEA is saying, which is \u2018do not invest in new oil and gas recovery\u2019. \u201cIf we do invest in new oil and gas recovery, it will take a minimum of five years to get to the marketplace and more like 10-15 years, which is the average. \u201cIn which case, they\u2019re not dealing with the current crisis at all, and instead are investing in an operation that is likely to become a stranded asset. \u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s a policy that hasn\u2019t been thought through in terms of climate change or in terms of the current climate crisis. It doesn\u2019t attack either [issue].\u201d Ms Truss wants to expand drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea His assessment of the government\u2019s position has been echoed by leading campaigning groups. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK\u2019s policy director, told The Independent : \u201cSir David King speaks the truth. Most sensible countries realise that the economically rational course is to drive rapidly for zero emissions, because it boosts the whole economy and tackles the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis in one fell swoop. \u201cTruss\u2019s current energy plans will do nothing for the economy any time soon, and will in fact create substantial stranded asset risks. \u201cFurther, they accelerate climate breakdown, contributing to the deadly heatwaves and floods we see around the world, and do nothing to impact the soaring costs of energy that will leave households and the national overdraft in trouble for years to come. \u201cIf Truss and Rees-Mogg continue on this course, it begs the question \u2013 whose interests are they serving?\u201d Sir David suggested the leadership of the country was using Russia \u2019s war in Ukraine as an opportunity to expand the use of fossil fuels \u2013 even though doing so failed to address either the climate crisis or the energy crisis. He said: \u201cThe immediate consequence of the Russia-Ukraine war is that energy prices have gone shooting up. The response to that [should be] to build more renewable energy \u2013 we can use an extension of an already successful operation. \u201cThe opposite is to say \u2018let\u2019s use this as an opportunity to develop our oil and gas reserves\u2019 \u2013 using the war as an opportunity to do this, knowing it has nothing to do with managing the short-term problems of the war. \u201cAll of that indicates massive cynicism at the top of government. What they\u2019re saying is \u2018we\u2019re not going to be in government in 2050, but we don\u2019t believe in the net-zero target\u2019.\u201d Friends of the Earth\u2019s head of policy, Mike Childs, told The Independent that Sir David was \u201cright to raise the alarm about the government\u2019s enthusiasm for fracking and drilling more gas and oil\u201d. He said: \u201cAt best, it\u2019s difficult to see how this enthusiasm for new fossil fuels is compatible with the prime minister\u2019s commitment to deliver on the UK\u2019s climate targets. \u201cAt worst, it\u2019s a sign that the new government is more interested in placating wealthy fossil fuel lobbyists than it is in tackling the mounting climate emergency and addressing the energy crisis for good.\u201d Energy experts have repeatedly called on the government to expand support for renewable energy technology and storage, implement a national insulation programme, invest in rolling out more heat pumps and halt investment in fossil fuel programmes. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy did not respond to The Independent \u2019s request for comment.

{"id":null,"body":"The hurricane had sustained winds of 155mph just hours before it is expected to make landfall in Florida Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Hurricane Ian is nearing Category 5 on Wednesday with Florida beginning to feel the impacts of an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d storm. The hurricane had sustained winds of 155mph just hours before it is expected to make landfall in Florida . After months with few notable storms, the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season is in full swing. As Florida hunkers down, Atlantic Canada is recovering from post-tropical cyclone Fiona which made landfall in Nova Scotia early on Saturday. As the world\u2019s average temperature increases and sea levels rise, hurricanes are expected to become stronger \u2014 and the damage more catastrophic, scientists say. Research on 2017\u2019s Hurricane Harvey in Texas found that planetary warming made rainfall during the days-long deluge 15 per cent more intense. Another study on 2019\u2019s Typhoon Hagbis in Japan found that the climate crisis added at least $4bn in additional damages. Sea-level rise is one way that the climate crisis is making these storms more dangerous. As the oceans rise, due to melting polar ice sheets and increased heat that expands water, coastal cities like Tokyo and New Orleans will be more likely to be inundated during storms. Since the 19th century, the global sea level has risen by about eight inches \u2013 threatening coastal communities and increasing the risk of flooding when storms push water inland. Rising sea levels can also wipe out natural defences that coastlines have against incoming hurricanes, such as wetlands of marshes and swamps that buffer storm surges and winds. One 2020 study found that in nearly 90 US tropical storms from 1996 to 2016, counties with more wetlands had less property damage. The authors of that study put a value on those wetlands \u2014 an average of $1.8m of damage protection per square kilometre per year. But as the seas rise, those wetlands \u2014 which sit at sea level \u2014 may start to disappear if they can\u2019t rebuild quickly enough to follow the receding shoreline. Another study looked at communities around Chesapeake Bay in the Northeast and found that in a climate scenario with a lot of sea level rise, losing wetlands could more than quadruple flooded areas from a storm and add more than $8bn in damage. Even without sea-level rise, hurricanes are expected to become destructive as the ocean heats up. Greenhouse gases, caused by burning fossil fuels, are trapping more heat near the Earth\u2019s surface. Scientists have calculated that about 90 per cent of the excess heat generated from emissions is being absorbed by the ocean. Since 1901, the top layer of the ocean has become about 1.5C hotter, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Warmer air and water fuel hurricane growth, powering intense winds and sending water into the clouds. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says that the climate crisis\u2019s impact on hurricane power is \u201clike adding fuel to a fire.\u201d Over the past four decades, the proportion of yearly cyclones that reach at least Category 3 in strength \u2014 meaning wind speed at least 111 mph (178 kph) \u2014 has increased, says the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading authority on global climate science. In addition to storm intensity, hurricanes often cause more damage if they linger over the coast, and this slowdown may also be a result of the climate crisis. One study found that, since 1949, hurricanes have slowed by 10 per cent \u2014 but there isn\u2019t scientific consensus on why. Hurricane Harvey was notoriously slow to dissipate, hanging around the Texas Gulf Coast for days and dropping upwards of 40 inches of rain in some spots. With such intense, sustained storms, flooding can be devastating. During Harvey, floods in the Houston area lasted for days, with thousands of homes damaged or destroyed and more than 100 people dead. There is one measure of hurricanes that may not be getting worse with the climate crisis. Despite recent years with an above-average number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, the IPCC says that there isn\u2019t a strong trend toward more tropical storms per year. According to Yale Climate Connections, some research indicates that there might even be slightly fewer hurricanes as the climate crisis worsens, due to changing wind patterns. Conditions vary from year to year. In 2022, for example, NOAA has predicted a higher-than-average Atlantic hurricane season partly due to warmer ocean waters and ongoing La Ni\u00f1a conditions. For the most part, scientists are telling the public to brace for harsher storms with more severe impacts. In the past four years, the world has faced down major crises like Hurricane Laura in Louisiana, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and Typhoon Mangkhut in the Phillippines \u2014 all of which caused intense destruction and significant loss of life. In 2017 alone, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria hit in the Atlantic, devastating Texas, the Caribbean and Puerto Rico. Cyclone Ockhi, which hit India and Sri Lanka that same year, killed over 900 people. As the world keeps warming, the era of climate-supercharged hurricanes is only likely to get worse.

{"id":null,"body":"Rapid formation of enormous tunnels below ice sheets in their \u2018death throes\u2019 should be considered for today\u2019s climate models, scientists say Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A glacial valley in Norway Below the North Sea , thousands of hidden giant valleys scoured out by retreating ice sheets 20,000 years ago are providing new insights into how the worsening climate crisis could impact our planet as it warms. New research into these valleys has found they could form in \"just hundreds of years\", allowing the transportation of enormous volumes of water, as the ice age ended. Today\u2019s sea level is around 130 metres higher than it was at the peak of the last ice age. Back then, Britain was a peninsula of mainland Europe, and large rivers such as the Rhine and the Thames were only tributaries to the river which eventually became the English Channel. As the ice receded, it unleashed huge volumes of water \u2013 sometimes unevenly , which reshaped the landscape. The new research shows the scale and the speed of a process of intense erosion beneath the ice sheets which is believed to have helped funnel melt water away from them, helping prevent a more rapid collapse. The scientists said these tunnel valleys, found beneath the modern seabed, can be up to 500 metres deep, 5km wide and 150km long \u2013 making each of them several times larger than Loch Ness. Lead author James Kirkham, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cThis is an exciting discovery. We know that these spectacular valleys are carved out during the death throes of ice sheets. \"By using a combination of state-of-the-art subsurface imaging techniques and a computer model, we have learnt that tunnel valleys can be eroded rapidly beneath ice sheets experiencing extreme warmth.\u201d These huge valleys were carved out beneath ice sheets in just a few hundred years, and helped divert meltwater to the ocean and away from the ice The team said they analysed \"jaw-droppingly detailed\" seismic images which provide a 3D scan of the Earth\u2019s buried layers. Informed by \"delicate clues\" discovered within the valleys, the authors performed a series of computer modelling experiments to simulate valley development, and test how quickly they formed as the last ice sheet to cover the UK melted away at the end of the most recent ice age about 20,000 years ago. The researchers said the \"surprisingly fast rate\" at which these tunnel valleys form means scientists must start considering their creation and effect on models used to understand how today\u2019s ice sheets may be impacted over the coming decades and centuries. \"There are no modern analogues for this rapid process\", the authors said, but these ancient valleys, now buried hundreds of metres beneath the muds of the North Sea seafloor, record a mechanism for how ice sheets respond to extreme warmth that is missing from present-day ice sheet models. The models do not currently resolve all water drainage processes, despite them appearing to be an important factor influencing future ice loss rates and ultimately sea level rise around the world. Mr Kirkham, a PhD student, said: \u201cThe pace at which these giant channels can form means that they are an important, yet currently ignored, mechanism that may potentially help to stabilise ice sheets in a warming world. \"As climate change continues to drive the retreat of the modern-day Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets at ever-increasing rates, our results call for renewed investigation of how tunnel valleys may help to stabilise contemporary ice losses, and therefore sea level rise, if they switch on beneath the Earth\u2019s ice sheets in the future.\u201d Dr Kelly Hogan, co-author and a geophysicist at BAS, said: \u201cWe have been observing these huge meltwater channels from areas covered by ice sheets in the past for more than a century but we did not really understand how they formed. \"Our results show, for the first time, that the most important mechanism is probably summer melting at the ice surface that makes its way to the bed through cracks or chimneys-like conduits and then flows under the pressure of the ice sheet to cut the channels. \"Surface melting is already hugely important for the Greenland Ice Sheet today, and this process of water transport through the system will only increase as our climate warms. The crucial question now is will this \u2018extra\u2019 meltwater flow in channels cause our ice sheets to flow more quickly, or more slowly, into the sea.\u201d The team said the research highlights an overlooked process that can rapidly switch on beneath melting ice sheets. Whether these channels will act to stabilise or destabilise the Earth\u2019s contemporary ice sheets in a warming world remains an important and open question. The research is published in the journal Quarternary Science Reviews .

{"id":null,"body":"Decision labelled \u2018a historic victory for climate justice\u2019 sparks hope in low-lying islands Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Dauan Island is among the Torres Strait islands suffering with rising sea levels Australia should compensate the islanders of the Torres Strait after violating their human rights by failing to take sufficient action on the climate crisis , the United Nations has said in a landmark ruling. In what marks the first-ever climate lawsuit brought against a nation state by inhabitants of low-lying islands, the claimants argued that rising sea levels had already damaged food sources and ancestral burial sites, scattering human remains, and had left homes at risk of being submerged. Three years after the complaint was filed, the UN\u2019s human rights committee ruled on Friday that the Australian government\u2019s failure to adequately protect the Indigenous islanders from climate breakdown represented a violation of their rights to family life and to culture. The lawsuit \u2013 by eight Australian nationals and six of their children inhabiting the islands of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig \u2013 alleged that former premier Scott Morrison \u2019s government had violated their rights by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and upgrade seawall protections, among other failures. However, the body of 18 legal experts in Geneva ruled that the Canberra government had not committed one of the three alleged violations, that of the right to life, as enshrined in article six of the UN\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, agreed in 1966. The covenant has been ratified by 173 of the UN\u2019s 193 member states, including Australia. While there is no enforcement mechanism, there are follow-up steps, and states generally comply with the UN committee\u2019s findings. The ruling represents the first time a nation state has been found responsible for its greenhouse gas emissions under international human rights law, and the first time that Indigenous people\u2019s right to culture has been found to be at risk from climate impacts. As the first among a wave of similar lawsuits, the UN\u2019s decision could pave the way for similar judgments to be passed on other nations \u2013 and embolden other would-be claimants. Committee member Helene Tigroudja said: \u201cThis decision marks a significant development because the committee has created a pathway for individuals to assert claims where national systems have failed to take appropriate measures to protect those most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on the enjoyment of their human rights.\u201d The UN committee has asked that Australia compensate the islanders for the harm suffered and to take whatever steps necessary to secure the communities\u2019 safe existence. Australia\u2019s attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, stressed that the case predated the current administration, telling Reuters that Anthony Albanese \u2019s new Labour government was working with the islanders on climate change \u201cThe Australian government engages in good faith with the human rights committee in relation to any complaint received,\u201d Mr Dreyfus said, adding that Canberra was \u201cconsidering the committee\u2019s views and will provide its response in due course\u201d. The case was filed in 2019, when the former conservative government led by Mr Morrison, seen as a laggard in the battle against climate breakdown, was in power. Since then, Canberra has passed legislation on emissions cuts. While Mr Morrison refused an invitation to visit climate-stricken islanders in 2019, Mr Albanese and climate minister Chris Bowen travelled shortly after their election for climate talks on the islands, which are mostly part of Queensland and are situated in the sea passage between Australia and Papua New Guinea. In their complaint, the islanders alleged that changes in weather patterns had had direct harmful consequences on their livelihood, culture and traditional way of life, with severe flooding caused by tidal surges having destroyed family graves and scattered human remains. Maintaining ancestral graveyards and communicating with deceased relatives are at the heart of their cultures, they argued and the committee took into account the islanders\u2019 close, spiritual connection with their traditional lands and the dependence of their cultural integrity on the health of their surrounding ecosystems. Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous allies occupy the foyer of Canberra\u2019s Parliament House in February 2019 The claimants also argued that increased heavy rainfall and storms had degraded their islands\u2019 land and trees, reducing the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming. On Masig Island, for example, rising sea levels have caused saltwater to seep into the soil and coconut trees to become diseased, killing off the fruit, which are part of the islanders\u2019 traditional diet. One of the claimaints said that the islanders\u2019 ancestors would be \u201crejoicing\u201d over the legal victory, which offered a glimpse of hope in the existential battle ahead. \u201cThis morning, when I woke up on Masig, I saw that the sky was full of frigate birds. In my culture, we take this as a sign from my ancestors that we would be hearing good news very soon about this case,\u201d said claimant Yessie Mosby, a Kulkalgal man and traditional owner on the island of Masig. \u201cI know that our ancestors are rejoicing knowing that Torres Strait islander voices are being heard throughout the world through this landmark case. Climate change affects our way of life every day. \u201cThis win gives us hope that we can protect our island homes, culture and traditions for our kids and future generations to come.\u201d A lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, Sophie Marjanac, who has been supporting the claimants, called the ruling a \u201chistoric victory for climate justice\u201d. \u201cIt is a victory for all peoples who are the most vulnerable to runaway climate change and opens the door to further legal action and compensation claims in international and domestic law,\u201d Ms Marjanac said, urging the Australian government to \u201cact on this decision and take decisive steps to protect the islands\u201d. \u201cAnything less will be both illegal and a huge moral failing,\u201d she added.

{"id":null,"body":"The president traveled to Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast where some communities were obliterated by the near Category-5 storm Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile President Joe Biden has said that Hurricane Ian \u2013 and other extreme events like wildfires and droughts \u2013 has ended the discussion \u201cabout whether or not there\u2019s climate change and we should do something about it\u201d. The president made the remarks after travelling to Florida \u2019s Gulf Coast on Wednesday with First Lady Dr Jill Biden where they visited some of the worst-impacted communities. The Bidens were greeted warmly by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey at Fort Myers Beach, a town on the Gulf Coast, which has been largely obliterated by the near Category-5 storm. Mr Biden and Mr DeSantis spoke at length, in a rare show of bipartisanship for two men who have attacked each other publicly over hot-button political issues including immigration and vaccine mandates. After meeting with local people who had lost homes and businesses, the Florida governor spoke first, thanking President Biden for his support. The president followed and opened by saying that he had \u201cbeen to a lot of disaster areas in the last six months\u201d. He referenced large wildfires in the West and Southwest that have burned more to the ground than \u201cthe entire state of New Jersey\u201d. \u201cThe reservoirs out west are down to almost zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where the Colorado River looks more like a stream.\u201d As Governor DeSantis looked on, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on and I think the one thing that this has finally ended is the discussion about whether or not there\u2019s climate change and we should do something about it.\u201d Mr DeSantis has repeatedly voted against legislation that would cut greenhouse gas emissions even while he has announced hundreds of millions of dollars to help his state with the impacts of increasingly powerful hurricanes and rising sea levels. In January 2013, the newly elected Congressman DeSantis opposed a $9.7bn flood insurance aid package to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey. He said the victims had his sympathy, but that sending them the federal funds was not \u2018fiscally responsible\u2019. The climate crisis does not necessarily mean more hurricanes in the future \u2013 but planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions, largely caused by burning fossil fuels, are super-charging storms making it more common for them to rapidly-intensify and hold more water. Hurricane Ian is one of the strongest in Florida\u2019s history, slamming into state last Wednesday with 155mph winds, heavy rain, and a powerful storm surge which overwhelmed communities. The hurricane then ploughed across the state, dropping several feet of rain in cities hundreds of miles inland. At least 100 people have been killed in Florida. Over half of the deaths were in Lee County, where multiple neighbourhoods were wiped out by the impacts. More than 3,000 people have been rescued after search teams knocked on 70,000 doors. Early estimates put Hurricane Ian\u2019s damage between $28bn to $47bn. Thousands are now homeless \u2013 with a significant number lacking insurance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) is preparing for potentially thousands of people to be long-term displaced. While power has been stored for more than 2.5 million customers in Florida since peak outages, over 297,00 people remain without power in the state, according to poweroutage.us . On Wednesday, Mr Biden spoke directly to Floridians. He said that he had visited to tell them in person \u201cwe\u2019re not leaving until this gets done\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to take years for everything to get squared away in the state of Florida... to fully rebuild and recover,\u201d he added. During the trip, the President and First Lady surveyed storm-ravaged areas from a helicopter en route to Fishermans Wharf area of Fort Myers Beach. They went on to speak with small business owners and local residents along with first responders and local officials who have been working around the clock in the aftermath of the hurricane. President Biden issued a major disaster declaration for Florida in the wake of Hurricane Ian that provided individual assistance and debris removal for 17 counties, and the Indigenous Seminole Tribe of Florida, along with for costs associated with search and rescue, sheltering, feeding, and other emergency measures to save lives for 30 days. Ahead of his visit he made additional federal funding available to Florida for another 30 days of assistance. Meterologists warn that more hurricanes are undergoing a process called \u201crapid intensification\u201d where they build in strength over short periods of time, and can catch regions by surprise when they make landfall. The National Hurricane Center defines \u201crapid intensification\u201d as an increase in wind strength of at least 30 knots, or about 34 mph, in 24 hours. Analysis, published by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last week, also found that human-induced climate change increased Ian\u2019s extreme rain rates by more than 10 per cent, the nonprofit Climate Signals reported .

{"id":null,"body":"While more people are waking up to the reality of climate crisis, vested interests are proliferating misinformation. Can the truth gap be bridged? Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile It\u2019s tempting to write off climate deniers as scientifically-illiterate cranks when evidence overwhelmingly shows that the\u00a0 climate crisis is caused by human behaviour , largely the burning of fossil fuels. But climate misinformation is insidious, proliferating across social media and some news sites. How many of us can honestly say we\u2019ve never been taken in by a lie? A report by the advocacy group Stop Funding Heat found that climate misinformation gets viewed up to 1.36 million times every day on Facebook alone, though it\u2019s been found on all social platforms, from TikTok to Pinterest. So assume that it\u2019s slipping through the cracks onto your feeds too. Fossil fuel companies, other major polluters, and their allies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to spread climate misinformation on social media. One 2021 analysis found that 16 of the world's biggest polluters were responsible for placing more than 1,700 of these ads on Facebook in 2021, generating roughly 150 million impressions. Climate propaganda can also provide false comfort to those struggling with the enormity of the threat so it\u2019s understandable that people would want to bury their head in the sand as a coping mechanism. Below are some of the most common climate lies - and how to respond. Geological records show that there have been large shifts in the earth\u2019s climate over millennia, caused by factors including volcanic eruptions, variations in the earth\u2019s orbit, and shifting levels of carbon dioxide. However, there is a stark difference between an anthropogenic, or man-made, climate crisis and ancient climate changes which have occurred very slowly, over thousands or millions of years. The current climate crisis is being driven by human actions, largely the burning of fossil fuels, and has happened in a dramatically shorter period of time. Science shows that the average global temperature has risen about 1.1-1.2C over the past 150 years, since industrial times began. A common refrain from fossil fuel lobbyists is that renewables are too expensive. However, globally, renewables are significantly undercutting coal, oil and gas as the world\u2019s cheapest source of power, says the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an intergovernmental organisation that supports the transition to sustainable energy. \u201cAlmost two-thirds of newly-installed renewable power in 2021 had lower costs than the world\u2019s cheapest coal-fired option in the G20,\u201d IRENA\u2019s report stated. Costs of clean energy have plummeted due to technological advances across many of the components. A new type of battery for energy storage is six times cheaper than conventional lithium-ion batteries , for example. And as more communities adopt renewables, the economies of scale drive costs down even further. A disputed report , covered by The Australian newspaper, has claimed that electric vehicles (EVs) produce more carbon emissions than those fuelled by gasoline. It is true that charging up EVs still relies on large-scale grids which are heavily reliant on fossil fuels in many countries. However, a study by the universities of Exeter and Cambridge and Nijmegen in the Netherlands concluded that electric cars lead to lower carbon emissions overall, even if the electric power still relies on fossil fuels . A separate analysis by Transport & Environment (T&E), a European umbrella for non-governmental organisations in the field of transport and the environment, found that fossil fuel-powered cars waste hundreds of times more raw materials over their lifetime than their electric counterparts. In July Right-wing commentator and Daily Wire columnist Matt Walsh tweeted: \u201cRemember when they spent years telling us to panic over the hole in the ozone layer and then suddenly just stopped talking about it and nobody ever mentioned the ozone layer again?\u201d Twitter being Twitter, it was quickly pointed out that the ozone layer, a protective shield in the earth\u2019s stratosphere which absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun, was saved by unified environmental international action. In the past, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, solvents, and refrigerants. But they caused such catastrophic damage to the ozone layer that an international treaty, called the Montreal Protocol, was adopted to ban them in 1987. In short, it worked: the\u00a0 ozone layer \u00a0is continuing to heal and has the potential to fully recover , scientists have confirmed. The US Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested that solar and wind energy don\u2019t work at night, prompting online mockery. She said: \u201cLord please God don\u2019t make me scrub clothes in a bucket and have to hang them out on a line when we switch over to wind turbines and solar panels. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be really pissed off about that. I mean, how absurd is this? I like the lights on. I wanna stay up later at night. I don\u2019t wanna have to go to bed when the sun sets. It\u2019s so silly! I mean, all of this is insane.\u201d Solar and wind power can be intermittent but so is all energy production. Fossil fuel power stations are out of action more than you think. Energy expert Amory Lovins estimates that the average coal plant is unavailable to supply power about 15% of the time, while the average nuclear plant and gas plant are unavailable about 9% and 5% of the time, respectively. But solar and wind power can be restored in batteries - and as noted above, the cost of battery technology is dropping while the capacity increases. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are devices, usually lithium-ion batteries, that enable energy from renewables, like solar and wind, to be stored and then released when customers need power most. A mix of renewable energy sources, including tidal, geothermal, and biomass, will also maintain power levels, as can linking energy grids between different countries. Former US president Donald Trump has amplified this lie on social media - one of his many zingers of climate denial including that \u201cclimate change is a hoax invented by China\u201d and \u201cwind turbines cause cancer\u201d. He said: \u201cIf you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 per cent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer, you tell me that one, okay?\u201d The climate crisis and weather are not the same - cold snaps and winter seasons are still happening in places all over the world. However, it is the rise in the average global temperature that is driving extreme and devastating climate impacts such as flooding, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and more. In fact, there is evidence that global heating at higher latitudes is forcing the polar jet stream to dip farther south, causing more intense bouts of winter weather . Since the 1980s, each decade has been hotter than the last. The warmest seven years have all been since 2015, with 2016, 2019 and 2020 in the top three, according to the Met Office.

{"id":null,"body":" As the climate crisis grows, meteorologists, scientists and journalists alike are increasingly reporting on its impact on everyday life. But its not without risks, reports senior climate correspondent Louise Boyle Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile KCCI Chief Meteorologist Chris Gloninger received a death threat after speaking about climate change on-air C hris Gloninger was at the barber\u2019s shop when the death threat arrived. After 17 years in television, the chief meteorologist for KCCI in Des Moines , Iowa, had grown a thick skin. But this was different. The emails started in June and were filled with anger over Gloninger\u2019s weather forecasts . The forecasts routinely incorporated facts on climate change , a practice that he hoped would help viewers connect the dots between the global threat of a hotter planet and more extreme heatwaves , drought, and flash flooding at the local level. \u201cI think you can turn people off if you\u2019re hitting them over the head with [climate change],\u201d Gloninger told The Independent last month. \u201cI don\u2019t grasp at straws. I try to find connections that are meaningful and have an impact on viewers.\u201d The first email accused him of \u201cliberal conspiracy theory on the weather\u201d, adding that \u201cclimate changes every day, always has, always will, your [ sic ] pushing nothing but a Biden hoax, go back to where you came from\u201d. Gloninger, who grew up in Sag Harbor, New York, replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not politics, it\u2019s science, and it\u2019s supported by the vast majority of climate and atmospheric scientists. Thank you for watching.\u201d A few days later, another email dropped into his inbox. \u201cWhat\u2019s your address, we conservative Iowans would like to give you an Iowan welcome you will never forget, kinda like the libtards gave JUDGE KAVANAUGH!!!!!!!\u201d the message raged. The threat appeared to reference the news that a man had been charged with attempted murder after going to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s home with a gun, knife, hammer, zip ties and other weapons. \u201cI was getting my hair cut and the email popped up and I just got this sinking feeling,\u201d Gloninger said. \u201cMy wife was home, I was away, and I thought, I have to get home. I decided to call the police because it was more than just a mean email, it was a direct threat. Then it turned into an obsession.\u201d Gloninger became interested in weather as a child after Hurricane Bob hit his hometown in 1991, going on to graduate in meteorology from Plymouth State University and become a certified broadcast meteorologist with the American Meteorological Society. Before landing the chief role in Des Moines, Gloninger worked at TV stations in Wisconsin, Michigan and Massachusetts. At NBC10 in Boston, he started the first weekly series on climate change, and reported on hurricanes, EF4 tornadoes, major flooding and ice floes. Still, the email harrassment left him shaken, he said, fearing for his safety and his wife who was home alone when he worked late shifts at the TV station. \u201cI\u2019ve never had mental health issues before,\u201d Gloninger said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary because there was a time, and there are still times, that I\u2019m not okay after it.\u201d Following the death threat, KCCI\u2019s parent company, Hearst, paid for the Gloningers to stay in a hotel while a security system was installed at their home. Security was also bolstered at the TV station, and at his public events. \u201cI\u2019m blessed from that standpoint in this industry, especially [because] we don\u2019t get that compassion as much anymore,\u201d Gloninger said. The harrassing emails continued for weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t watch your worthless weather forecast because your [ sic ] an idiot but someone else texted me and said you are still an idiot, go the hell back where you came from D********!!!\u201d one read. On 15 July, an email referred to Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has led the US Covid-19 response. It told Gloninger to \u201cgo east and drown from the ice cap melting you dumbf***!!!!!!!\u201d Somewhat to his surprise, Gloninger said, police in Des Moines took the death threat and the harassment seriously. The digital crime detective took charge of the case and subpoenaed Google for phone data. KCCI Chief Meteorologist Chris Gloninger explains the correlation between carbon emissions and global temperature rise during a broadcast Danny H Hancock, 63, of Lenox, Iowa, was later fined $150 for sending the emails. Gloninger\u2019s experience appears to have been rare among colleagues. \u201cWhen I connected with other meteorologists doing similar work, no one has ever experienced anything that dramatic,\u201d Gloninger said. Climate Central , a nonprofit which assists meteorologists with research and provides visual tools like graphics and maps, reported that the vast majority of meteorologists who have integrated climate science into their weathercasts have received less pushback than expected - even in very conservative areas. However Gloninger\u2019s experience also underlines a rise in online harrassment more broadly of those who talk and write about the climate crisis . The issue has become so dizzyingly politicized that even speaking the words can trigger a backlash. \u201cIf you hear that your colleagues are getting harassed for putting information on social media or in media outlets, that has to have some sort of chilling effect on scientists,\u201d Dr Jacob Carter, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Independent. Overall, one-third of US-based journalists report being harassed on social media, according to polling by the Pew Research Center, with threats of physical harm the most common. Journalists\u2019 gender, race, and\/or sexual orientation play a role in how much harrassment they experience. A quarter of both Black and Asian journalists (27 per cent) say they have experienced threats or harassment based on race or ethnicity, as do 20 per cent of Hispanic journalists, according to Pew. About one-in-six journalists who are women (16 per cent) say they have been sexually harassed by someone outside their organization, versus 3 per cent of men. Science reporters, including those who write climate change, also appear to attract particular ire, according to a survey from journalism professors at George Washington University . Joan Meiners, a journalist with the Arizona Republic , referenced the data in a recent article about the hatemail she has been sent on her climate reporting. Her interviews with colleagues around the country discovered many similar experiences. For climate scientists, academics, and activists, some of whom have spent decades warning about oncoming devastating impacts even while the media was slow to catch up, speaking out has not been without risks. More than 1,700 people around the world have been killed for defending the environment in the past decade, a recent Global Witness report revealed . Few scientists understand the threat better than Dr Michael Mann, a presidential distinguished professor of earth and environmental science, and director at the Penn Center for Science Sustainability and the Media, who regularly appears on TV to talk about climate change and has written dozens of articles. Such is his public profile that last year he was name-checked by Leonardo DiCaprio as his inspiration for the scientist he played in the movie, Don\u2019t Look Up. In the late Nineties, Dr Mann became the target of a vicious hate campaign after his research discovered that the sharp uptick in global temperatures over the past 150 years was unprecedented in at least 1,000 years and coincided to when humans began burning fossil fuels with abandon. More than 99.9 per cent of peer-reviewed scientific papers now show that climate change is mainly caused by humans. In the wake of his study, Dr Mann\u2019s emails were stolen and manipulated. He received thousands of abusive emails and death threats , and an envelope of powder was sent to his home, triggering an FBI response (it turned out to be corn starch). Ken Cuccinelli, a former Republican attorney general, called for his academic credentials to be removed. ( Dr Mann later wrote a book about his experiences ). \u201cI considered retreating into the lab, shunning the attention,\u201d Dr Mann told The Independent, in an email this week. \u201cBut it just wasn\u2019t in my constitution. I was always a fighter. I would fight back against bullies twice my size in grade school, because it was the right thing to do. \u201cAnd the fossil fuel industry and their henchmen\u2014they\u2019re the biggest bully on the planet. I knew I had to fight back, because the stakes were too great. It was just about defending my name and my research. It was about the greatest battle we face as a civilization. I feel privileged to have ultimately had an opportunity to participate in the effort to inform the public and policymakers about this defining challenge.\u201d He concluded: \u201cYou fight the good fight. Because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d While social networks and conservative media have played a sizeable role, the arteries of climate misinformation flow from the fossil fuel industry, which has known for nearly half a century that greenhouse gas emissions from oil, gas and coal use are heating the planet. Fossil fuel companies have denied any campaign to mislead Americans, despite a publicly-available wealth of documents and statements to the contrary. The industry\u2019s long-running misinformation campaign was the subject of Congressional investigation last year and has led to at least 20 lawsuits filed by US cities and states. The deceptive tactics have taken a toll on the US public\u2019s understanding of the climate crisis -- even as more communities face extreme heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and hurricanes. While there is growing concern among Americans about the climate crisis overall, data shows, the political divide has deepened in the last 20 years. Gallup polling in 2021 found that 32 per cent of Republicans attribute the rise in Earth\u2019s temperatures over the past century to human activity, a drop from 52 per cent in the early 2000s. The percentage of Democrats who say humans have caused climate change has risen from 68 to 88 per cent over the same period. It\u2019s that divide that Gloninger said factored into his decision to take a chief meteorologist job in conservative-leaning Iowa, where talking about climate change could have deeper impact than \u201cpreaching to the choir\u201d in more liberal Boston. Climate change is personal, he pointed out, no matter where you\u2019re from. Where Gloninger grew up on eastern Long Island, there was once a booming commercial fishing industry. As the ocean has warmed, that industry moved up to Maine and is shifting further north still, to Nova Scotia. His hometown of Sag Harbor transformed into a weekend destination for well-heeled New Yorkers. \u201cIt survived but in other parts of the country, they don\u2019t always have that luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people need to understand that [climate change] is not a future problem, that we\u2019re starting to see these changes, with agriculture in Iowa, for example. These things make it real to people. How does it affect them? Why should they care?\u201d Gloninger debated at length with his wife on whether to speak publicly about the harrassment and death threat, and still worries about retaliation. \u201cI was so torn because what they\u2019re doing the media and to science is scary and on the verge of being dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I fear that if you let it go, that emboldens a certain part of the population that think it\u2019s okay to be filled with hate, anger, and think that threats are fine to make. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tide change in the coverage of climate change, it\u2019s becoming more mainstream but we\u2019re still getting pushback. If people don\u2019t realize that, then they\u2019re not getting the accurate picture of climate communications.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Addressing climate change \u2014 a now ubiquitous term for the warming of the planet caused by humans emitting carbon dioxide and methane from coal, oil and natural gas into the atmosphere \u2014 is becoming exponentially more pressing, with the language of scientists, officials and activists becoming more serious with every passing year. The most recent report by the world\u2019s top body of climate scientists gave a damning assessment of where the world is headed if more isn't done to curb global warming. Already, more extreme weather events are happening across the globe, from longer, more intense and more frequent droughts and heat waves to devastating floods and wetter hurricanes, attributed at least in part to climate change. How the planet got here, the current and future effects of climate change, and what to do next, are all questions that experts have been researching for decades. ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. ___ There may be an uptick in climate-related policy, discussions and activism, but the science isn't all that new. Scientists in the early 1800s began to recognize that some gasses and water vapor could trap heat in the atmosphere. And for the last sixty years, researchers could definitively measure that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were rising, thanks to a CO2-monitoring station at Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Meteorologists in the middle of the twentieth century also started to understand the climate as a \u201csystem that is dynamic, constantly changing, and perhaps also vulnerable to external forcing and alteration,\u201d said Martin Mahony, a lecturer of human geography at the University of East Anglia who studies the history of climate science and its interactions with politics. Add to that the knowledge that CO2 levels were going up and scientists started realizing that this could be a major issue. \u201cIn the 1960s, you start getting conferences and workshops on \u2018the CO2 problem\u2019 ... bringing meteorologists together with the geophysicists and other folks to think through the implications of this in very abstract, theoretical terms,\u201d Mahony said. But it wasn't long before this theoretical puzzle became a serious concern. By the late eighties, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up to assess how much the climate is warming and if humans have anything to do with it. Ever since its first report in 1990, the link between fossil fuels and global warming was clear. Coal, oil and natural gas for electricity, heating, transport, industries like steel and cement-making, and the gasses from agriculture and refrigerants, are burning up the planet. Scientists say that average global temperatures have gone up by around 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the middle of the nineteenth century, causing hotter temperature extremes, rising seas and weather disasters, with experts warning that more catastrophic climate events are on the way as the world warms up further. \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to be heatwaves, drought, wildfires and hurricanes. It\u2019s going to be water resources, it\u2019s going to be food supplies ... it\u2019s going to be national security concerns that are going to be more apparent than they are right now,\u201d said Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb. Those living in the least developed nations or in poorer communities are often the most vulnerable to climate change. Many have called for rich, high-polluting countries, like the U.S. and much of Europe, to pay their share so that developing countries are more resilient to weather extremes and can curb their use of fossil fuels. Known as \u201closs and damage\u201d in climate negotiations, it's an area that nations have struggled to agree on in recent years. In a somewhat rare moment of agreement between rich nations and more climate-vulnerable, low-emitting ones, countries at the U.N.'s annual climate conference in Paris in 2015 did agree to limit warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, with the aim of capping the average global temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Alternatives to fossil fuels, like solar and wind energy, need to be scaled up dramatically if the Paris climate goals are to be met, experts say. Newer technologies, like carbon capture or green hydrogen, which are currently too expensive, untested at scale or both, will also have to be deployed to limit warming. Changes in people's personal lives can also make a difference, although the large reductions come from government policies and choices made by giant corporations, rather than individuals. Although some effects of global warming are locked in, many scientists believe that curbing warming to just a few more tenths of a degree is achievable, but only if drastic action is taken very quickly. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

{"id":null,"body":" \u2018Catastrophic ecological threats\u2019 amplified by environmental destruction causing water scarcity and food insecurity Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A ship passes an oil spill near an oil depot in Lagos, Nigeria. The country is among those facing the worst ecological threats Around 768 million people across 27 countries around the world are at the increasing risk posed by catastrophic ecological threats as the climate crisis worsens, a major international study has warned. Climate-related threats, such as water scarcity , food stress, and natural disasters mean that in 2021 the number of undernourished people around the world rose to 750 million, a rise of 35 per cent since 2017, according to the latest Ecological Threat Report from global think tank the Institute for Economics and Peace. The report\u2019s authors said their findings prove that \"existing ecological challenges will only be amplified by climate change\", and current approaches to tackling the climate crisis are failing millions of the most vulnerable people. The report analyses ecological risk, societal resilience, and peace for 228 countries and territories around the world. In its latest report it identifies 27 countries home to an estimated 768 million people, which face the worst ecological threats and have the lowest societal resilience. 23 of the 27 are in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. The report also warned that almost 92 per cent of the world\u2019s undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries. Undernourishment, which the analysts defined as being \"where a person\u2019s habitual food consumption is medically insufficient to sustain them\", is forecast to deteriorate even further due to the rising rate of ecological degradation around the world, as well as rising inflation, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite the climate crisis significantly increasing all risks, the report said due to more immediate threats to life, concern about the climate emergency was lower in 2021 than in 2019. \"Regions exposed to the highest levels of ecological threat are on average the least concerned with climate change, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia ranking war, terrorism, crime, violence and livelihoods as of greater concern,\" the research team said. Steve Killelea, the founder and executive chairman of the IEP, called on governments around the world to focus on long-term solutions to address the degradation of the natural world, and to\u00a0 end wars and the forced migration which conflicts cause. He said: \u201cAs we approach COP27, this report is a timely reminder that the costs of many of the existing ecological challenges will only be amplified by climate change. \"The world\u2019s current approach to the countries suffering the worst climate-related issues is not working \u2013 ecological threats are increasing and have systemic causes that require systemic solutions.\" He added: \"Governments and international agencies must invest in building long-term resilience to avert future ecological destruction, forced migration and conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war highlights the effects of conflict on forced migration, with 12 \u2013 14 million Ukrainians currently displaced in neighbouring countries. Developmental programmes should focus on micro enterprises which capture water, improve agriculture and on value-added manufacturing. This will improve the lives of the people who are suffering the most.\u201d The report warned that continuing business as usual was taking an enormous toll on people and the planet. Air pollution costs the world $8.1 trillion annually \u2013 around 6 per cent of global GDP, and claiming between 6-9 million lives. Nine cities have over 20 times the maximum level of air pollution recommended by WHO, including Lahore, Kabul and Agra. Meanwhile, the 40 countries identified as being rated the lowest for peace are projected to increase their population by 1.3 billion, making up 49 per cent of the world\u2019s population by 2050. The countries facing the worst ecological threats will see the biggest increases, with sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population projected to increase by 95 per cent by the middle of the century.

{"id":null,"body":" Human-induced climate change is the \u201cmost pervasive threat\u201d to the world, says top UN expert Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Wind turbines seen from the beach at Crosby, Merseyside, England Human rights are being \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d and \u201cviolated\u201d due to the consequences of climate change , a top UN expert has said. Ian Fry, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, said that this includes the right to life, health, food, development, self-determination, water and sanitation, work, adequate housing and freedom from violence, sexual exploitation, trafficking and slavery. In a report presented to the UN\u2019s General Assembly on Friday, Mr Fry said that human-induced climate change is the \u201cmost pervasive threat\u201d to the world and the poorest societies are paying the heaviest price. He said: \u201cThere is an enormous injustice being manifested by developed economies against the poorest and least able to cope. Inaction by developed economies and major corporations to take responsibility for drastically reducing their greenhouse gas emissions has led to demands for \u2018climate reparations\u2019 for losses incurred. \u201cThe G20 members for instance, account for 78 per cent of emissions over the last decade.\u201d Fry said that actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were \u201cinadequate\u201d and creating a \u201chuman rights catastrophe\u201d. The UN expert also raised concerns about climate rights defenders, and in particular indigenous peoples, who have been the target of human rights abuses. He added: \u201cAs groups and communities become increasingly frustrated with the lack of action on climate change, they have turned to protests and public interventions to bear witnesses to the climate emergency. \u201cSadly, we are seeing many climate rights defenders persecuted by governments and security organisations. Some defenders have even been killed.\u201d Fry said the those most affected by climate change and suffering \u201cthe greatest losses\u201d are not being involved enough in decision-making and he urged policymakers to involve \u201cchildren and youth, women, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and minorities.\u201d \u201cThe overall effect of inadequate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is creating a human rights catastrophe, and the costs of these climate change related disasters are enormous,\u201d Mr Fry said. In August, the United Nations Human Rights Council recognised the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right. And just last month, the Council of Europe urged its 46 member states to also recognise a sustainable environment as a human right.

{"id":null,"body":" As Egypt gets read to host UN climate summit, the worsening impact of warming is clearly visible in the Nile Delta region Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Related: People in power \u2018do not prioritise\u2019 climate crisis, says Greta Thunberg Sayed Abuel-Ezz has seen his crops wither from seawater before. As the Nile Delta farmer walks among his mango trees on his land not far from the Mediterranean Sea , he worries it will happen again despite spending the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars to prevent it. \u201cIf it gets higher, the trees will die,\u201d Abuel-Ezz said, looking towards the sea. Here, the impact of climate change has long been obvious to farmers, in the creeping salt that eats away roots and cakes their fields, turning them barren. They pay a fortune to bring in truckloads of earth to try to raise their crops above the salt pushed into the soil by rising sea levels. But they say it is getting worse. Bus drivers can see the changes too, how the sea more and more easily spills over onto the land. Now every winter, parts of the vital international highway running the length of Egypt \u2019s coast are flooded, say drivers on the route. The Delta covers roughly 240 square kilometres, starting just north of the capital of Cairo where the Nile River fans out. The rivers\u2019 branches created rich, fertile land by depositing silt as they made their way to the sea. Since ancient times, the area has been the food basket of empires. It\u2019s heavily populated, home to some 40 per cent of Egypt\u2019s 104 million people and accounts for half of the country\u2019s economy, according to the UN food agency. Farms and fisheries along the two Nile branches, Rosetta in the west and Damietta in the east, help feed the country and provide products for export. All of that is increasingly threatened by climate change and rising seas. A quarter of the Delta sits at or below sea level. An increase between 0.5 and 1 meter (1.6 to 3.2 feet) \u2014 which could happen by 2100 in one of the UN-backed panel's worst-case scenarios \u2014 will shift the coastline inward by several kilometres, submerging large areas and rendering it more barren with salt. That\u2019s according to a recent report by an international group of scientists overseen by the Cyprus Institute\u2019s Climate and Atmosphere Research Center and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. A farmer closes the water valve of a pump in Kafr al-Dawar village in northern Egypt\u2019s Nile Delta \u201cThis would imply severe challenges for coastal infrastructure and agriculture, and can lead to the salinisation of coastal aquifers, including the densely populated and cultivated Nile Delta,\u201d said George Zittis, who co-authored the report. The scenario judged to be more likely by the panel is that the sea will rise by 0.3-0.6 meters by 2100. That will still render thousands of acres unfit for farming or habitation. Spanning several generations, the farmers and other residents said they have sensed climate change\u2019s effects for years, particularly in rising sea levels. They have seen greater shore erosion and groundwater contaminated by salt. The saltwater intrudes as pressure grows from rising seawater, and the counter-pressure from freshwater has lessened. Saltwater intrusion is the most challenging threat to the Delta, said Mohamed Abdel Monem, a senior adviser on land and climate change with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. \u201cThis means less productivity and in many cases crops\u2019 death and therefore food insecurity,\u201d he said. Hamdy Salah, a 26-year-old farmer outside the town of Rosetta in the western Delta, says planting practices have changed drastically. They once grew a variety: tomatoes, eggplants, pumpkins, and other vegetables. Now they grow mostly mango and citrus, which are less vulnerable to salt. \u201cWe tried other crops like apple, but saltwater also killed its roots,\u201d he said. Abuel-Ezz\u2019s family have farmed in Rosetta for generations, and he and his two brothers cultivate two farms of mango and citrus, five acres each. A decade ago, they elevated their farmlands, one field by 1 meter (3.3 feet) and the second by 2 meters (6.6 feet), to combat rising saline water in the body of their farms. It cost them around 2 million pounds (\u00a388,481) by today's prices, said Sayed\u2019s brother, Saber Abuel-Ezz. The elevation, along with a government-built runoff system meant to reduce salt in the soil, bought them some time. \u201cIt was costly but there was no alternative,\u201d said Sayed, a 36-year-old father of two. Besides bringing in tons of earth, many cultivate plants in raised beds and use whatever natural or chemical fertilizers they can afford to counteract the saline. Without these measures, the land quickly turns desolate. On the other side of the river from Rosetta town, sheets of dried salt cover former farmland outside the town of Mutubas. On one September afternoon, a half-dozen farmers sat near a machine pumping water from an irrigation canal onto raised beds in a mango farm in Mutubas. The trees have just started to blossom, next year could be their first harvest. Ouf el-Zoughby, one of the farmers, said this is his third time trying to grow mangos. Past attempts have been thwarted by salt. \u201cYou see the tree dying before your eyes,\u201d the 47-year-old farmer said, remembering how he had to pull the husks out one-by-one. His fields are within 3 kilometers of the Mediterranean. This time, he\u2019s hoping the newly elevated farmlands and a government-built runoff system will help them survive, in addition to expensive chemical fertilizers. He\u2019s not sure what he will do if the crop fails again. He worries that without more government help, thousands could desert their farms. A Cop27 sign on the road leading to the conference area in Egypt\u2019s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh The area has always been exposed to the nearby sea, but formers say salinity was kept in check by supplies of fresh water and silt from the Nile. Even after the construction of the Aswan High Dam over 50 years ago ended seasonal flooding, fresh water still reached the fields through canals. But even that has lessened, as the government has rationed agricultural water use, to account for the country's growing population. There's no longer enough to wash away the salt. Further down the coast on the eastern side of the Delta, concrete barriers have been put down just outside the city of Port Said, aiming to keep the rising waves back. Abdel-Wahab Ramadan, a 61-year-old retired engineer, remembers spending summer vacations on white sand beaches here 30 years ago. Now, his grandchildren play next to the massive wave breakers in the muddy shallows. \u201cWe are aware that this is necessary, but there are protection methods better than this ugly one,\u201d he said. They are still just a half measure. They were not enough to stop waves from flooding beach-side restaurants and cafes in the town of Ras el-Bar in recent winters. Many now close during the winter months. \u201cLast year, we spent a week to repair the place, but unfortunately water flooded it again,\u201d said Abd Allah Gareib, who manages a caf\u00e9 by the beach. It sustained water damage the past two years. This year, the sea already crossed the first two lines of wave breakers in October. The barriers and runoff systems are part of government efforts to protect the Delta from climate change\u2019s effects. Egypt\u2019s former Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mohamed Abdel-Atty, said in January the government had installed concrete barriers on 120 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast, meant to shelter 17 million people. That is equivalent to about half the coastline of the Delta and the city of Alexandria. Egypt's entire Mediterranean coast stretches 990 kilometres (615 miles). Abdel-Atty said they were also working to build a warning system to alert any climatic changes like rises in sea levels. At the same time, authorities are trying to put a stop to high-polluting practices, like brick-making and an old farming custom, the burning of rice straw, which shrouds the Delta\u2019s skies with smoke every year after the harvest. But there\u2019s an understanding from Egyptians that this is a small step in tackling a global problem. \u201cThough Egypt contributes 0.6 per cent of the global carbon dioxide emissions, it is one of the most vulnerable (countries) to the impacts of climate change, and the agriculture sector and food production are the most affected,\u201d said Abdel Monem, the FAO\u2019s expert.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Most of the world\u2019s population has been affected in some way by climate change \u2014 85% of the world, in fact. But the effects of climate change haven\u2019t been equally felt by all. Some communities have seen a slight rise in temperature here and there, but others have had their entire communities wiped out. As the rise of global temperatures and sea-level continues to affect the world with increasingly frequency and intensity, who are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change? ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. ___ The answer is clear, according to climate scientists, climate and environmental justice experts and international research efforts on the question. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in a 2022 report that vulnerability to climate change is \u201cexacerbated by inequity and marginalization linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof.\u201d \u201c(The) poor, ethnic minorities, and women are very clearly the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change that we are already seeing today: heat waves; displacement and smoke due to fires; and price shocks due to supply chain interruptions, higher energy prices,\u201d Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley and a coordinating lead author on IPCC reports, told The Associated Press. These populations are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of racism, sexism and pursuit of profits over protection of people, according to Bineshi Albert , co-executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance. \u201cDue to the continued search for profits by our current economic system and (by) the fossil fuel industry in particular, there are entire neighborhoods that are deemed worthy of becoming sacrifice zones, and this breaks down every time around race, class, and national lines,\u201d she said. Research also shows that disabled people are more vulnerable to effects of climate change than abled bodied people. The increased vulnerability to climate change experienced by these populations and who is to blame for causing these inequities have become increasing topics of conversation at the international level. Debate about loss and damage \u2014 the climate harm caused by some nations to others, how much and what should be done about it \u2014 has waged on since at least COP23. A study published in July 2022 found that richer nations like the U.S. caused climate harm to poorer countries. In terms of repairing damage already caused to vulnerable populations and countries and helping them become less vulnerable, experts told the AP that it starts with including them in developing policies. \u201cA natural start is to develop policies to target these underserved communities with enhanced attention and support,\u201d Kammen said. Albert said it should go a step further with direct economic investments in communities most vulnerable to climate change. \u201cEconomic resources should go directly to those on the frontlines of the climate crisis to develop and implement their own community-led solutions,\u201d she said. \u201c Communities rather than profits must be the motive if we are truly going to solve the climate crisis.\u201d ___ Follow Drew Costley on Twitter: @drewcostley. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile As the world warms and extreme weather events mount, governments and corporations have been called on to address climate change by top officials, climate scientists and activists and to curb levels of heating. The planet's temperature has already risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) and the effects will only get worse with every additional tenth of a degree of warming, scientists warn. ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series answering some of the most fundamental questions around climate change, the science behind it, the effects of a warming planet and how the world is addressing it. ___ Scientists and officials agree that it's important to not make matters worse by burning even more fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 that emit heat-trapping gases into the air. In a 2021 report, the International Energy Agency said there can be no new investments in fossil fuels if the world wants to reach its climate goals. The most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change said \u201cimmediate and deep\" cuts to dirty fuels were needed. \u201cOur addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the 2021 climate conference in Glasgow, known as COP26. The world is currently reliant on fossil fuels for much of its electricity, heating and transportation, as well as agriculture and industry. It's hoped that cleaner alternatives \u2014 such as solar and wind energy \u2014 will replace much of that demand. As costs of renewables plummet, more and more energy is being produced in sustainable ways, although the total amount of energy produced globally has also gone up. \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a rapid uptake of renewables, but emissions are continuing to rise,\u201d said Elizabeth Robinson , the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment's director. \u201cWe also need to see overall global emissions falling, and at the moment global emissions from fossil fuels are still increasing.\u201d While renewable energy sources work well for electricity production, other industries \u2014 such as cement-making, steel and shipping \u2014 will be harder to wean off dirty fuels. That's why experts are looking into technologies that may be able to help these specific sectors, as well as the possibility of \u201cgreen fuels,\u201d such as those made out of plant materials or natural waste, known as biofuels. Newer technologies like green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy sources to make hydrogen to use for energy, and carbon capture, which sucks carbon dioxide out of the air, are also being explored but still come with a heavy price tag and are untested on a large scale. Methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but only lasts in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, will also have to be greatly reduced. Countries have vowed to plug methane leaks from oil wells and gas pipelines which would have immediate benefits for curbing warming, scientists say. Robinson also pointed to stopping deforestation and tweaking diets as solutions since forests naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Using land for agriculture, especially for livestock which also requires vast amounts of land for grazing, means forests need to be cleared and more greenhouse gases are emitted into the air. \u201cThis is a very controversial area, but in most higher income countries, most people eat far more meat than they need to,\u201d Robinson said. In addition to limiting climate change, humans will also need to learn how to live with some warming. Looking at how to rein in warming while simultaneously learning to acclimate is known as \u201cmitigation and adaptation\u201d in climate circles. Many officials and scientists say both are needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything,\" said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to say one thing\u2019s better than the other.\u201d ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

The former prime minister suggested record-breaking temperatures of 40C in July helped spark the Tory rebellion which saw him forced out of No 10. \u201cClimate change effects are all too real and visible even in the UK,\u201d Mr Johnson said at Cop27 in Egypt. \u201cTemperatures in London this July reached 40C, almost unbearable by UK standards.\u201d The former Tory leader added: \u201cPerhaps even contributing, who knows, to unexpected political turmoil that we saw at Westminster at that time.\u201d Mr Johnson \u2013 who declared himself \u201cthe spirit of Glasgow Cop26\u201d \u2013 also attacked net zero sceptics in the Tory party, warning against a \u201ccorrosive cynicism\u201d about the cost of action to cut emissions. \u201cThere are people who have drawn the conclusion that the whole project of net zero needs to be delayed, mothballed and put on ice \u2013 that we need, for instance, to reopen coal-fired power stations and frack the hell out of the British countryside,\u201d he said at New York Times event. \u201cWe really need to tackle this nonsense head on,\u201d said the former PM on the net zero \u201cnaysayers\u201d, who singled out his old Brexit ally David Frost for special criticism. Referring to Lord Frost\u2019s description of wind power as \u201cmedieval technology\u201d, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI would point out that burning oil is positively paleolithic.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe that the critics of this agenda massively underestimate the ability of human race to harness the natural world and to come up with innovative zero-carbon solutions.\u201d Rishi Sunak \u00a0is also in Egypt for the opening day of the conference \u2013 although it was unclear whether the two men would meet. The PM was accused of being dragged \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d to Cop27 to avoid being embarrassed by Mr Johnson. Asked if had been worried about the possibility Mr Sunak may have not have attended Cop27, the former Tory leader said: \u201cThe PM is here. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here \u2026 I think he\u2019s on absolutely the right lines.\u201d Asked if Mr Sunak was wrong to push for more oil and gas in the North Sea, Mr Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s right for the short-term to recognise that we\u2019ve got a transition period.\u201d Saying he was at Cop27 to warn against any \u201clurch\u201d back towards fossil fuels, he said: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m here is because I am worried that the discussion about Ukraine, about what\u2019s happening there, is having all sorts of bad effects.\u201d Mr Johnson added: \u201cIt\u2019s making people anxious about net zero, it\u2019s making people anxious about whether we can really do it. I think that the risk is that some people will go weak and wobbly on net zero, we can\u2019t have that. This is not the moment to go weak on net zero. This is not the moment to give in to [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s energy blackmail.\u201d The former PM said he hoped there would be \u201ccontinuation\u201d of US support for Ukraine after this week\u2019s mid-terms, with some Republicans keen to pull financial backing in Kyiv\u2019s struggles against Moscow. \u201cIn Europe we always call on the Americans, intermittently, to rescue some great democratic cause \u2026 They\u2019re doing it now. I\u2019m just praying that that\u2019s going to continue,\u201d said Mr Johnson. Asked about his relationship with Donald Trump , the former PM would not be drawn on the former president\u2019s bid for a second term in the White House. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to blight any American politician with support,\u201d he said.

The challenge of Sharm and Cop27 is to maintain that momentum, maintain the consensus and the financial commitments necessary, and to deliver on those Nationally Determined Contributions to cuts in fossil fuel emissions. And even that, of course, will not be enough. Every day, across the planet, big yellow machines are grubbing up forests at a terrifying rate \u2013 football fields of natural habitat lost every second; ten million hectares of forest every year. This is a catastrophe in itself, since we are losing our heritage and robbing posterity. In destroying our forests, we are eradicating the natural world, with 70 per cent of all non-human vertebrate populations gone since 1970. We are wiping out species, with 500 extinguished in the last century and a million now under threat. We are bleaching the world of genetic diversity, with human beings and domesticated animals now outweighing the biomass of all other vertebrates roughly 20 times over. We are annihilating the bioscientific potential these forest ecosystems possess to cure the diseases of the human race. We are losing sources of water, and choking the lungs of the world, since 20 per cent of the atmosphere\u2019s oxygen is made in the Amazon basin alone. In sawing down our ancient forests we are cutting our own throats \u2013 because deforestation is the second biggest cause of the climate crisis, responsible for 20 per cent of emissions. A horrific negative feedback loop is in progress. The climate crisis is causing irreparable loss of the natural world, and the loss of the natural world is accelerating the climate crisis. We need to save these habitats, and in Glasgow last year we made a start. Leaders of 145 countries came together to pledge to stop or reverse the loss of forests by 2030. The world agreed funding to stop the chainsaw massacres: $1bn for the Congo basin, $2bn to help indigenous peoples to look after their boreal environment. We secured agreement from the world\u2019s biggest food and agricultural companies \u2013 including the Chinese Cofco group \u2013 to stop buying commodities from illegally deforested land. We persuaded the world\u2019s financial institutions \u2013 with assets of $9 trillion under their command \u2013 to boycott investments that involved illegal logging or deforestation. But we must go further and faster \u2013 not just at the Cop in Sharm, but at next month\u2019s biodiversity Cop in Canada. What is happening in the world\u2019s tropical forests \u2013 the scene of 80 per cent of the destruction \u2013 is literally criminal. We are talking about illegal crops, illegal mining, illegal cattle ranching and illegal palm oil plantations. It is time to review our legislation so that these crimes face proper sanctions. We should consider what we can do to monitor these giant yellow behemoths \u2013 the machines that are doing the damage \u2013 so that they are not used for the purposes of illegal and immoral destruction of nature. We need to signal more clearly that nature is protected. We are proud that both Colombia and the United Kingdom have joined 100 countries in the High Ambition Coalition for People and Nature. That means we consecrate 30 per cent of our surface area to the natural world. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here We hope other countries will join, and we would like to see biodiversity credits to encourage countries and governments to value the natural resources they possess. We are technological optimists. We believe that humanity has the means to cut CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. We can clearly see a way to clean power and clean transport. But we cannot tackle climate change unless we save the great forests of the world and the natural splendours they contain. This is not just a question of aesthetics or morality. It is a question of human survival.

{"id":null,"body":" Guests at royal reception include Stella McCartney and John Kerry Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Rishi Sunak has told a Cop27 reception hosted by King Charles at Buckingham Palace that the world will experience \u201cmore human suffering\u201d if we continue to allow \u201cclimate change to ravage our planet\u201d. The prime minister is attending the UN climate conference in Egypt next week after a U-turn, but Charles will miss the gathering of world leaders, business figures and environmentalists. The King has long campaigned on environmental issues, and last autumn he told the Cop26 talks in Glasgow that the world had had enough of talking and commitments needed to be put into practice. But the \u201csoft power\u201d diplomacy of the monarchy will be absent from the international gathering at Egypt\u2019s Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. During Liz Truss\u2019s brief premiership, a \u201cunanimous agreement\u201d was reached that the King should not attend Cop27 after advice was sought by his office from the government. At a reception in the Buckingham Palace ballroom on Friday, Mr Sunak said: \u201cAs recent events have shown, delivering on the promise of Glasgow is more important than ever. \u201cMore important because, as we have seen so starkly with the war in Ukraine, it is vital to invest in secure, renewable sources of energy and sustainable food production. \u201cMore important because every moment we allow climate change to ravage our planet we will see more human suffering like the devastating floods in Pakistan. \u201cAnd more important because, if we do not act today, we will risk leaving an ever more desperate inheritance for our children.\u201d Among the guests at the palace from the world of finance, technology, transport and agribusiness were a number of government figures, including environment secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, business secretary Grant Shapps, international trade secretary Kemi Badenoch and Cop26 president Alok Sharma. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was also in attendance, alongside Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, while foreign leaders included Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador Prince Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud. Mr Sharma, who will be handing over the UK\u2019s presidency to Egypt at the summit, has reportedly said he would \u201cwelcome\u201d Charles\u2019s presence at Cop27, while fellow guest John Kerry , America\u2019s special envoy on climate change, echoed his words, telling Sky News recently it would be \u201cvery powerful\u201d if the King was in Egypt. Fashion designer and sustainability activist Stella McCartney was asked at the reception if it would be a \u201cgood idea\u201d for the King to attend Cop27, and she replied: \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have him everywhere talking on this subject matter, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to do so.\u201d McCartney, who joked with Charles when she first met him, went on to say: \u201cThat\u2019s really the beauty of today and the work that King Charles has been doing. He is truly getting the world leaders in business and the world leaders in politics into the same room. \u201cThey\u2019re all here for one reason \u2013 people are facing problems, we need solutions and we all have to work together.\u201d In his speech the prime minister also paid tribute to the King for \u201chelping to find practical solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss for more than 50 years, long before Cop1, let alone Cop27.\u201d He added: \u201cThe reduction in global emissions pledged during our presidency is now equivalent to more than six times the annual emissions of the entire global aviation industry.\u201d Addressing the guests, Mr Sunak said that perhaps the greatest breakthrough in the UK\u2019s presidency of Cop26 was an idea suggested by Charles: bringing together leading investors and businesses at Glasgow to direct the world\u2019s wealth at protecting the climate. He said: \u201cAs a result of what many of you here are doing today, we\u2019re turning the fight against climate change into a fantastic source of new green jobs and growth.\u201d Charles ended the day by planting a lime tree in Buckingham Palace\u2019s garden as part of the Queen\u2019s Green Canopy project, thought to be the first time he has carried out a tree-planting ceremony as monarch. The initiative has planted more than a million trees across the UK to honour and celebrate the Queen\u2019s 70 years of service to the nation.

{"id":null,"body":" Exclusive: \u2018Climate change is not waiting for us to fix our other problems,\u2019 Mohamed Nasr warns Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile The climate crisis will only be taken seriously when countries realise it is an existential threat like Covid , Cop27 host\u2019s chief negotiator warns. As international delegations arrive in Egypt from across the world, ambassador Mohamed Nasr said the climate crisis would not wait for humanity to solve its other problems, pointing to deaths in Pakistan caused by climate-fuelled extreme flooding . The Cop27 climate summit will open its doors in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday in a bid to make tangible progress on a host of issues from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to helping developing countries adapt to a warming planet. Ambassador Mohamed Nasr says climate needs to be treated like Covid Mr Nasr said a key goal of the critical conference was to keep climate change at the top of the international agenda at a time when countries face a litany of challenges including Russia \u2019s invasion of Ukraine and linked soaring energy and food prices. \u201cEverybody is saying, yes, we\u2019re committed \u2026 but the national circumstances are making things difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is not waiting for us to fix our other problems, and let\u2019s not forget that when Covid was an existential threat to all of us, in one year the international community could mobilise more than, I don\u2019t know $15 trillion, not $100 billion, in one year. So this is a reality check. When parties decide, and when countries and stakeholders know that this is an existential threat \u2026 they will take it seriously.\u201d Another important goal of the summit will be to identify the hurdles countries face when attempting to implement rapid and significant change on the ground, he said. National climate plans need to shift from being a headline goal that countries aim to meet to showing how countries will get there, he added. \u201cLet\u2019s see what is needed to deliver, this is our big goal as Cop presidency, let\u2019s see what is needed: is it technology, is it finance, is it access?\u201d he questioned. Asked if Britain\u2019s Cop26 president Alok Sharma had given him any advice ahead of handing over the reins to Egypt, Mr Nasr said Mr Sharma had told him to push for ambition, but also to be realistic, and make sure the non-political stakeholders were also engaged. \u201cI\u2019m pushing for the maximum and this is what any presidency will do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also constrained by the challenges that parties are facing.\u201d Cop27 gets underway at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre Last year it was Covid and economies emerging from the impacts of the pandemic, this year it\u2019s Covid, geopolitics, food, energy, finance, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a myriad of challenges,\u201d he said, adding that the international community had to make sure multilateralism was still working, and not allow politics to spill over into the climate negotiations. In a word of caution, he added that addressing climate change required a major economic transformation that would not take place overnight. He also said negotiations over a full stop, or over wording such as \u201cshall\u201d rather than \u201cshould\u201d mattered and had on-the-ground consequences. \u201cYou cannot expect a Cop, a single Cop or two Cops or three Cops will change the course of the international economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are on track,\u201d he added, although he acknowledged that the speed and scale of change was not yet there. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to discuss. Why aren\u2019t we going at scale, why are we not going at speed,\u201d he said.

{"id":null,"body":" \u2018Highway to climate hell\u2019: UN chief warns world losing battle against warming Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Rishi Sunak has dealt a blow to the developing countries hardest-hit by climate change by shunning appeals for the UK to contribute towards reparations for the natural disasters caused by hundreds of years of industrial pollution. Thirty-year-old demands for a fund to pay for the permanent loss and damage caused by extreme weather were discussed for the first time on the floor of the Cop27 climate change conference in Egypt , with calls for the UK and other rich nations to join Belgium, Denmark and Scotland in committing cash. But the prime minister made no reference to the topic in his five-minute speech in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, instead recommitting to a 2020 pledge of \u00a311.6bn for climate funding over five years and tripling to \u00a31.5bn the UK\u2019s contribution towards measures to boost resilience against future disasters. Handing over the presidency of the United Nations climate change process following last year\u2019s UK-hosted summit in Glasgow, Mr Sunak insisted there was \u201croom for hope\u201d if the struggle against climate change becomes \u201ca global mission for new jobs and clean growth\u201d though renewable energy. But his optimistic tone clashed with a warning from UN secretary general Antonio Guterres that the world was \u201con a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator\u201d. \u201cWe are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing,\u201d Mr Gutteres told delegates. \u201cGreenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.\u201d Former US vice-president Al Gore called for an end to the \u201cculture of death\u201d represented by fossil fuel extraction. \u201cWe continue to use the thin blue atmosphere as an open sewer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is getting steadily worse. We are not doing enough.\u201d In Glasgow, Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon took the hugely symbolic step of committing \u00a32m to an international \u201closs and damage\u201d fund. Scotland\u2019s initiative has since been followed by Denmark and Belgium, which announced \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.2m) in finance for Mozambique on Monday. On Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon announced another \u00a35m and urged other countries to follow suit. \u201cI think what\u2019s important here at Cop27 is that we find the common ground and make the progress towards serious financing,\u201d Ms Sturgeon told\u00a0 The Independent . \u201cCountries in the global north that have caused climate change and have the greatest access to resources have an obligation to step up.\u201d Activists at Cop27 called on Britain to follow suit. \u201cThe UK has largely dragged its feet on loss and damage,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, the director of think tank Power Shift Africa. \u201cWe need them to step up.\u201d Alejandra Padin-Dujon, of Catholic development charity Cafod, said London should be pledging billions, not millions, to making good the damage caused by floods, wildfires and cyclones caused by global warming. \u201cThe UK has consistently not shown leadership in this area,\u201d said Ms Padin-Dujon. \u201cLoss and damage has been thrown by the wayside.\u201d A succession of developing country and small island state leaders described how extreme weather had wreaked devastation costing hundreds of billions of pounds. By 2030, losses and damages are estimated to cost developing countries somewhere between $290bn (\u00a3250bn) and $580bn a year. By mid-century, that is predicted to go up to between $1,132bn and $1,741bn. Nabeel Munir, envoy for Pakistan, where recent floods left almost a third of the country underwater, said for Cop27 to be considered a success, it must deliver \u201csomething clear and tangible\u201d on a loss and damage funding mechanism, with final agreement no later than Cop29 in 2024. Flooding in Pakistan left almost a third of the country underwater And Barbados PM Mia Mottley said the energy giants producing climate change should be paying 10 per cent of their profits into a loss and damage fund, alongside developed countries like the UK. \u201cHow do oil and gas companies make $200bn in the last three months and not expect to contribute?\u201d she asked. \u201cOur people on this Earth deserve better and our leaders know better. I ask the people of the world to hold us accountable. The choice is ours \u2013 what will we choose to save?\u201d Ahead of this week\u2019s summit, Mr Guterres described a loss and damage fund as a \u201cmoral imperative that cannot be ignored\u201d at Cop27. Cabinet minister Grant Shapps signalled on Monday that the UK was \u201csupportive of discussions\u201d about reparations, saying: \u201cWe industrialised first and we appreciate the rest of the world needs to be able to bring themselves along as well.\u201d And French president Emmanuel Macron said it was time for the global north to \u201ccome to terms with the idea of financial solidarity\u201d. But Mr Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson insisted: \u201cWe are not talking about reparations or liability. We are talking about continuing to provide support for countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\" And former prime minister Boris Johnson suggested that reparations were unaffordable for developed countries. \u201cTwo hundred years ago, we started it all and there\u2019s no question that per capita, people in the UK have put out an awful lot of carbon into the atmosphere,\u201d he told a meeting on the margin of the summit. \u201cBut what we cannot do is make up for that with some kind of reparations. We simply do not have the financial resources \u2014 and no country could.\u201d Mr Sunak risks likely rebellion from his own MPs if he accepts the principle of restitution for past damage. Former minister David Jones, a member of the climate-sceptic Net Zero Scrutiny Group, told The Independent : \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be signing the first cheque in what could become a book full of blank cheques. \"I think we have to be very, very careful about doing something that is tokenistic. Our overseas aid budget has been pared back recently, but it has been one of the most generous in the world. I think that is what the government should be focusing on.\" Oxfam\u2019s GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said Mr Sunak\u2019s silence on loss and damage was \u201cdeafening\u201d. \u201cRich nations like the UK, which have done most to contribute to climate change, have a moral obligation to provide funding to help low-income countries deal with the devastating impacts of an escalating climate crisis they did little to cause,\u201d he said. Mariana Paoli, global advocacy lead at Christian Aid, said that the UK was \u201cblocking progress behind the scenes\u201d on loss and damage. \u201cRishi Sunak cannot claim to be a green leader whilst ignoring the plight of the most vulnerable,\u201d she said.

Mary Friel, of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said that the human experience of the impact of climate change \u201crequires recognition and requires finance\u201d. She called on the UK to pledge funds and to push for loss and damage to become a permanent item on subsequent climate summits\u2019 agendas. James Cameron, a UK government-appointed adviser to Cop26 in Glasgow, denied the UK had been a \u201claggard\u201d on the issue, with Cop26 president Alok Sharma acting as \u201cvery good diplomatic envoy\u201d to push it onto the agenda. But Labour\u2019s climate change spokesperson Ed Miliband dismissed Mr Sunak\u2019s speech as \u201cvacuous and empty\u201d. \"As Rishi Sunak preaches about clean energy abroad, he is the man who blocks onshore wind [power] at home while giving massive tax breaks to fossil fuel companies who are making billions in windfall profits at the expense of the British people,\u201d said Mr Miliband.

{"id":null,"body":" Cop27: My grandfather knew that the struggle for South Africa could not succeed without religious values bridging communities, writes Ndileka Mandela  Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Ending apartheid required compassion, truth and reconciliation. Climate change will require the same T o see women, especially young women, at the forefront of climate activism is inspiring. Especially because the cause can otherwise feel overwhelming. Recently, Greta Thunberg held us all to account. There is, she insisted, insufficient \u201cmoral and political leadership on the climate crisis\u201d. Could anyone argue she\u2019s wrong? At Cop27 , there\u2019s a lot of talk about climate finance. That\u2019s well and good, but the real reason we aren\u2019t making progress, the real reason we\u2019re on the verge of catastrophe, is because we aren\u2019t speaking to people in languages that resonate. Language that inspires us to make hard choices. Everything else is just information. We don\u2019t lack for science, after all. We certainly have the wealth \u2013 at least collectively. But how do you go from there to convincing people they need to sacrifice, that they\u2019re connected to people they\u2019ve never met and yet on whose willingness to join the struggle their own future depends? We can look to my grandfather\u2019s example for more. When Nelson Mandela led our country in the struggle against apartheid, he wasn\u2019t just guided by his own moral and ethical vision . That vision enabled him to build partnerships with like-minded leaders who helped bring everyday South Africans along. Case in point: my grandfather was a man of faith. More intensely in private, but genuinely all the same. He knew that the struggle for South Africa could not succeed without religious values bridging communities \u2013 another reason the late Desmond Tutu\u2019s presence was so critical to ending apartheid. The movement led by the African National Congress and its allies eventually transformed how tens of millions saw themselves. Political change required moral courage. Apartheid happened in South Africa, of course, but in other countries, too. The fight was uneven and stretched out over decades and even centuries, but we have made immense progress. Stopping climate change requires political change too, and that political change requires moral courage. But this time, the fight is happening everywhere and all at once. Without changing hearts and minds individually, without providing them with a compelling and meaningful moral framework that can help move the needle and drive mass action, we have zero chance of anything but climate apocalypse. If I\u2019m using a word with religious resonances, that\u2019s on purpose. I think Greta Thunberg\u2019s work is important. I hope she continues her brave and necessary activism. She is a hero to many and rightly so. But here\u2019s the thing: does her message translate in other countries and in other cultures? To move people, we have to start with where they are, not where we think they are. I come from and connect to the global south. In the global south \u2013 but not only the global south \u2013 religion is kind of a big deal. More than eight out of 10 people worldwide identify with a faith tradition. But how often do politicians work with religious leaders to address shared human challenges? The G20\u2019s annual gathering in Bali opened this month with the Religion Forum (R20), promoted by Indonesia\u2019s biggest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), alongside the Muslim World League \u2013 the world\u2019s largest Islamic non-governmental organisation. Through their moral and religious capital, they have drawn over three hundred faith leaders to the R20. These faith leaders represent all the great faiths of the world, convened to address challenges that bind all human communities. The secretary-general of the Muslim World League, Dr Mohammed bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa, and the NU\u2019s general chairman, Yahya Cholil Staquf, jointly called on political leaders to engage with faith leaders on shared challenges. With so many leaders from Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish denominations, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the potential. But will the world leaders attending the G20 seize the opportunity to engage these faith leaders to literally help save the planet? To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Tragically, divisions across the world, between regions, religions and geopolitical blocs have hindered climate action. For people in the global south, the failure of the world\u2019s richest nations \u2013 largely the source of historic and present emissions \u2013 to have made good on their promise of $100bn (\u00a387bn) in climate finance is galling. The echoes of colonialism \u2013 what is not unfairly sometimes called climate colonialism \u2013 are hard to miss. Yet we cannot allow ourselves to descend to anger, even if anger is warranted. Too much is at stake. Ending apartheid required compassion, truth and reconciliation. Climate change will require the same. And faith leaders will be necessary to help us get there. In many places in the global south, there are few leaders except religious leaders. Their networks, credibility and connections to bigger institutions and larger frameworks will be vital. That is something people in the West must understand if they want to reverse climate change. The R20 and the G20 make vital space for those exchanges to happen. Without their motivation, it is nearly impossible to imagine anything else that can convince enough people the world over to do what needs to be done. Let\u2019s get the work started \u2013 while we still can. Ndileka Mandela is a writer, social activist and head of the Thembekile Mandela Foundation.

The Hay Wain has been reimagined as if Constable had painted the picture in the summer of 2022, when Britain and Europe witnessed record temperatures. The once lush riverside scene is rendered barren, surrounded by scorched earth, in a new version which clearly warns of the dangers of global warming. And Sir John Everett Millais\u2019s Ophelia in the Stream is reworked to reflect the pollution of Britain\u2019s rivers, streams and waterways which dominated the UK news cycle this summer. The re-imagined artworks were created by digital artist Quentin Devine. Richard Wilson\u2019s The Thames near Marble Hill, Twickenham illustrates the devastating impact fly tipping can have on the British countryside \u2013 as shopping trolleys, mattresses and assorted household junk are added to the scene. George Seurat\u2019s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte illustrates the epidemic of urban loneliness which has come to light following Covid-19, with the original large crowds reduced to a lone man sat with head bowed in quiet contemplation. Sir John Everett Millais\u2019s \u2018Ophelia\u2019 (1851-2) has been reimagined to reflect the pollution of Britain's rivers Finally, Lowry\u2019s acclaimed Coming Home from the Mill is reconfigured to show a single worker reflecting the change in working patterns and again highlighting the issue of social isolation. The artworks are being displayed until 17 November at Samsung\u2019s flagship shop in Kings Cross. The brand is running a competition for young people to suggest ways of improving the world through technology. Sophie Edgerley Harris, from Samsung, said: \u201cThe artworks that Quentin Devine has created aim to illustrate in a unique way the societal topics that young people in the UK today are most motivated to positively contribute to.\u201d Mr Devine added: \u201cReinventing the classics with a modern twist was a huge challenge but something of a labour of love- as many of the issues highlighted are close to my heart. \u201cThe pictures highlighting Britain\u2019s past and present, but there is a lot we can do about the future and that is why projects like \u2018Solve for Tomorrow\u2019 are so important.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" The actor also pointed out other celebrities who could change their name to highlight aspects of the climate crisis, like \u2018Amy Poehler Bears Are Endangered\u2019 Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Climate activists have recently chosen many ways to bring attention to the ongoing crisis. Some have marched in the streets, some have blocked roads and others have thrown food at paintings. But actor Rainn Wilson , known for his role as Dwight Schrute on the American television show \u201c The Office \u201d, is changing his name. Mr Wilson announced this week that he is changing his name to \u201cRainfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson\u201d in a bid to highlight the climate crisis and the severe weather it will bring. The stunt comes as world leaders are meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt for Cop27 , the United Nations\u2019 annual climate conference, with hopes of furthering global cooperation to stem the climate crisis. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this name change brings attention to this growing... er, melting issue,\u201d Mr Wilson said in a press release from Arctic Basecamp, an organization of scientists who raise awareness on the climate crisis. The actor is a member of Arctic Basecamp\u2019s advisory board. \u201cWe need world leaders at COP27 to take notice and take action. The Arctic is melting at millions of litres per second, yet this problem can\u2019t seem to make a name for itself, so it\u2019s up to us to make a name for it.\u201d In a video posted to social media, the actor introduced himself as an even longer and slightly modified version of the new name. \u201cHi there, I\u2019m Rainn Wilson \u2014 or should I say: \u2018Rainfall Heat Wave Rising Sea Levels And We Have To Do Something About It Now Wilson,\u201d Mr Wilson said. \u201cSorry to get so dark, so quick.\u201d The bit is part of a campaign from Arctic Basecamp to raise awareness on the climate crisis with their \u201cname generator\u201d \u2014 an online tool where people can input their name and get a \u201cnew\u201d middle name that highlights some of the severe weather impacts of a warming planet, like \u201cGreenland Glacier Melt\u201d or \u201cSoaring Temperatures\u201d. In the video, Mr Wilson also noted some other celebrities who could change their name to highlight aspects of the climate crisis, like \u201cCardi The Arctic B Melting\u201d and \u201cAmy Poehler Bears Are Endangered\u201d. \u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d the actor said in the press release. \u201cI\u2019m as serious as the melting Arctic, which amplifies global risks including extreme weather events around the globe.\u201d Variety reports that it is unclear whether Mr Wilson is legally changing his name. The climate crisis is changing weather all over the globe \u2014 but in the Arctic, it\u2019s leading to some especially profound changes. The far northern edges of the planet are warming about four times faster than the rest of the planet, experts say. In addition to shrinking the amount of sea that forms every winter, those warmer temperatures are also melting ice sheets and glaciers in places like Greenland \u2014 leading to rising seas all over the world and putting coastal cities like Miami, Lagos and Mumbai. Those changes in the Arctic have implications for the rest of the world, Arctic Basecamp points out. \u201cRapid Arctic warming exacerbates catastrophic and costly global risks including extreme weather events, threats to food and water security, sea level rise and supply chain disruption\u00a0around the world,\u201d Gail Whiteman , the organization\u2019s founder and a sustainability researcher at the University of Exeter, said in the statement.

Their report warns that rising sea levels capable of submerging coastal communities and extreme heat \"intolerable to the human body\", are examples of the \"hard\" limits of our ability to adapt, and which we now face in growing areas of the world. It also highlights how over 3 billion people will inhabit \"vulnerability hotspots\" \u2013 areas with the highest susceptibility to being adversely affected by climate-driven hazards \u2013 by 2050, which is double the number of people who live in these areas today. The assessment also warns that humanity\u2019s persistent dependence on fossil fuels is continuing to exacerbate major vulnerabilities, particularly impacting energy and food security. \"Deep and swift mitigation to tackle the drivers of climate change is immediately necessary to avert and minimise future loss and damage,\" they say. The report, convened by the international networks Future Earth, The Earth League, World Climate Research Programme, warns that \"only through ambitious mitigation efforts and systemic transformation, can we avoid facing widespread limits to adaptation , and increased losses and damage\". Professor Mercedes Bustamente, from the University of Brasilia, in Brazil, said: \u201cPeople and ecosystems in different places across the world are already confronted with enormous impacts, and if the planet warms beyond 1.5\/2C, more widespread breaching of adaptation limits can be expected. \"Adaptation efforts cannot substitute for ambitious mitigation.\" The only approach which can stave off these existential threats is enormous international collaboration by governments to radically implement policies which protect us in future, the experts say. \"The latest science confirms the rising social costs of severe climate extremes and the urgent need to deviate away from risks of going beyond limits to adaptation and crossing irreversible tipping points,\" said Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, co-chair of the Earth League, the Earth Commission and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

We can only adapt to the climate crisis up to a point, so we must take action to limit the damage, scientists warn \"As science advances, we have more evidence of massive costs, risks but also global benefits of reduced loss and damage, through an orderly safe landing of the world within the Paris climate range,\" he said. \"To succeed requires global collaboration and speed at an unprecedented scale.\" But the team also warned that in order for action to have an adequate impact, a holistic approach must be taken by policymakers, in which they recognise the links between the climate crisis, the broader natural world and the clash with the demands of our civilisation as it currently operates. \u201cDecision makers must recognise the interconnectedness of biophysical-social challenges, and that the most impactful responses are not siloed,\" said Professor Chukwumerije Okereke, of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, in Nigeria. \"Substantially shifting the allocation of capital and land use towards meaningful mitigation, enacting robust and coordinated global policy responses for adaptation, loss and damage, as well as deconstructing the barriers to just climate action are some of the approaches identified within the report to accelerate reaching Paris Agreement goals.\" The report was launched at Cop27 and can be read here .

{"id":null,"body":" Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events linked to more severe symptoms Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile As the planet becomes warmer, people with neurologic diseases such as headaches , dementia , multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson\u2019s disease may experience worsening symptoms, scientists have warned. A review of studies published on climate change and neurologic diseases showed that extreme weather events and fluctuations in temperature were associated with a higher prevalence of stroke, as well as migraine headaches, hospitalisation of dementia patients, and worsening MS. Extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations were particularly linked to these symptoms becoming more severe. The review, published in the Neurology journal of the American Academy of Neurology on Wednesday (16 November), also showed that climate change resulted in \u201cfavourable conditions\u201d that encourage the spread of neuroinfectious diseases, such as West Nile virus, meningococcal meningitis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Such conditions have expanded \u201cbeyond the traditional geographic areas\u201d due to global warming and these diseases carried by animals and insects put new populations at risk, it said. Exposure to airborne pollutants, like nitrates and fine particulate matter, has also been associated with stroke incidence and severity, headaches, dementia risk, Parkinson\u2019s disease and worsening of MS, the review added. Dr Andrew Dhawan, from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and author of the review, said that despite the international community\u2019s attempts to reduce global temperature rise to under 2C, \u201cirreversible environmental changes have already occurred\u201d. \u201cAs we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how neurologic disease may change,\u201d he added. The review, which looked at studies published on climate change, pollutants, temperature extremes and neurologic diseases between 1990 and 2022, found 364 relevant studies in three categories. This included 289 studies on the impact of pollution, 38 on extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations, and 37 on emerging neuroinfectious diseases. But Dr Dhawan said some of the challenges posed by climate change on humanity are \u201cnot well-studied\u201d. \u201cFor example, our review did not find any articles related to effects on neurological health from food and water insecurity, yet these are clearly linked to neurologic health and climate change,\u201d he explained. \u201cMore studies are needed on ways to reduce neuroinfectious disease transmission, how air pollution affects the nervous system, and how to improve delivery of neurologic care in the face of climate-related disruptions.\u201d Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{\/verifyErrors}} By clicking \u2018Create my account\u2019 you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our\u00a0 Terms of use, \u00a0 Cookie policy \u00a0and\u00a0 Privacy notice.

{"id":null,"body":" ActionAid\u2019s photo essay series features women and girls from Bangladesh, Kenya, Somaliland and Senegal who are battling against climate change Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Meet the women fighting against the impacts of climate change This has been a year of climate catastrophes from floods in Pakistan and Nigeria to the worst droughts on record across the Horn of Africa. Among the least insulated and most disproportionately affected are women and girls. As Cop27 reaches it final day, it is vital that these women are central to the climate conversation - yet their stories are all too often just a footnote. ActionAid research recently found how climate change is increasing gender-based violence and damaging women\u2019s mental health, as women and girls are being pushed to drop out of school or marry early, to help manage the financial stress that their families face during droughts or floods. Women featured in this photo essay are looking to world leaders to scale up community focused financial support to help them adapt and become more resilient to future impacts. Bangladesh In June 2022 the Badaghat union of Bishwamvarpur upazila in northeastern Bangladesh was hit with the worst flash floods the country has seen in 100 years. There was widespread decimation of transport, communications networks and clean water facilities leaving thousands with extremely limited access to food. Estimates predict that 4 million people were left stranded including 1.6 million children. Bangladesh is one of the most climate-impacted countries in the world and is at constant risk of severe flooding. Sunati, 30, from northeastern Bangladesh: \u201cIt is difficult for my husband to feed all of us in this circumstance. The flood has taken away everything from us.\u201d Sunati is a member of ActionAid Bangladesh\u2019s Reflection Action circle. Her family of seven is dependent on her husband\u2019s earning as a fisherman, but when there are floods, he cannot fish, and his earnings vanish. The family home and surrounding area becomes filthy and muddy when there is flooding and unhygienic - leaving them with almost nothing. Aseda, 34, in northeastern Bangladesh, lives with her three sons and husband, who is the only earning member of the family Aseda\u2019s husband is a day labourer and now struggling to find any work due to the floods. Her family has been living a life with scarcity of food, safe drinking water, hygiene, and other necessary commodities since the flooding occured. She is apprehensive about her children\u2019s education and how her family can turn around from the loss. Shabana, 26, in northeastern Bangladesh: \u201cBefore the flood, I was living a good life with my husband and two sons and one daughter. We were self-reliant.\u201d Shabana was badly affected by the flash floods earlier in June this year which washed away some of her livestock She said: \u201cWe and my cattle are all now starving. I don\u2019t even know how we will survive the coming days. We can only survive if the cows survive, as they are our only asset and source of livelihood now.\u201d Kenya As a marginalised community, Pokot women from Tangulbei, Kenya, are all too used to experiencing severe impacts of climate crises. As well as commonly being the main breadwinners - they are also the ones leading the way to provide the solutions. Many are now leading a movement empowering over 3,000 women in their communities to address climate justice through the establishment and diversification of income-generating activities, by encouraging small-scale businesses and promoting women\u2019s financial inclusion projects. Jeniffer, 61, who was forced to marry at the age of 13, has been the driving force to influence women and girls in Tangulbei, to continue with education and resist child marriages As the climate crisis worsens, Jeniffer has focused on teaching women how to adapt their sources of income, turn to small businesses and abandon their unproductive farms due to rapid weather changes and irregular rain patterns. She organised a five-day climb to the peak of Mt Kilimanjaro to demand land and natural resource rights for women, through the implementation of an inclusive African Women\u2019s charter. Jeniffer said: \u201cGirls are no longer going to school because of climate change as they don\u2019t have food. For the girls at the moment, the issue of forced child marriage is at its highest point because of hunger. Girls are being married off because their community count them as wealth.\u201d Susan, 33, spends hours daily queuing to fetch some cooking water at the only water well in her locality Susan lives in Tangulbei and has shown her resolve in the face of increasing climate shocks. With over 90% of open water sources drying up in northern Kenya, the well she spend hours queuing for is a resource so scarce that it fuels conflict. She, like many other women, worry about the safety when walking long distances to fetch water. There is a high prevalence of violence and rape especially around the few remaining water holes, but she has no choice but to go to these sources of water. Ruth, 60 in Tangulbei Ruth Aule abandoned farming after the rivers close to her farm dried up and the rains became irregular. She resorted to selling cakes for a small income, although most days she comes back empty-handed. Her young daughter had an unwanted pregnancy which has put further financial stress on the family. As her daughter needed to go back to school and finish her primary school exams, Ruth cannot trade anymore. Chepleke, 53, in Tangulbei: \u201cI feel these effects of climate change alone and have no one to turn to,\u201d Chepleke says when she was younger there were many rivers freely flowing close to her home. She is now a widow who struggles to find drinking water after these rivers have dried up, leaving her community to fight over rapidly dwindling resources. She resorted to brewing for a more stable source of income and pleads for world leaders to provide a sustainable source of water close to her that feeds and sustains her community while helping her to pursue a viable income. Amina, in Isiolo, used to be a livestock famer who was forced to change farming methods and now specialises in home gardening Amina\u2019s village is currently experiencing a drought and her children must walk far to collect water. The drought is impacting women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safety in the area, including rape and domestic violence increases, and a rise in early marriages. She is also involved with an education group that supports women with weather predictions to help navigate planting and weather changes. They update the community through social media and warn people of the seasons ahead. Rosemary, in Isiolo, is a local leader and works with a youth activist networks and severe drought is her biggest concern The impact on women and girls is staggering, Rosemary has seen a rise in girls dropping out of school and young girls getting into early marriages due to shortage of food. Somaliland East Africa is facing its worst food crisis for decades, following four years of failed harvests, erratic rainfall and rocketing global food prices. Up to 20 million people in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are going hungry every day, with severe malnutrition amongst infants and young children. ActionAid is providing emergency aid in the form of food, livelihoods and water. They are also providing long-term development actions which are building resilience in the communities, like fruit and vegetable gardens, adopting agroecology and supporting communities to create water with more than 27, 998 households benefitting, but there is an urgent need to scale up this response to save lives and livelihoods. Deeqa in Togdheer Region: \u201cIt\u2019s the women who do everything when it comes to livestock. It is women who feed the livestock, who trade the livestock and clean their fleece.\u201d Mother of six Deeqa, 45, has lost most of her livestock due to drought as she doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy them grain. The current drought is worse than those that have come before, due to extreme weather changes and its impact has been exacerbated due to inflation which has caused food prices to spiral upwards. Young mother Shamsa, 25, lost her livestock in the 2017 drought and was forced to move to a displacement camp, with her family. Shamsa in Togdheer Region: \u201cThe most challenging thing we are facing here is that prices are increasing, and we don\u2019t have income.\u201d Her family rely on the support of humanitarian organisations like ActionAid to provide food packages, cash transfers, and other necessities. \u201cLife in the camp is difficult,\u201d Shamsa, said. \u201cWe have nothing here because we don\u2019t have proper shelter, food, water, and the other basic necessities.\u201d Sada, 30, in Maroodi Jeex region, is a farmer and her family and lifestock have all been significantly affected by drought Crops that usually feed Sada\u2019s family have died due to a lack of water and they are no longer able to sell their livestock, which have become sick and weak. She has noticed an increase in drought over the past few years as the rainfall reduces and becomes less frequent. Sada received a kit from ActionAid Somaliland, which she says has helped her at a time when the family has no income. Maya Island, Senegal The island of Maya in Senegal is home to mangrove swamps rich in biodiversity. Rising sea levels have impacted fishing and shellfish gathering which have sustained human life there. Increased intensity of storm surges has led to coastal erosion and flooding of farmland. The high levels of salt in the soil make it impossible to cultivate the fruit, vegetables and rice that were an everyday staple in the past. There is only one primary school on Maya, so children need to make a 4km journey to get to secondary school \u2013 due to rising sea levels this journey has become dangerous. Women of Maya Island The local community installed a wooden bridge for students to make the journey to the neighbouring island of Djrinda easier. But over time, the water has heavily damaged it and there is now a real problem keeping children in school. Aida, 40, is dedicated to fighting the rising sea levels. She is community development worker and a matron at the local \u2018health hut\u2019 on the island. Aida said: \u201cCan you imagine that when I came here in 1998, there were a lot of trees around here, but today you can see for yourself that there are no more trees and even the grass dries up due to the rise in sea level making the soil saltier.\u201d \u201cOur children who attend the school of Djirnda often miss their lessons because they cannot get to school and this obviously has an impact on their results.\u201d Kady on Maya Island Kady, 40, works as a fisherwoman and has had to adapt to rising sea levels in her village. She was involved in helping to build a bridge so that their children can get to school on the neighbouring island of Djrinda. Amy is president of the GIE, a local women\u2019s group that focuses on planting mangroves in order to fight the impact of climate change. She worries for the future of her children and wants them to have a good education. She believes women should oversee local initiatives to tackle the rising sea levels and the government should have more respect for the work they do. Amy in yellow on Maya Island ActionAid is an international charity that works with women and girls living in poverty. We are ending violence and fighting poverty so that all women, everywhere, can create the future they want. Learn about our vision, our mission, our approach, and our impact here .

{"id":null,"body":" Lava flows contained to the summit area with no threat to communities downslope, but the situation is being closely monitored Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Hawaii \u2019s Mauna Loa , the largest active volcano on the planet, has erupted for the first time in nearly four decades . The eruption on the state\u2019s Big Island began at around 11.30pm local time on Sunday in Mokuaweoweo, the summit caldera of the volcano , according to the National Weather Service. Lava flows are contained to the summit area, around 2.5miles above sea level, with no threat to communities downslope but the situation is being closely monitored as it can change rapidly. The eruption has triggered dozens of earthquakes with one registering at 4.2 on the richter scale. While the eruption of Mauna Loa is a rare occurrence, the climate crisis could lead to more volcanic activity, some scientists say. The greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet are melting glaciers and in turn destabilizing mountains, creating conditions for volcanic eruptions that were previously restrained. \u201cImagine the ice like some sort of protective layer \u2013 when the ice melts away, the mountain is free to collapse,\u201d Gioachino Roberti, a PhD student researching volcanic activity at the University of Clermont Auvergne, previously told The Independent. \u201cIf your mountain is a volcano you have another problem. Volcanoes are a pressurised system and if you remove pressure by ice melting and landslide, you have a problem.\u201d The 2018 study looked at Mount Meager, a glaciated volcano north of Vancouver, Canada. Its last eruption was more than 2,000 years ago, but Roberti focused on Mount Meager after a massive landslide occurred on the southern slope of the volcano in 2010. This was followed in 2016 by the formation of ice caves in the glacier as hot volcanic gases seeped out of the volcano. The study used numerical modelling of the volcano to examine the link between melting ice and changes to the magma \u201cplumbing system\u201d inside. They found that landslides had the potential to destabilise the magma chamber and trigger an eruption \u2013 a phenomenon that can be linked directly to a warmer climate. Other scientists noted the complexity of the systems and the difficulty in making direct links between the climate crisis and eruptions. \u201cEruptions are triggered by a complex array of factors,\u201d Professor David Rothery, a geoscientist at The Open University who was not involved in the research, said. \u201cI suspect that many eruptions caused by glacial melting might happen eventually anyway, given enough time \u2013 but this research shows that warming could increase the chances of those eruptions happening sooner rather than later.\u201d An international team of scientists is currently undertaking groundbreaking research into whether the climate crisis influences volcanic eruptions and the frequency of earthquakes. Off the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, the team has collected a 500-metre long core from beneath the seafloor, a record of all the sediment and material deposited over the last 800,000 years. By analyzing each layer, the scientists will build up a picture of how earthquakes and volanic eruptions have occurred over milennia. Once completed in early 2024, scientists are expected to be able to say more definitively whether or not there is a causal link between climate and the frequency of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

{"id":null,"body":" Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is pointing the finger at her homeland over climate failures Hundreds of activists including Greta Thunberg marched through the Swedish capital to a court Friday to file a lawsuit against the Swedish state for what they say is insufficient climate action. More than 600 young people under the age of 26 signed the 87-page document that is the basis for the lawsuit which was filed in the Stockholm District Court. They want the court to determine that the country has violated its citizen's human rights with its climate policies. \u201cSweden has never treated the climate crisis like a crisis,\u201d said Anton Foley, spokesman of the youth-led initiative Aurora, which prepared and filed the lawsuit. \u201cSweden is failing in its responsibility and breaking the law.\u201d The action comes as scientists warn that chances are slipping away to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. At a recent U.N. climate conference in Egypt earlier this month, leaders tried to keep that goal alive but did not ratchet up calls for reducing carbon emissions. Another activist, Ida Edling, said that Sweden \"is pursuing a climate policy the research is very clear will contribute to a climate disaster in the future.\u201d Sweden's parliament decided in 2017 said that by 2045, the Scandinavian country is to have zero net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and is to have 100% renewable energy. Swedish broadcaster TV4 said the government declined to comment on-going legal actions. Climate campaigners have launched numerous lawsuits against governments and companies in recent years, with mixed success. In one of the most high-profile cases, Germany\u2019s top court ruled last year that the government had to adjust its climate targets to avoid unduly burdening the young. The German government reacted by bringing forward its target for \u2018net zero\u2019 emissions by five years to 2045 and laying more ambitious near-and-medium term steps to achieve that goal.

{"id":null,"body":" Hot countries could see death rates skyrocket over the coming decades if the world doesn\u2019t limit future climate change Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile The impacts of the climate crisis will start to be deadlier than some widespread diseases like cancer as the planet continues to heat up, warns a new report from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Hotter temperatures will lead to more excess deaths, especially in parts of the world that already get very hot \u2013 likely making existing global inequalities even worse, the agency says . But the new data also shows that by limiting how much the planet warms, we still have time to mitigate some of the potential damage. \u201cConcerted global progress towards Paris Agreement targets could reduce projected mortality from extreme heat in 2100 by more than [80 per cent]\u201d the report says, \u201cpotentially saving tens of millions of lives over the next decades.\u201d In Bangladesh , about 67 out of 100,000 people died of cancer in 2019. But that number of deaths could be dwarfed if the world continues to pump greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a very high rate, the data shows. By the end of the century in a high-emissions scenario, more than 130 additional people per 100,000 would die every year in Dhaka, the country\u2019s capital and largest city. In Khulna, Bangladesh\u2019s third-largest city, that number rises to more than 200 additional deaths per 100,000 people every year. Higher temperatures could exacerbate deaths in many hot parts of the world, but some wealthier places could blunt the impact, the report says. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while the average annual temperature could get even hotter than Dhaka or Khulna, the city would see 120 excess deaths per 100,000 people by the end of the century. Additional deaths in parts of Bangladesh under a high emissions scenario compared to current death rates from cancer and road injuries In cooler parts of the world, death rates are actually expected to fall, according to this report. In Moscow, for example, rapid warming could lead to 130 fewer deaths per 100,000 people every year by the end of the century. The same goes for cooler parts of the US \u2013 while the death rate is likely to fall in Minneapolis, one of the coldest parts of the US, it\u2019s likely to rise significantly in San Antonio, one of the hottest. But worldwide, \u201cthe projected increase in death rates caused by warmer temperatures is estimated to be much larger than the projected decrease in deaths due to declines in cold days\u201d, the report says. Limiting future warming could lessen the death toll, the data show. In Dhaka, for example, a future with a more moderate level of greenhouse gas emissions would have about 100 fewer deaths per 100,000 people every year, compared to the high emissions scenario. And in Khulna, 150 lives per 100,000 people could be saved every year. Some experts now say that the high emissions scenario studied in these data is, thankfully, looking less and less likely as countries turn away from fossil fuels and expand renewable energy. But those predictions also assume that countries won\u2019t renege on any climate plans or actions in the coming decades. Even under the more moderate scenario, however, the report still found plenty of excess deaths. And along with the danger of hotter temperatures, the climate crisis will make extreme weather like droughts, storms, wildfires and floods more common, adding additional risk to human life. Climate scientists, politicians and policy experts from around the world will be meeting next week in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt for Cop27, the UN\u2019s annual climate change conference . While attendees will attempt to make progress on global agreements to limit warming, many nations are still falling short on pledges and goals toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The world is now on track to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, according to the independent analysts at the Climate Action Tracker \u2013 putting the planet on course for severe climate impacts over the next few decades.

{"id":null,"body":" Analysis: It might sound sexy but it\u2019s coming too late to solve our current set of crises, writes Harry Cockburn Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A researcher walks through the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Since the 1950s, the prospect of nuclear fusion has remained tantalisingly close, yet just out of reach. Fusion\u2019s promise \u2013 of a steady torrent of zero-carbon energy with no toxic waste \u2013 has seemingly remained just a couple of decades away, but has never quite come to fruition. Meanwhile, over the seven decades scientists have spent working to replicate the same process that powers the sun, our world has steadily entrenched its dependency on climate-altering fossil fuel combustion, which is now taking a devastating toll on the natural world and our own species. But could that be about to change more quickly than was thought possible? US scientists are believed to be on the verge of announcing a breakthrough in energy generation through nuclear fusion. According to reports, which are not yet backed up by published research, over the past two weeks, a process at the federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has achieved net energy gain through a process called \u201cinertial confinement fusion\u201d. The process involves using the world\u2019s biggest laser inside a gold-plated chamber to bombard a tiny quantity of hydrogen plasma, stripping the hydrogen atoms of their electrons. The superheating of these electron-free hydrogen nuclei causes them to fuse, releasing energy as it leaves the resulting bonded nuclei with less mass than before the reaction. If this occurs rapidly enough, the energy output from this process can exceed the heat energy put in through the lasers. This is known as \u201cignition\u201d. A formal statement is yet to be put out by the research team, but according to \u201ctwo people with knowledge of the results\u201d who spoke to the Financial Times , the energy output from the reactor was higher than the input, and was even greater than expected, causing some of the critical measuring equipment to be damaged and complicating the efforts of the team to analyse the reaction. Nonetheless, the US Department of Energy has said that energy secretary Jennifer Granholm will announce \u201ca major scientific breakthrough\u201d on Tuesday, prompting speculation that the world could be on the cusp of seeing genuine nuclear fusion. The long-held promise of nuclear fusion is that it could provide energy in such abundance that it would effectively replace all other forms of power, bringing free, unlimited energy to people around the world, revolutionising our societies, and helping to bring the emissions driving the climate crisis to heel. Scientists are now cautiously optimistic that we could be witnessing a major breakthrough with the potential to radically alter the energy landscape. Professor Sir Robin Grimes, of Imperial College London, said on Monday: \u201cThis is a key step on a possible pathway to commercial fusion. It demonstrates and underpins our basic understanding of the physics, and is an engineering triumph. \u201cNevertheless, extracting this energy in a way that it can be harnessed, and developing the materials that can stand up to continuous operation, are massive challenges. There is no doubt, the prize is worth the effort. Success, however long it takes, would be transformational.\u201d The professor\u2019s comments seem to indicate that despite the recent success, which should be applauded, viable power from fusion remains a considerable way off, and all the time, the emissions going into the atmosphere are continuing to rise. The risk posed by unguarded optimism about the prospect of unlimited free energy is that it could undo the small steps that have already been taken to decarbonise the energy sector and other industries that have largely depended on fossil fuels. Just as polluting industries are already factoring in scarcely adequate carbon capture technology in pursuit of their own net zero targets, fusion must not be treated as a climate crisis \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. The technology cannot be ready within the time window required to meet the climate targets governments are already failing to meet. Our society\u2019s priority must remain the rapid curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions. It may not be as sexy, but a combination of energy efficiency, insulation, heat pumps and a broader rollout of renewables remains our best shot for tackling the climate crisis and building greater energy security.

{"id":null,"body":" Whales, like all living things, are composed largely of carbon Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Whales could be important allies in the fight against climate change, scientists have discovered. Storing and capturing carbon dioxide (CO2), the most common of greenhouse gases, is a crucial part of curbing global heating. This process, called carbon sequestration, is typically talked about in relation to planting trees or restoring wetlands but less so with mammals. But researchers have found that some of the planet \u2019s largest mammals can potentially contribute to overall reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. Whales can weigh up to 150 tons and, like all living things, are composed largely of carbon. It makes them one of the largest living \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d. The ocean is an important carbon sink, absorbing around one-fifth of human-caused carbon emissions over the last decade. Blue whales, for example, eat around 8,000lbs of small crustaceans, krill, and photosynthetic plankton every day. In turn, whales\u2019 excrement is rich in nutrients that help tiny sea creatures to flourish, supprting photosynthesis and carbon storage, the scientists found. \u201cTheir size and longevity allow whales to exert strong effects on the carbon cycle by storing carbon more effectively than small animals, ingesting extreme quantities of prey, and producing large volumes of waste products,\u201d wrote the research team from the University of Alaska Southeast and the University of Otago. The new paper was published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. Whales can live for nearly a century and when they die, their bodies fall to the seafloor where carbon is transferred to the deep sea as they decay. This adds to the biological carbon pump, where nutrients and chemicals are exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere. The scientists say that protecting whale populations and helping increase their numbers is important in enhancing the ocean as a carbon sink. Commercial hunting has done untold damage to the biological carbon pump by decreasing whale populations by 81 per cent.

The poll of more than 1,200 global risk experts, policy-makers and industry leaders found that the global pandemic and war in Europe have thrust fears over soaring energy and food costs to the fore. Climate and human development must be at the core of concerns of global leaders, even as they battle current crises. Cooperation is the only way forward This crisis has sparked follow-on risks that will dominate the next two years \u2013 such as the risk of recession, growing debt distress, ongoing inflation pressures and delays on taking rapid action on climate change. Geo-economic confrontation and the erosion of social cohesion and polarised societies, made worse by disinformation and misinformation, rank in second and fifth place in the top 10 short-term risks. But the analysis by the WEF \u2013 compiled with Marsh McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group \u2013 showed a different picture over the long-term, with the failure to act on global warming and to adapt to climate change as the two biggest global risks over the next 10 years. In fact, climate change and environmental related concerns account for four of the top five risks over the 10-year horizon and the WEF said the findings shows the window for action is \u201cclosing rapidly and concerted, collective action is needed before risks reach a tipping point\u201d. Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the WEF, said: \u201cThe short-term risk landscape is dominated by energy, food, debt and disasters. \u201cThose that are already the most vulnerable are suffering \u2013 and in the face of multiple crises, those who qualify as vulnerable are rapidly expanding, in rich and poor countries alike.\u201d She added: \u201c Climate and human development must be at the core of concerns of global leaders, even as they battle current crises. Cooperation is the only way forward.\u201d Carolina Klint, risk management leader of Continental Europe for Marsh, cautioned that the mounting economic pressures will hamper efforts to address risks. She said: \u201cAt a time when countries and organisations should be stepping up resilience efforts, economic headwinds will constrain their ability to do so. \u201cFaced with the most difficult geo-economic conditions in a generation, companies should focus not just on navigating near-term concerns but also on developing strategies that will position them well for longer-term risks and structural change.\u201d The WEF, which is holding its annual Davos conference next week, said its study showed experts fear that the efforts to tackle the cost of living crisis, energy supply and other immediate threats \u201crisk undermining efforts to tackle longer-term risks, notably those related to climate change, biodiversity and investment in human capital\u201d, according to the study. The report urges world leaders to \u201cact collectively and decisively\u201d and warns against so-called resource rivalry, which could impact the supply of and demand for natural resources including food, water and energy. It also called on countries to work together to \u201cstrengthen financial stability, technology governance, economic development and investment in research, science, education and health\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":" ExxonMobil knew \u2018as much as academic and government scientists knew,\u2019 study finds Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Related video: EU Climate Data Reveals World Is Getting Hotter Fast as Europe Had Second Warmest Summer In Recorded History ExxonMobil scientists had accurately predicted global warming due to human-induced emissions since the 1970s even as the oil giant lobbied and launched campaigns to delay climate action , according to a new study. For decades, several fossil fuel companies have tried to convince people that a causal link between fossil fuel use and global warming cannot be made, arguing that the climate models used to project Earth\u2019s temperature changes are uncertain. The new research, published in the journal Science on Friday , conducted the first ever systematic assessment of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s internal climate projections. Scientists, including those from Harvard University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in the US, assessed the accuracy of global warming projections reported by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003, based on never-before reported data buried in the Oil Giant\u2019s internal documents. Researchers found that most of the company\u2019s projections accurately forecast warming consistent with subsequent observations and their predictions were also \u201cconsistent\u201d with, \u201cand at least as skillful as\u201d, those of independent academic and government models. The findings suggest that what oil companies understood about climate models internally contradicted what they led the public to believe. \u201cOur findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn\u2019t just know \u2018something\u2019 about global warming decades ago \u2013 they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew,\u201d researchers wrote in the study. ExxonMobil, the study reports, worked to deny the findings of its own scientists, by following strategies like denigrating climate models, overemphasising uncertainties in the analyses, mythologising global cooling, and claiming ignorance about the possibility of estimating human-caused warming. About 60 to 80 per cent of global warming projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were consistent with subsequently observed temperatures, according to the study. But in 2004, for instance, the company said \u201cscientific uncertainties continue to limit our ability to make objective, quantitative determinations regarding the human role in recent climate change\u201d, contrary to the findings of its own scientists. \u201cExxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the \u2018carbon budget\u2019 for holding warming below 2\u00b0C,\u201d scientists wrote in the study. However, on each of these points the company\u2019s own public statements about climate science \u201ccontradicted its own scientific data,\u201d researchers say. \u201cThese findings corroborate and add quantitative precision to assertions by scholars, journalists, lawyers, politicians, and others that ExxonMobil accurately foresaw the threat of human-caused global warming, both prior and parallel to orchestrating lobbying and propaganda campaigns to delay climate action,\u201d they added. The latest report also refutes claims by the oil giant and its defenders that these assertions are incorrect. \u201cOur analysis shows that ExxonMobil\u2019s own data contradicted its public statements, which included exaggerating uncertainties, criticizing climate models, mythologising global cooling, and feigning ignorance about when \u2013 or if \u2013 human-caused global warming would be measurable, all while staying silent on the threat of stranded fossil fuel assets,\u201d study lead author Geoffrey Supran said. \u201cThis is the nail-in-the-coffin of ExxonMobil\u2019s claims that it has been falsely accused of climate malfeasance,\u201d he added. \u201cThis issue has come up several times in recent years and, in each case, our answer is the same: those who talk about how \u2018Exxon Knew\u2019 are wrong in their conclusions,\u201d the company told BBC.

{"id":null,"body":" Shifting protest tactics, scrutiny for green-washers and cheaper electric vehicles are coming down the pike this year. Louise Boyle reports Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Clockwise from top left: The inauguration of Brazil\u2019s new leader \u2018Lula\u2019; children being taken to safety during Pakistan\u2019s floods, an Extinction Rebellion protester removed by police and a prototype of a new electric vehicle. What will 2023 have in store for the climate crisis? 2022 was a year of peaks and troughs in the climate fight. To name a few: The year marked the highest level of fossil fuel-driven carbon emissions in history ( extreme low ) but also groundbreaking US climate legislation and milestone global agreements on climate compensation and reversing destruction of nature ( highs! ) What does 2023 have in store? Here\u2019s some big moments to look out for. Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine unexpectedly led to massive gains in the clean energy sector last year, and it is set to continue. According to the influentional International Energy Agency (IEA), the world will add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the past two decades. The IEA\u2019s latest assessment found that renewables are expected to make up over 90 per cent of global electricity expansion over the next five years, overtaking coal to become the largest source of electricity in just two years\u2019 time. It\u2019s not the only clean tech that will further ramp up this year. Boom times will continue in electric vehicle (EV) sales even amid turbulent waters at Tesla and a lag in charging stations rollout. EV sales doubled in 2021 to 6.6 million, IEA reported , and despite supply chain snarls in 2022, sales steadily rose. The trend will continue this year with the number of EVs on the road expected to be 20.6 million in 2025, according to BloombergNEF . Stumbling blocks like the rising cost of batteries won\u2019t halt the upwards trajectory, Bloomberg noted, particularly as gasoline and diesel vehicles become more expensive to make. 2023 will also see new models of EVs at more affordable prices, TechCrunch reported. The charging network is already struggling to keep up with demand. In the US alone, EV charging stations must increase eight-fold by 2030, auto-industry site CBT News recently reported. Police officers carry an Extinction Rebellion activist during a series of actions in central London. in August 2021 . The group said it would shift tactics in early 2023 The climate activist movement, Extinction Rebellion (XR), announced on 1 January that in the UK it would temporarily shift away from using public disruption to draw attention to the climate crisis. The change was \u201cvery much\u201d in response to public backlash over XR\u2019s tactics, spokesperson Marijn van de Geer acknowledged, which have included blocking roads, sit-ins and mass arrests. XR also pointed out that increasing numbers of people want governments to do more to tackle the climate crisis. So, the activists have launched a new 100-day campaign that will culminate in a protest dubbed \u201cThe Big One\u201d outside UK Parliament buildings on 21st April that they hope will attract 100,000 people. \u201cXR is committed to including everyone in this work and leaving no one behind, because everyone has a role to play. This year, we prioritise attendance over arrest and relationships over roadblocks, as we stand together and become impossible to ignore,\u201d the group said in a statement. Fellow protest groups, Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain, have pledged to continuing acts of civil resistance. \u201cIt\u2019s 2023 and XR has quit,\u201d Just Stop Oil told The Independent in a statement, aligning their climate protest strategy with NHS workers\u2019 strikes in recent weeks. \u201cThere is no impunity from the coming storm, no free pass for the public. Ordinary people will be left to face it first, not knowing if they should stay in their homes or if they leave where they can go. No one is coming to save us - we must continue resisting a harmful, criminal government.\u201d Another activist group, Insulate Britain, also voiced support for the UK\u2019s striking nurses, ambulance drivers and railway workers and said its supporters remain committed to civil resistance as \u201cthe only appropriate and effective response to the reality of our situation in 2023\u201d. \u201cSupporters of Insulate Britain are prepared to continue to risk being sent to prison, with 13 supporters still in prison over Christmas, because they understand that this is what it will take to divert our government away from its current death project of new oil and gas, and cold and leaky homes,\u201d read a statement, emailed to The Independent. \u201cThousands of everyday people in civil resistance on motorways, roads and critical national infrastructure is what is needed right now because it gets results.\u201d Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, universally known as Lula, was inaugurated as Brazil\u2019s president for the third time on New Year\u2019s Day and immediately announced plans to end illegal deforestation in the waning Amazon. The rainforest is a natural buffer against the climate crisis by absorbing vast amounts of planet-heating carbon dioxide. However as the dense forest is slashed and burned, scientists have warned that the Amazon is dangerously near a tipping point to become a net carbon emitter. Among his first acts as president, Lula reestablished an Amazon fund for sustainable development in the rainforest. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, \u2018Lula\u2019, and his newly-named Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara He has also appointed several key cabinet members to bolster his mission. Longtime environmentalist, Marina Silva, from the Amazonian state of Acre, was named environment minister. She previously held the position in Lula\u2019s administration and spurred a huge decline in deforestation. S\u00f4nia Guajajara, leader of the main umbrella group for Brazil\u2019s many Indigenous tribes, made history as the first ever head of a new Ministry of Indigenous People. The majority of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous territories are located in the Amazon and the communities are frontline defenders of the forest and its rich biodiversity. They have been killed in increasing numbers amid invasions of their lands for illegal logging, ranching and mining. \u201cThis is more than a personal achievement,\u201d Guajajara said. \u201cIt is a collective achievement of the Indigenous peoples, a historic moment of reparation in Brazil.\u201d The most significant climate law in US history will be implemented this year. Officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, it will funnel $370billion into decarbonizing every corner of the American economy from electric vehicles (EV) to wind farms and battery storage at the national and statewide level. The legislation also has the potential to make an impact from house to house as it includes measures to help Americans cover the costs of home improvements from installing solar panels and heat pumps to insulation and adding EV chargers. It is expected to have a ripple effect globally, according to strategists Wood Mackenzie, as other countries will introduce incentives to keep up with what\u2019s on offer in the US. \u201cThat will be a net gain for the world, not a zero-sum game: a levelling-up of policy support will unlock new business opportunities for the entire globe,\u201d a recent forecast noted. However, expect some bumps in the road. The New York Times reported in October that oil and gas industry lobbyists were making the rounds on Capitol Hill to undermine the IRA\u2019s anti-fossil-fuel agenda among sympathetic lawmakers. One reported strategy is to hollow out a $4.5bn program to would help low-income households replace gas appliances with electric ones. 2023 is the year of the United Nations\u2019 \u201cGlobal Stocktake,\u201d a key part of the Paris Agreement that will be a de-facto report card on countries\u2019 progress in cutting emissions, and provide a launchpad for plans to carry through this consequential decade. (Global emissions need to be cut roughly in half in the next seven years to stick to the 1.5C temperature limit - a target which is currently way, way off track). UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres suggested that he will be taking no prisoners at the stocktake in September. \u201c There is a price of entry and the price of entry is non-negotiable \u2014 credible, serious and new climate action. It will be a no-nonsense summit. No exceptions. No compromises. There will be no room for back-sliders, greenwashers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years,\u201d he said. Separately, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to release new rules in 2023 (when exactly has yet to be announced) requiring public companies to report carbon footprints and climate risks. It will bring some much-needed transparency into who, and what, is behind the planet\u2019s still-rising emissions tally. A major focus of the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt this past November was how the global financial architecture unfairly burdens developing and poor countries with high levels of debt when they request funds to recover from extreme weather events. Not only does it leaving these nations struggling to make repayments, but prevents their investment in long-term plans and infrastructure that would help ward off future crises. One of the most vocal advocates for overhauling the global financial system is Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, whose \u201cBridgetown agenda\u201d lays out a framework on how it could be done. The plan will be presented by Barbados at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in April in Washington DC. The plan has already gained traction with leaders of some wealthy countries notably France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, who will also host a June summit with PM Mottley on the issue .

{"id":null,"body":" Some Arctic communities have started patrols to keep watch for wandering polar bears. Graig Graziosi  reports Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile A polar bear on Svalbard T he climate crisis isn\u2019t only taking a devastating toll on humanity with a carousel of increasingly extreme events. It\u2019s also greatly harming the planet\u2019s biodiversity. On Tuesday, reports emerged that a polar bear had killed a woman and a child in a small village in western Alaska. While it\u2019s unclear if the attack was a direct result of the climate crisis, changing conditions have forced the bears into more \u2014 and sometimes fatal \u2014 encounters with humans. \u201cInitial reports indicate that a polar bear had entered the community and had chased multiple residents,\u201d Alaska state troopers wrote in a dispatch report about the attack. \u201cThe bear fatally attacked an adult female and juvenile male.\u201d A local resident ultimately shot and killed the bear. The World Wildlife Fund issued a statement to The Independent following the attack. \u201cWWF is deeply saddened to hear that a woman and a boy were killed by a polar bear in the community of Wales, a predominantly Inupiaq village of 145 people located on the far western edge of the Seward Peninsula adjacent to the Bering Strait,\u201d the organisation said. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and members of the community\u202fas they deal with this tragedy.\u202f We are focused on giving the community privacy and space to grieve. We are ready to listen to the community when they are ready and discuss the support we can offer.\u201d Being Arctic dwellers, the bears live in a region that is heating at four times the rate of the rest of the world, as reported by NASA scientist Peter Jacobs. Rising ocean temperatures are melting sea ice and reducing their hunting grounds. Somewhere between 21,000-30,000 polar bears are now left in the wild, but estimating whether there is a decline in adult population numbers is tricky due to a lack of long-term data. However, recent aerial counts of polar bear cubs between the ages of one and two-years-old have shown a dramatic decrease in bears reaching adulthood since the 1990s. Those cubs, called \u201cyearlings\u201d, used to account for 12 per cent of the polar bear population. Now, they only account for three percent. News stories have focused on depressing images of emaciated polar bears stranded on ice flows and the increased \u2013 though still rare \u2013 numbers of aggressive encounters between the generally reclusive polar bears and humans. In August, a polar bear attacked three people when they stumbled on it feeding on a carcass near their cabin in Sanirajak, Nunavut, Canada. All three survived the attack but suffered serious injuries as a result, according to the CBC . In another incident in August, helicopters were called in to scare off seven polar bears that were stalking a captive herd of reindeer in Siberia. The bears were reportedly acting aggressively towards the reindeer and their human keepers, likely because they were hungry. In 2014, children in the village of Arviat in the Canadian Arctic, congregated inside a community building in their Halloween costumes because a trio of polar bears were sniffing around outside looking for food. Despite these reports, top polar bear researchers caution against focusing on these incidents. They note that it\u2019s the conditions \u2013 not the bears \u2013 that have changed. \"I think it's important to differentiate between a behavioral change, as we would commonly think of it, and think of it more in the framework of something the bears are forced into because their habitat is gone,\" Dr Steven Amstrup, the chief scientist at Polar Bear International (PBI), told The Independent . Dr Amstrup has been researching polar bears for the non-profit since 2010. Before joining PBI, he spent 30 years at the US Geological Survey working in Alaska\u2019s Beaufort Sea researching the bears, and has served as a chair on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s Polar Bear Specialist Group. He said that climate change-driven sea ice melt is the predominant threat to the global polar bear population. According to NOAA\u2019s 2021 Arctic report card, the region experienced its warmest autumn since records began in 1900. Post-winter sea ice levels were at their lowest since NOAA began keeping track a decade ago. These changes are devastating polar bear hunting grounds. Polar bear seen on camera drowning a reindeer for the first time as the climate crisis impacts their natural habitat and feeding patterns Polar bears predominantly eat two species of Arctic seals \u2013 bearded and ring. The seals use snow that falls on the sea ice to build dens for when they give birth. When seal pups venture onto the ice, they, and the adults, make up most of polar bears' caloric intake. Less sea ice, and there\u2019s fewer places for seals to build birthing dens. In turn, there are fewer opportunities for polar bears to feed. Ice is also freezing later in the year than in the past, meaning that the snow dissolves in ocean water rather than accumulating. With fewer seals to feed on, polar bears have been forced to expand their hunting grounds and find new sources of food. Reports from The Royal Society Open Science journal found that polar bears are more frequently visiting the nesting locations of birds, like eider, and eating them and their eggs. This change in polar bears\u2019 hunting methods not only threatens these species of Arctic ground bear, but provides insufficient caloric replacement. Seals are like \u201cfat pills\u201d for the bears, according to Dr Amstrup. Feeding on birds and eggs cannot fully replace the energy needed for polar bears to survive and procreate. While some reports out of Russia have suggested that polar bears are turning to cannibalism, Dr Amstrup said those incidents are rare, noting that all kinds of bears kill other bears. It usually happens among adult males and cubs to free up nursing females for breeding. More troubling are reports of bears more frequently visiting human settlements. While the Arctic is sometimes thought of as a barren wasteland of snow and ice, it is actually home to more than 21,000 known species of animals, plants, fungi and microbe species , as well as four million humans. Dr Amstrup said polar bears have been scavenging bowhead whale remains left by the I\u00f1upiat people, who are native to Alaska, creating both risks for the Indigenous community and the bears. In other regions, polar bears are attacking captive reindeer herds. To protect both people and bears, PBI and WWF have been working on mitigation efforts. PBI is experimenting with ground-based radar, a technology generally used by the military, to detect a bear's approach. The technology would allow people to scare off the creature before it reaches a human settlement. WWF is organising community-based bear patrols which respond to bear threats non-lethally. The lack of sufficient food sources for polar bears also means fewer bear cubs reaching adulthood. While bears are still mating at the same rates, fewer of the cubs are making it the stage known as a \u201cyearling\u201d. \u201cMany people don't quite appreciate when biologists say that the survival of cubs is not as good as it used to be, what they're really saying is \u2013 it's a euphemism that means more polar bear cubs are starving to death,\u201d Dr Amstrup said. There are some scattered reports of polar bear inbreeding, which can result in an emergence of recessive traits and the narrowing of genetic diversity in populations. There have also been some observations of polar bears mating with grizzly bears and producing hybrid offspring. Notably, these cases are rare. A hybrid bear may ensure some elements of polar bear survives the decline of the Arctic, but researchers like Dr Amstrup are not content to make do with this scenario. \u201cIf we allow the world to continue to warm to a point where polar bears have totally disappeared, there may be a few polar bear genes in something that looks like a grizzly bear. That's not really a very satisfying outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cMore importantly though, polar bears are more likely to starve out before there's any chance that they could be bred out of existence.\u201d Some studies project that the polar bear may become extinct by 2100. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has included the bears on its \u201cred list\u201d of threatened species, warning of a possible 30 per cent population decline over the next 35 years. Those projections aside, Dr Amstrup and Mr Downie remain hopeful, arguing that saving polar bears is completely within human control. \u201cFrom the standpoint of the greenhouse gas emissions pathway society is on, polar bears don't look like they're going to make it. But we have control over that,\u201d Dr Amstrup said. \u201cSo if we halt warming in time, we can save the polar bears. And oh, by the way, if we do that, it will benefit the rest of life on Earth as we know it, including ourselves.\u201d This article was amended on January 19 2023 to update a quote from the WWF Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Polar bear seen on camera drowning a reindeer for the first time as the climate crisis impacts their natural habitat and feeding patterns ArcticToday A polar bear on Svalbard Getty Images\/Andrew Peacock Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Her last posts on Facebook revealed how she had decided to turn around because of deteriorating conditions on the mountain. \u201cOur mother was a kind, loving, lively soul,\u201d her daughters said in a statement. \u201cShe had a thirst for adventure that she instilled in all of us during our childhood. She inspired those that met her on the trails. She loved life and life loved her back.\u201d Another experienced hiker, Bob Gregory, 61, has been missing since last Friday on Mount Islip in the San Gabriel range. Julian Sands has been missing in the San Gabriel mountain range for nearly a week Mr Gregory had shared a trail map of his planned route but rescue teams have been unable to locate him. Deep snow has impeded ground missions and limited rescuers to aerial searches over the massive snow drifts. \"My worst fear is that you know accidents, accidents happen,\" his son, Jimmy Gregory, told local TV station KCAL . \"He probably slipped. He probably went off the wrong trail. Or even the weather right now \u2013 weather is, really, a big factor right now.\" In early January, one missing hiker, 63-year-old Jeffrey Morton was found dead in southern California\u2019s Carbon Canyon Regional Park after failing to return from a pre-dawn hike. Officials said poor weather in the area had hampered their ability to use helicopters in the search. Such dangerous conditions will only worsen due to the climate crisis, Joe Biden said on Thursday, as he visited California to assess the damage from the severe storms. \u201cIf anybody doubts climate is changing, they must have been asleep for the last couple of years,\u201d Mr Biden said . \u201cExtreme weather caused by climate change means stronger and more frequent storms, more intense drought, longer wildfire seasons, all of which threatens communities across California.\u201d The recent storms that have swamped California are called \u201catmospheric river s \u201d \u2013 bands of water vapour that form over the ocean and can be hundreds of kilometres wide. When these atmospheric rivers hit the heights of mountain ranges, the water vapour becomes heavy snowfall. Atmospheric rivers increase the risks of flash flooding and rock slides as California has witnessed across the state in recent weeks. And the problem is worsening due to the climate crisis , scientists have warned. As the air heats up, it becomes capable of holding more water and leads to more rainfall. Organisations like the American Hiking Society (AHS) have warned about the impacts of the climate crisis on outdoor pursuits. \u201cWorld renowned trails like the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) , have been forced to close sections due to fires, drought conditions leave hikers without water sources, and views are obstructed and health impacted by smoke,\u201d the AHS said. \u201cImpacts like extreme heat, flooding, and other exacerbated weather events are being felt around the world.\u201d And it\u2019s not just during winter rain storms. Extreme heatwaves and wildfires, both exacerbated by the climate crisis, have led to the temporary closure of hundreds of kilometres of the Pacific Crest Trail, one of the US\u2019s most treasured hiking trails which begins at the Mexica border and runs 4,264km (2,650 miles) through California, Oregon, and Washington to Canada. \u201cWe see a lot of people altering their trip plans because of smoke, because of fire impacts,\u201d Jennifer Tripp, trail operations manager for the PCT, told local TV station KCRA . Last autumn, extreme heat was blamed for several hikers\u2019 deaths in California and Arizona .

{"id":null,"body":" It is time to think about providing direct cash assistance to help people in poverty Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile Find your bookmarks in your  Independent Premium  section, under my profile It has been six months since flooding drove 33 million people in Pakistan from their homes and submerged a third of the country. Today, 8.6 million people \u2013 far greater than the population of Scotland \u2013 are still facing hunger. The poorest people are facing the catastrophic impacts of the human-created climate crisis, even when they are least responsible for the emissions. The 20 countries identified by the International Rescue Committee at the greatest risk of humanitarian disaster in 2023 contribute less than 2 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. A report by 55 vulnerable countries at Cop27 estimated their combined climate-linked losses over the past 20 years at $525 billion. On the anniversary of Pakistan\u2019s devastating floods , we should ask: how can we more effectively help those bearing the brunt of climate crisis disasters worldwide? There\u2019s one word that can help: money. It is time to think about providing direct cash assistance to help people in poverty adapt to the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Whether in a rapid disaster like a hurricane, or a protracted crisis like a drought, families need cash to meet their immediate needs \u2013 such as food or water \u2013 and to rebuild for the long term. There are three key ways in which direct cash is key to surviving and rebuilding in the face of climate catastrophe. The first is immediate recovery. Cash transfers reach families quickly and allow them to determine their own changing needs in a disaster- as opposed to receiving pre-determined aid or donated goods they are forced to sell or leave behind. Giving survivors cash directly and unconditionally allows them to both meet their short-term needs and rebuild their homes and businesses in the long-term. In the face of recurring climate shocks, like the historic drought gripping East Africa, families need cash to address food shortfalls, urgent medical needs, or source water while building resilience to future shocks. Another example is Pakistan \u2013 since the floods started in July 2022, the IRC has been providing lifesaving services since early July to flood-affected communities and has now scaled up its emergency response to almost 1 million people. Second, cash payments outside of emergencies improve resilience to shock. Poverty and cyclical shocks prevent individuals from building resilience; targeted payments encourage development during more stable periods. Take Namasoopo, a grandmother in the mountainous eastern Uganda. Three years ago, rains caused a landslide in the middle of the night, killing half of her family. Today, she is raising her surviving grandchildren but has been unable to afford to move to a safer area. Now she\u2019s receiving cash aid from GiveDirectly and says, \u201cI plan to use the funds to get a safer place away from the disasters, construct a better house, and purchase two goats.\u201d An academic study found a year after these payments, families had improved monthly earnings by 71 per cent and made lasting farming investments. Cash gives people \u2013 and women in particular \u2013 the power to make choices for themselves and cycle the money through local markets and local communities. Third, and most significantly, cash transfers assist families before predictable disasters strike. Early warning systems that predict drought, hurricanes and floods can be paired with early action systems that trigger cash transfers as soon as a crisis is detected \u2013 often helping prevent the worst impacts on individuals altogether. When comparing families in Bangladesh who received cash aid days before a 2020 flood to those who did not, researchers found they were 12 per cent more likely to evacuate and 36 per cent less likely to go hungry. Months later, they were in better shape financially and mentally. Despite the evidence, far too little cash relief is reaching families already living the reality of extreme weather. The historic \u201closs and damage\u201d fund agreed at Cop27 is an important gesture in advancing climate justice for poorer nations, but it will not be meaningful if it follows in the desultory footsteps of the unfulfilled $100 billion pledge for climate financing made in 2009. Less than a quarter of that pledge is reaching developing countries for adaptation, with as little as less than 1 per cent delivered as cash. A more appropriate target called for by the United Nations is 50 per cent of all climate finance to adaptation . This would help scale the use of cash in supporting people to adapt to climate change. For millions of the world\u2019s poorest and crisis-affected individuals, extreme weather is today\u2019s, not tomorrow\u2019s, problem. The future depends on urgent, clear and practical steps for prioritising adaptation, not merely acts of charity. Direct cash aid, whether before, during or after an emergency, is a tool for the most vulnerable to effectively adapt, survive and rebuild in the face of a climate crisis they did the least to create. Now is the time to surge on cash support in the climate crisis, lest we deprive those bearing the brunt of climate change of the tools to survive it.
