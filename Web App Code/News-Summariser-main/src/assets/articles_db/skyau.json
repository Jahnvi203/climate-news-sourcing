{"id":null,"body":"A former UK Extinction Rebellion activist has rejected the idea that renewables are the only way towards emissions reduction and has hit out at \u201cboomer\u201d environmentalists for demonising nuclear energy. Former UK Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman Zion Lights says climate change would not exist if \u201cboomer\u201d environmentalists had not \u201cfailed us\u201d and embraced nuclear energy decades ago. Ms Lights has become a key voice in support of nuclear energy after leaving Extinction Rebellion in 2020, arguing that the group \u201clost their way\u201d. Extinction Rebellion has gained infamy across the world since its formation in 2018 with activists gluing themselves to city streets and destroying public property in the name of climate change. \u201cIt's no good just telling people all the time that things are bad and this is a bad thing that's happening, and you should just feel bad,\u201d Ms Lights told Sky News Australia\u2019s Chris Kenny. \u201cThat's actually a really bad motivator for change anyway, so I think that they've lost their way a little bit, and that was part of my departure from that group.\u201d Ms Lights\u2019 exit from the controversial group came amid a global push for greater action on climate change after President Joe Biden\u2019s election in 2020. World leaders are due to meet in Glasgow in early November to discuss plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050 in a bid to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees on pre-industrial levels. Ms Lights said reducing emissions and maintaining a sustainable global energy supply cannot be done \u201cwith renewable energy alone\u201d. \u201cA key part of protecting the natural environment for my children is nuclear energy, that is just a fact,\u201d she said. She said there was a growing push to adopt nuclear power by younger climate activists who were \u201copen to any solution\u201d rather than the \u201colder boomer generation of environmentalists\u201d. \u201cFrankly, those environmentalists have failed us. If we had embraced nuclear technology decades ago, we would not have climate change. \u201cWe need to start building, and this kind of goes against what traditionally environmentalism kind of stands for. But it\u2019s the only solution. If you\u2019re building huge solar farms with huge wind turbines, that\u2019s still building. So, I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s okay, and that\u2019s seen as green but nuclear energy isn\u2019t.\u201d Nuclear power has long been tarnished by concerns over safety partly due to memories of disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima as well as Cold War sentiments around nuclear weapons. Ms Lights said people in the environmental movement had for a long-time \u201cconfused energy with weapon\u201d. \u201cThe environmental movement was kind of borne around that time, out of the Cold War era, lot of worry about weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who have lived through that are some of the most prominent, vocal environmentalists. So, they just hear nuclear and they just shut down, they just think of bombs. \u201cOnce that fear is there it\u2019s very hard to get rid of it, it\u2019s very hard to unpick that.\u201d Ms Light\u2019s support for nuclear power comes amid growing support within the Coalition government to pursue the baseload alternative to renewables. Five Nationals MPs were at the centre of a push in February to give the Clean Energy Finance Corporation the weight of $1 billion to invest in nuclear generators as well carbon capture and storage technologies. But a moratorium on a domestic nuclear industry introduced during the Howard government has prevented any development in that space despite Australia\u2019s large uranium deposits. Ms Lights said Australia\u2019s refusal to develop nuclear power surprised her and did not \u201cmake sense\u201d. \u201cYou (Australia) could have abundant energy and energy independence, and not rely on anybody, and you could be a world leader in showing how things are done,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you really want to stick it to the boomer environmentalists that are telling us all to live with less, you could show them how you can create a decarbonized future that still gives everybody abundant energy, high quality of life, but just isn't causing climate change. \u201cYou've got loads of space as well, you've got more space than we have, so I do find it baffling and I'm not sure why that is over there.\u201d Zion Lights discusses the potential of nuclear power in an  exclusive Sky News Australia documentary 'Going Nuclear: the Clean Energy Debate' , on Monday 25 October at 8pm AEDT.

Mr Turnbull wrote six days ago that the deadly bushfires were proof the \u201cwicked, self-destructive idiocy of climate denialism must stop\u201d. \u201cEven as the fires rage, Murdoch\u2019s News Corp newspapers and television networks have been busy arguing that arsonists or a lack of controlled burning are the real causes of the fires,\u201d he wrote. Oh Malcom, how times have changed since you were Prime Minister. It is almost as if you overlooked your response to the horror bushfire which tore through Tathra, wiping out 69 homes in 2018. Greens Senator Richard Di Natale complained in the aftermath that a lack of renewable investment had contributed to the bushfire season become more dangerous. And how did Mr Turnbull respond to those comments? \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Greens would try to politicise an event like this,\u201d he said during a televised press conference at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t attribute any particular event, whether it\u2019s a flood or fire or a drought or a storm, to climate change. \u201cBut clearly this is an environment, we have an environment, which has extremes. Bushfires are part of Australia, as indeed are droughts and floods.\u201d Malcolm Turnbull stated as a fact that you could not blame the bushfire in 2018 on climate change.  Then two years later he wrote an article claiming that comments similar to his own were the fault of the evil Murdoch family. How pathetic. How opportunistic. But Mr Turnbull was not done attempting to re-write history. \u201cAs Prime Minister, I tried to ensure that our climate and energy policies were governed by engineering and economics, not ideology and idiocy,\u201d he said in the recent Time Magazine article. \u201cTragically, the climate-denying political right in Australia has turned what should be a practical question of how to respond to a real physical threat into a matter of values or belief.\u201d Mr Turnbull has even gone as far as to call for Australia to adopt a version of the US Green New Deal, championed by the insufferable elitist group of radical Democrats who have been dubbed \u201cThe Squad\u201d. \u201cAustralians no longer need to sacrifice economic growth to reduce emissions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must not waste this climate crisis. There are no excuses and not much time left. Australia and the world need a Green New Deal now.\u201d If only we had a leader, between say 2015 and 2018, who could have pushed for that deal. Perhaps then there would be no fires.

A global climate change report has outlined the ongoing effects of climate change declaring rapid emissions reduction is required to avoid irreversible damage. The International Panel on Climate Change released its sixth assessment report on Monday, three months ahead of the Glasgow 2021 Climate Change Conference. The report outlines how climate change is \u201cunequivocally\u201d being caused by humans and that the 1.5C warming threshold would be reached by 2040. More than 14,000 international scientific studies contributed to the report which warned once the world surpassed the 1.5C threshold, catastrophic weather events due to runaway climate change would occur. The IPCC report is the starkest reminder yet that the climate crisis is here right now and is the biggest long term threat we face. Scientists warned that every increase in global temperature of 0.5C would severely affect the size and frequency of heavy rainfalls, heat extremes and droughts. The panel also spelled out dire consequences for Australia which has reportedly warmed by 1.4C in comparison to the global average of 1.1C. Australia\u2019s fire season, along with the amount of extreme fire days, has increased since the mid-20th century, and will continue to surge, according to the report. \u201cThe intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia (high confidence) and New Zealand (medium confidence),\u201d says the report. Along with a lengthened fire season, climate change in Australia\u00a0 has resulted in higher rising sea levels than the global average, less winter rainfall in southern Australia and a decrease in snow cover. But the report warned heavier coastal and river flooding, increased fire season intensity and longer bushfires will get worse under increased global temperatures. Australia\u2019s Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said Australia was meeting its climate change targets and was leading the world in renewable energy uptake. \u201cOvercoming these challenges is a shared responsibility,\u201d Mr Taylor declared. \u201cSince 2018, Australia\u2019s 2030 position has improved by 639 million tonnes (equivalent to taking all of Australia\u2019s 14.7 million cars off the road for 15 years). \u201cThese improvements are driven by Australian households and businesses adopting new energy technologies at record rates.\u201d Australia has more solar uptake per person than any country in the world, and the most wind and solar outside of Europe. Residential solar panels in Australia outstrip the rest of the world. Mr Taylor said Australia\u2019s investment in renewable technology was driving its emissions reduction effort. \u201cThe Government\u2019s Technology Investment Roadmap is positioning Australia to be a leader in the next generation of low-emissions technologies that will make net zero emissions practically achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to emissions reduction, our record is one of delivery and achievement that Australians can be proud of.\u00a0 \u201cOur technology-led approach to reducing emissions will see Australia continue to play its part in the global effort to combat climate change without compromising our economy or jobs.\u201d Leading Australian climate experts though painted a grim picture, a picture highlighted by the IPCC report. ANU\u2019s Professor Mark Howden, who serves as the Vice Chair of the IPCC and was a contributing author, said the report was yet another \u201cclear and loud alarm bell\u201d. \u201cThe evidence that these activities are already affecting climate across the globe and in every continent, region and ocean is now unequivocal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start to reduce our emissions significantly before 2050, the world is extremely likely to exceed 2 degrees Celsius of warming during the 21st century.\u201d Atmospheric Science professor at Murdoch University Dr Jatin Kala said it was up to individual nations to lead the emissions reduction effort. \u201cThe biggest source of un-certainty is what we do as individual nations, and as a global collective,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has never been a better time for bold, courageous policy implementation to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cAnd yes, we can do so, while still prospering.\" Our Apps","headline":"Australia 1.4c warmer declares global climate report","article_name":"7ffc35721e95308e1d09804d686e363c","article_url":"https:\/\/www.skynews.com.au\/australia-news\/politics\/overcoming-climate-change-a-shared-responsibility-says-energy-minister-amid-ipcc-report\/news-story\/7ffc35721e95308e1d09804d686e363c","date_published":"2021-08-09 11:13:38","article_length":4344,"date_uploaded":"2022-04-18T06:39:09.147421","article_start_url":null,"source":"skyau"}

{"id":null,"body":"The opposition leader has slammed Scott Morrison's climate change targets and questioned how Australians can trust him following his previous comments on electric vehicles. The opposition leader has slammed Scott Morrison\u2019s climate change targets following the ending of the COP26 conference. Anthony Albanese said Australia\u2019s report card from the conference was a \u201cdefinite fail\u201d after it was agreed that nations like Australia should return to the next conference with an improved target. \u201cIf the Australian government has signed up to an increased target for 2022, they need to tell the Australian people before the next election what that target is,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. The opposition leader also took aim at the Prime Minister for being \u201cmore spin rather than substance\u201d and \u201call things to all people\u201d. The Morrison government took a net zero by 2050 target to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow but it refused to change the 2030 climate target which is to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels. Mr Albanese questioned the government\u2019s modelling \u2013 which expects a huge uptake in electric vehicles \u2013 after Mr Morrison\u2019s previous comments on the new-age cars. \u201cIt predicts a 90 per cent electric vehicle take-up by 2050, now this is the same guy who said that electric vehicles would end the weekend, so is he saying \u2018we won\u2019t have weekends in Australia?\u2019 in 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cThen he denies that he\u2019s ever ridiculed electric vehicles when he\u2019s on the record, on tape as ridiculing them as ending the weekend. \u201cJust like he\u2019s on the record for saying renewable energy targets are quote \u2018nuts\u2019 and just as he\u2019s on the record for saying battery storage for renewable energy is as useful as the big banana.\u201d The opposition leader then used the Prime Minister\u2019s previous comments on electric cars to question his trustworthiness. \u201cThis is a Prime Minister who can\u2019t be trusted who himself says \u2018I\u2019m not concerned about what I said yesterday\u2019 so given he can't give any credence to what he said just yesterday why should Australians have regard for what he said today?,\u201d Mr Alabanese said. \u201cThis is a Prime Minister, on areas like electric vehicles, has invented a new way of operating this is electric gaslighting.\u201d The coalition government released the modelling on Friday which expects 100,000 jobs to be created by the emerging industries. The modelling also forecast coal exports would half by 2050 while electric vehicle usage would surge from the current levels of less than one per cent to around 90 per cent by 2050. In response to the criticism from the opposition party, Mr Morrison called out the Labor party for their failure to announce a climate plan. \u201cLabor don\u2019t even have a 2030 target, they have no plan and no modelling in terms of how they say they\u2019re getting to 2050,\u201d he said last week.

Perth came in with a total of 892mm since Jan 1 \u2013 making it the city\u2019s wettest year since 1995. In the east and north, the\u00a0back to back\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a events helped produce near or above average rainfall\u00a0for the remaining capitals. The wettest state compared to normal was NSW\u00a0with substantial flooding in both March and November.\u00a0\u00a0 As for extremes? Our hottest location on any day was Mardie in WA, at a scorching 47.9C on December 20th, and Perisher Valley dipping to an icy -10C on July 7h\u00a0takes the title of coldest temperature for 2021. Tully in Far North QLD was once again the winner of its infamous \u2018Golden Gumboot\u2019 as Australia\u2019s wettest town, collecting an impressive total of 5073.9mm\u00a0 To join the conversation, please\r\n  log in.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have returned to their California mansion after appearing in public for the first time since the birth of their daughter Lilibet. The pair attended the Global Citizen Live concert in New York to raise awareness on climate change, vaccine equality and famine - demanding new eco laws to halve US emissions by 2030. They then flew on a Dassault Falcon 2000 jet back to their mansion in Montecito, California. A flight on a private jet from New York to California is estimated to produce 17 tonnes of carbon emissions,  The Sun  reported. The average carbon footprint per person in the UK is 12.7 tonnes. \"I do think this is hypocrisy.

{"id":null,"body":"Sky News Digital Editor Jack Houghton The miserable ghost of Malcolm Turnbull has been caught out trying to re-write history by penning an article in US media claiming he was the Prime Minister who held back the \u201cclimate-denying political right in Australia\u201d. Mr Turnbull wrote that the deadly bushfires were proof the \u201cwicked, self-destructive idiocy of climate denialism must stop\u201d. \u201cEven as the fires rage, Murdoch\u2019s News Corp newspapers and television networks have been busy arguing that arsonists or a lack of controlled burning are the real causes of the fires,\u201d he wrote. Oh Malcom, how times have changed since you were Prime Minister. It is almost as if you forgot how you overlooked how you personally responded to the horror bushfire which tore through Tathra, wiping out 69 homes in 2018. Greens Senator Richard Di Natale complained in the aftermath that a lack of renewable investment had contributed to the bushfire season become more dangerous. And how did Mr Turnbull respond to those comments? \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Greens would try to politicise an event like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t attribute any particular event, whether it\u2019s a flood or fire or a drought or a storm, to climate change. \u201cBut clearly this is an environment, we have an environment, which has extremes. Bushfires are part of Australia, as indeed are droughts and floods.\u201d Malcolm Turnbull stated as a fact that you could not blame the bushfire in 2018 on climate change. Then two years later he wrote an article claiming that comments similar to his own were the fault of the evil Murdoch family.  How pathetic. How opportunistic. But Mr Turnbull was not done attempting to re-write history. \u201cAs Prime Minister, I tried to ensure that our climate and energy policies were governed by engineering and economics, not ideology and idiocy,\u201d he said. \u201cTragically, the climate-denying political right in Australia has turned what should be a practical question of how to respond to a real physical threat into a matter of values or belief.\u201d Mr Turnbull has even gone as far as to call for Australia to adopt a version of the US Green New Deal, championed by the insufferable elitist group of radical Democrats who have been dubbed \u201cThe Squad\u201d. \u201cAustralians no longer need to sacrifice economic growth to reduce emissions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must not waste this climate crisis. There are no excuses and not much time left. Australia and the world need a Green New Deal now.\u201d If only we had a leader, between say 2015 and 2018, who could have pushed for that deal. Perhaps then there would be no fires. Institute of Public Affairs director of policy Gideon Rozner said Mr Turnbull\u2019s comments from 2018 were \u201cthe same kind of denialism\u201d he derides today. \u2018In 2020, Malcolm Turnbull says that bushfires are the \u2018inevitable reality\u2019 of global warming. In 2018, Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 rightly \u2013 admonished Richard di Natale for politicising bushfires.\u201d he said. \u201cHe has come out of hiding to use these tragic bushfires to score political points against his old party room and media enemies.\u2019 \u201cOne suspects Turnbull\u2019s conversion to born-again climate evangelism is less about genuine conviction and more about ingratiating himself with the well-heeled cultural elites whose approval he has always craved.\u2019 \u201cScott Morrison would be wise to ignore his predecessor from now on. The extreme and sub-rational climate alarmism to which Turnbull now subscribes would, if taken seriously, cost thousands of jobs, jeopardise whole industries, and diminish living standards and prosperity for millions of Australians.\u201d ","headline":"&#8216;Miserable ghost&#8217; Malcolm Turnbull tries to re-write his record on bushfires","article_name":"cf3f451ad78970248614f7a607319e1d","article_url":"https:\/\/www.skynews.com.au\/australia-news\/politics\/miserable-ghost-malcolm-turnbull-tries-to-rewrite-his-record-on-bushfires\/video\/cf3f451ad78970248614f7a607319e1d","date_published":"2020-01-22 03:31:04","article_length":3582,"date_uploaded":"2022-04-18T06:43:44.729064","article_start_url":null,"source":"skyau"}

{"id":null,"body":"Sky News Digital Editor Jack Houghton Hollywood hypocrisy reached new levels of absurdity this week when Pamela Anderson \u2013 who is in town to film motoring industry commercials \u2013 thought it appropriate to lecture Australians about climate change and their diets. Activists rejoiced when the Baywatch star pressured the Queensland Government to ban meat at official functions and linked the latest deadly bushfires directly to climate change. \u201cAs you\u2019ve already noted, the science is clear: climate change has played a key role in the severity of this year\u2019s bushfires,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cJust as your government is surely working on emissions-saving energy and transport policies, you could lead by example by implementing a climate-friendly vegan food policy for government functions, along with transitioning the menu at Sometimes Strangers\u2019 Restaurant at Parliament House to an all-vegan one.\u201d Australia thanks you for your insights Professor Anderson.  Now could you please cash your check from Ultra Tune and hop back home on your fuel-guzzling plane. While in the air perhaps think about the hypocrisy of accepting money from a motoring company while flying around the world on carbon-producing planes. The discourse on this topic has already been perverted by activists who are using the deaths and tragedy of bushfires to propagate their political goals. We don\u2019t need washed up Hollywood hacks to profit from virtue signalling while we are still mourning as a nation. Not that Australia\u2019s activists mind. They happily promote Professor Anderson and requote her flawed science and inaccurate data to call for absurd notions like zero carbon emissions by 2030. Extremist group PETA was one organisation to cash-in on the professor\u2019s comments. It penned an article saying governments should heed her advice \u201cto save lives in the future\u201d. Yes, not listening to Professor Anderson equates to murder. These are the same activists who get their scientific advice from the 11,000 \u201cscientists\u201d who declared a climate emergency in an online petition recently. The decorated list of scientists included the names Micky Mouse, Harry Potter and his old headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Suddenly Pamela Anderson\u2019s thoughts on science seem comparatively not as absurd. So what does the science say about bushfires? Does research exist directly linking previous emissions policies to contemporary bushfires? No. There has not been a release of any scientific report analysing the cause of these specific bushfires yet.  There is a very vague mention in the most recent IPCC report of the potential window for hazard reduction burns shrinking in the Asia-Pacific region but there is, as of yet, no Australian specific research directly linking this to climate change. In fact, we know a large portion of the fires were caused by arsonists so the entire argument becomes moot if people are driving around bushland starting fires on purpose.  But let\u2019s look at what the actual science says and what is says specifically about Australia. In the latest IPCC report analysing bushfires authors do indeed suggest changing climate could shorten the number of days hazard reduction burns can take place. However, even if this happens, the authors only go as far to declare that it could potentially impact mitigation efforts. \u201cIn Australia, fire management will become increasingly challenging under climate change, potentially exacerbating conflicting management objectives for biodiversity conservation versus protection of property,\u201d IPCC scientists wrote. The authors also note that the phenomenon of shortening timeframes is only \u201cexpected\u201d to occur.  This means the line being trotted out by The Greens and eco-activists is only a prediction of what might happen in the future. It is certainly not proof that CO2 emissions are linked to anything influencing fire season preparation right now. \u201cClimate change is expected to increase the number of days with very high and extreme fire weather with greater changes where fire is weather-constrained (most of southern Australia; many, in particular eastern and northern, parts of New Zealand) than where it is constrained by fuel load and ignitions (tropical savannahs in Australia),\u201d the authors wrote. So when people, including former Hollywood superstars, lecture you about the \u201cscience\u201d make sure you ask for their sources. Often they simply do not exist.

{"id":null,"body":"Digital Editor Jack Houghton EXCLUSIVE: The financial arm of the Paris Agreement has squandered millions of dollars on airfares, hotel rooms and radically ballooning staffing costs \u2014 all in the name of fighting climate change. Sipped away in the form of champagne flutes on business class trips through Europe. Staffing costs at the South Korean headquarters of the Green Climate Fund totalled $35 million in 2017. Those same, handsomely paid pencil pushers also spent another $2.1 million on carbon-emitting plane trips and lavish hotel rooms. Australia gave this fund $200 million. That was our money and we deserve answers. But there is no accountability or transparency. Just the declaration that our money was not enough, and the equally unscientific claim that our refusal to further take part in this con is killing this planet. No wonder Australia was just asked to double its original commitment to $400 million. This year, Sky News can reveal the GCF\u2019s core staffing figure has exploded to $65 million while the broader admin bill has soared passed the $200 million mark. Australia\u2019s entire contribution to the climate war wasted on airfares, meals and accommodation. Fight the good fight, gentlemen. And have they eased up on airfares? Quite the opposite. This year they will spend more than $3.7 million on airfares and hotels \u2014 an extraordinary increase of $1.6 million. Documents detailing their 2020 budget outlook show they have asked for that $3.7 million travel figure to increase by another 11 per cent. So what has this bloated headquarters done with all this money? Well, Sky News has obtained crisis documents detailing why the budgets were increasing so rapidly. It turns out the project assessors tasked with disseminating the $14 billion funding pool have wasted massive chunks assessing proposals which were never viable. The documents warned that because strict eligibility requirements had not been put in place, staff had wasted years checking the viability of proposals only to discover the plans would never work. Without the extra money, the fund warned the entire roll-out of climate change initiates to developing nations could be destabilised. \u201cBecause the proposals currently under review were developed without the benefit of robust guidance and project eligibility requirements, both their quality and their linkage with country strategies and the GCF transformational goals remain variable,\u201d the document said. \u201cThis fact has significant administrative budget implications for the efforts of both the Secretariat and the AE. \u201cAs a practical matter, this means that many work years are currently being spent on the development and review of projects that prove to be unviable. This unproductive effort could be greatly reduced if there were clear eligibility requirements, better results-area guidance, and enhanced Secretariat engagement on project ideas well before the development and submission of full projects.\u201d The fund said that each proposal was soaking up nearly two months\u2019 worth of time for each staff member. \u201cOur analysis shows that the Secretariat is spending, on average, approximately 50 person days of review time on each public-sector project submission,\u201d the crisis document said. \u201cDuring that review, and through engagement with the relevant AE, it often becomes clear that the proposals that were developed and submitted lack viability, resulting in the AE significantly reworking the proposal and\/or, in some cases, withdrawing it from consideration.\u201d Bloated and inefficient, bordering on fraud. If the fund\u2019s own internal assessment is this scathing, can you imagine what an independent auditor would say about this mess? So what is the solution? Well, the climate fund has found an answer. It just asked the western world to chip in another $14 billion to finance their blustering attempts to solve the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d.  And the western world has just agreed. It is worth noting China has again decided not to contribute funds because it sees itself as still \u201cdeveloping\u201d. China also has access to GCF grants which, in itself, is an international disgrace. Thankfully, Prime Minister Scott Morrison had the foresight to pull out of this scam before we wasted more money. When you look at the financial situation of this fund it becomes clear that climate change has become an industry itself. This industry wants to expand, like any company does, and the rationale of a climate catastrophe is the perfect fundraising mechanism. You will not solve climate change by contributing funds to these buffoons, you will simply be buying them dinner and wine.

{"id":null,"body":"Australia will respond to its climate change commitments but the problem will not be solved until China gets on board, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says China must cut its carbon emissions if the dire predictions contained in the latest global climate change report are to be avoided. Responding to the release of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, Mr Morrison pointed out China\u2019s mammoth carbon footprint and the problem it poses to tackling climate change. \"We cannot ignore the fact that the developing world accounts for two thirds of global emissions and those emissions are rising,\" he said during a press conference on Tuesday. \"That is a stark fact! It is also a clear fact that China's emissions account for more than the OECD combined.\" Mr Morrison also referenced India, Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia.\u00a0 \"Unless we can get the change in the developing countries of the world then what we are seeing in the IPCC reports will occur,\" he said.\u00a0 Mr Morrison batted away criticism that Australia\u2019s climate change response had been insufficient and part of the \"problem\u201d. \"Australia is part of the solution, our emissions have fallen by 20 per cent since 2005.\u00a0 \"Australia is, and must continue to do its part and Australia has a strong track record of performance. And we intend for that to continue to increase in the years ahead.\" The prime minister emphasised that technology - rather than taxation and a crackdown on developing countries\u2019 right to industrialise - is the correct response to the dire predictions contained in the IPCC report, which was released on Monday. \u201cThe Australian approach is not to tax them or deny them the employment and the jobs and the industries that they should have, just as we should have them here in this country, but to enable,\" he said. \u201cWorld history teaches one thing. Technology changes everything! That is the game changer. \u201cSo what is important is we ensure the technology breakthroughs that are necessary to transform the world over the next 10, 20, and 30 years are realised.\" Mr Morrison also doubled down on his insistence that he would stick to a climate change policy that would lower emissions while also not damaging Australia\u2019s economy.\u00a0 \"I won't be signing a blank cheque on behalf of Australians to targets without plans. We will set out a clear plan as we have been working to do,\" he said. \"I will ensure that we have a plan that addresses the need for jobs, and industries, that can be supported by new energy technologies both now and into the future.\u201d Mr Morrison\u2019s comments follow the release of IPCC sixth assessment report on Monday, three months ahead of the Glasgow 2021 Climate Change Conference. In contrast to earlier reports, the latest iteration outlines climate change is \u201cunequivocally\u201d being caused by humans and that the 1.5C warming threshold would be reached by 2040. More than 14,000 international scientific studies contributed to the report which warned once the world had surpassed the 1.5C threshold, catastrophic weather events due to runaway climate change would occur. The consequences for Australia are just as dire, with the report detailing how the country has warmed by 1.4C in comparison to the global average of 1.1C. The report concluded Australia\u2019s fire season and the amount of extreme fire days it would experience will continue to surge. \u201cThe intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia (high confidence) and New Zealand (medium confidence),\u201d the report says. Along with a lengthened fire season, climate change in Australia has resulted in higher rising sea levels than the global average, less winter rainfall in southern Australia and a decrease in snow cover. But the report warned heavier coastal and river flooding, increased fire season intensity and longer bushfires will get worse under increased global temperatures.

It bears on the wellbeing of future generations.\" The deal will cover clean electricity, clean coal, methane emissions, deforestation, carbon capture and storage and joint work to implement its 2030 emissions reductions targets and execute the 2015 Paris Agreement. China and US agreeing to team up has been hailed a big boost for the UN Climate Change Conference with ongoing talks leading to no current deal.\u00a0 It may also signal an easing of tensions between the two countries. Chinese President Xi Jinping chose not to attend the climate discussions with the powerhouse not having a major presence the the talks until now.

{"id":null,"body":"As the world faces a legitimate crisis those who profit from spruiking the fake climate catastrophe have started to get anxious that they are no longer the main focus. There are billions of dollars up for grabs as the federal government attempts to pull Australia back from economic ruin with stimulus but very little of that will trickle into the coffers of climate cultists. Activists at the Climate Council hope to change that. They\u2019ve released research dubbed The Clean Jobs Plan and have billed it as the solution to rebuilding Australia\u2019s economy after it lost 830,000 jobs to COVID-19. The only problem is their plan will cost billions of dollars and create just tens of thousands of jobs. In one scenario, the Climate Council is asking governments to spend $2.25 billion employing 15,000 people to install \u201csolar and wind farms\u201d and batteries. The cost of a scheme is so inefficient that for every $1 million dollars taxpayers spend only 6.7 jobs would be created. And for a plan to \u201cretrofit\u201d public buildings it wants another $1.5 billion to employ 8,000 people to install \u201cenergy-efficient lights\u201d or occupancy sensors. Each million dollars from this idea would yield just 5.3 jobs. Despite the glaring efficiency issues with the scheme, the Canberra Times swallowed the idea whole without question. \u201cHow tackling climate change could help the ACT\u2019s coronavirus job crunch,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cNew modelling has claimed 1000 jobs could be created in the ACT that would help absorb some COVID-19 job losses while tackling climate change.\u201d Not once in the 400-word news article did the Canberra Times mention the exorbitant cost to taxpayers of each project. Imagine how these same journalists would scrutinise the document if it was written by a mining lobby or was leaked from a government meeting. In fact, that happened in May when the National COVID-19 Commission manufacturing report was leaked detailing a plan to boost the domestic gas industry, creating up to 412,000 new jobs by 2030. The energy reforms across all industries were expected to create 170,000 well paid direct jobs and up to 800,000 indirect jobs. How did the Canberra Times respond to that report? \u201cCOVID-19 commission needs to come clean on gas industry links,\u201d the headline read. \u201cHundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money has been, and is going to be spent, on necessary fiscal measures before this pandemic is over. \u201cBut poorly targeted spending will do damage to the economy, increase unemployment and prolong the recession. \u201cThe livelihoods and well-being of hundreds of thousands of Australians hang in the balance.\u201d This was supposed to be a news article even though the first few paragraphs were simply emotion fuelled opinions by the writer. And other bizarre statements were published in the recent Canberra Times article without any pushback, including the claim that climate change was a bigger threat than the coronavirus which has killed hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. \u201cCOVID-19 is a crisis, it\u2019s clearly a crisis\u2026 however, the climate crisis is a way bigger crisis on a global basis and will have deeper and much more long-lasting effects,\u201d Climate Councillor Greg Bourne said in the Canberra Times. \u201cHere is the opportunity to rebuild economies and get people back to work, which we need to do anyway but helping it fix the future rather than just replicate the past.\u201d It is a little disturbing a person can be so consumed by propaganda that they genuinely believe climate change is worse than 614,000 deaths and a global economic tragedy. But this line of rhetoric will intensify in coming months as the spotlight fades on their cause. We\u2019ve even seen it on an international scale with The UN-funded financial arm of the Paris Agreement labelling COVID-19 an \u201copportunity\u201d to raise funds for climate change action and \u201crelaunch economies on low-emission, climate-resilient trajectories\u201d. Any tragedy is opportunity to make a quick buck, it seems.

{"id":null,"body":"The Australian Medical Association has weighed in on the climate change debate, claiming the Morrison government can no longer \u201cignore the climate emergency\u201d. Australia\u2019s chief doctors\u2019 body has labelled climate change a \"health emergency\" and thrown its support behind climate change bills proposed by Independent MP Zali Steggall. It comes after the House of Representatives Environment and Energy Committee moved to reject Ms Steggall\u2019s two climate change bills aimed at formally legislating a net-zero by 2050 emissions target. The bill would establish an independent Climate Change Commission which would advise the relevant minister on the government\u2019s climate change progress towards net zero, and would publish annual reports. The Australian Medical Association came out against the decision not to pass Ms Steggall's bills, with President Dr Omar Khorshid labelling climate change a \"health emergency\". \u201cThe AMA supports the climate change bills proposed by Zali Steggall in late 2020. Our support is based on the irrefutable evidence that emissions need to reach net zero by at least 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\u201d Dr Khorshid told Skynews.com.au. \"Doctors are not only on the frontline of COVID they are on the frontline of every health emergency. Climate change is a health emergency. We have an opportunity now to reduce emissions and we should be doing everything possible to achieve this. \"The proposed legislation outlined a sensible and well-structured response to the existential threat posed by climate change and included a clear plan for reaching net zero by 2050.\" Upon the release of the Environment and Energy Committee's report earlier on Wednesday afternoon, the Australian Medical Association called for the government to commit to Ms Steggall\u2019s bills. \"The AMA is deeply concerned that without a plan, Australia will be left behind. A number of global scorecards have now put Australia at the bottom of their lists regarding climate action and responsibility,\" Dr Khorshid said in a media release earlier on Wednesday. As the principle body representing doctors and medical students, the AMA warned of the potential health impacts of global warming \u201cabove pre-industrial levels\u201d including deaths from \u201cextreme heat\u201d and the spread of water and air borne diseases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report on the impacts of an increase of global temperature of 1.5 c above pre-industrial levels In the report it said there was \u201chigh to very high confidence\u201d that climate change could lead to greater risks of injuries, disease and death. The AMA's initial statement then went on to criticise the House Environment and Energy Committee, chaired by LNP MP Ted O\u2019Brien, for ignoring widespread support for climate action. \u201cThe committee\u2019s report has ignored the wide community support for stronger action on climate change and does not reflect the urgent health and environmental imperatives,\u201d it said. \"Australians are now experiencing the consequences of climate change. For example the horrific bushfire season of 2019-20 and the intense and prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke.\u00a0 \"Australians deserve and need a better and more ambitious commitment than the one currently on offer.

The proposed commission would advise the government\u2019s relevant minister who in turn would set policies consistent with meeting net zero by 2050. The CCC would release annual reports into whether the government was on course to meet the target, and would also advise the Commonwealth on the effect fossil fuel exports would have on climate change.

{"id":null,"body":"Greta Thunberg has taken aim at world leaders and accused them of \"shamelessly congratulating themselves\" on tackling climate change - dismissing their climate slogans as \"blah, blah, blah\".\u00a0 Teen climate enthusiast Greta Thunberg has berated world leaders and accused them of faking climate action as she warned the world is \u201cvery much speeding in the wrong direction\u201d. Speaking at the Youth4Climate conference in Milan, the 18-year-old activist mocked leaders, particularly targeting British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for climate promises over-used slogans, dismissing them as \u201cblah, blah, blah\u201d. \u201cThis is all we hear from our so-called leaders \u2013 words. Words that sound great but so far has led to no action,\u201d she said. \u201cBlah blah blah. This is not about some expensive, politically correct green act of bunny hugging or blah blah blah. \u201cBuild back better; blah, blah, blah. Green economy; blah, blah, blah. Net zero by 2050; blah, blah, blah. Net zero; blah, blah, blah. Climate neutral, blah blah blah.\u201d Ms Thunberg quoted Mr Johnson in her address, rubbishing his speech to world leaders during a virtual summit about tackling climate change. In April the British Prime Minister said climate change should focus on \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cjobs\u201d. \u201cThis is not all about some expensive, politically correct green act of bunny hugging,\u201d Mr Johnson told the summit. Ms Thunberg also echoed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying \u201cfighting climate change calls for innovation, cooperation and willpower to make the changes that this world needs\u201d. \u201cWe need to walk the talk, if we can do this together, we can do this,\u201d she added. The Swedish activist called for a \u201csmooth transition\u201d to a low carbon economy, warning \u201cthere is no planet B, there is no planet blah\u201d. \u201cOur hopes and dreams drown in their [leaders\u2019] empty words and promises. Of course, we need constructive dialogue but they\u2019ve had 30 years of blah, blah, blah and where has that lead us,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll this while the media is reporting on what the leaders say that they are going to do instead of what they are actually doing, and then not holding leaders accountable for their action, or rather, inaction.\u201d Ms Thunberg said more than half of the world\u2019s Co2 emissions had occurred since 1990 and a third since 2005, and referenced a\u00a0recent report from the United Nations which said global emissions are expected to rise by 16 per cent by 2030. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we can still do this. Change is not only possible but urgently necessary but not if we go on like today. They say they want \u2018solutions\u2019, but you cannot solve a crisis that you do not understand. You cannot balance a budget if you do not count all the numbers,\u201d Ms Thunberg said. \u201cOur leaders\u2019 intentional lack of action is a betrayal towards all present and future generations. The people in power cannot claim they are trying because they are clearly not as they continue opening up brand new coal mines, oil fields and pipelines, pretending to have ambitious climate policies while granting new oil alliances. \u201cShamelessly congratulating themselves while still failing to come up even with the bare minimum and long overdue funding to help vulnerable countries deal with the impacts of the climate crisis.\u201d \u201cIf this is what they consider to be climate action, then we don\u2019t want it.\u201d Ms Thunberg further accused leaders of pandering to young activists while ignoring their pleas for action. \u201cThey invite cherry-picked young people to come to meetings like this to pretend that they are listening to us, but they are not,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are clearly not listening to us, and they never have. \u201cWe can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible or not. We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is.\u00a0 \u201cHope is not passive, hope is not blah, blah, blah. Hope is telling the truth, hope is taking action and hope always comes from the people.\u201d Ms Thunberg concluded her address by calling for dramatic annual emission cuts \u201cunlike anything the world has ever seen\u201d. She flagged, however, the world must change to achieve appropriate climate targets as the technological solutions to reach them were not yet possible. To join the conversation, please\r\n  log in.

Mr Dean said the advertising for \u2018The Great Reset\u2019 was \u201cjust about as cliched and vomit-inducing as the most inane corporate ad can be\u201d. \u201cThis promo is saying that all the very worst things in the world, from the coronavirus to bushfires to riots to pollution to poverty are somehow linked. \u201cThen it is claiming they can magically disappear.

Mr Dean said ultimately \u201clunatics including Prince Charles and the United Nations and the IMF want to replicate the global response to COVID and repurpose it for climate change, to enforce zero net emissions\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":"Close to 200 nations around the world agreed on a deal to fight global warming at the Glasgow climate conference but many were disappointed with India after they demanded a re-wording of a section of the document. Negotiators from across almost 200 countries have finally agreed on a new deal to fight climate change after India demanded a toning down of a section of the draft proposal that focused on \"phasing out\" coal. India would only agree to the cover consensus document - titled the Glasgow Climate Pact - if the wording to phase out coal and inefficient subsidies of fossil fuels was changed to\u00a0 \"phase-down\". The delegates from 197 nations accepted the deal despite being \"profoundly disappointed\" as not agreeing would mean the deal being under jeopardy and an ongoing stalemate after two weeks of meetings and conferences. COP26 President Alok Sharma had earlier broke down during proceedings of the last-minute change as vulnerable countries argued stronger action on fossil fuels was needed to save the earth. \"May I just say to all the delegates, I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry,\" he told hundreds of officials and delegates. \"I also understand the deep disappointment, but I think as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package. Indian delegates said the new wording would be \"to call upon states to escalate the development and deployment and dissemination of technologies to transition to low emission energy systems, including by scaling up clean power generation, including escalating to phase-down unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the support towards a just transition.\" Negotiators from Switzerland, Mexico, the Marshall Islands and the European Union were angry, adding the change was against the rules as it came late. Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the re-wording would make it harder to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. The agreement will also see more urgent emission cuts and more money o developing countries to assist them in adapting to the impacts of climate change. The new deal is a positive for Australia, who heavily rely on coal exports, and have refused to budge on phasing it out. Prior to leaving to Scotland for the conference, Mr Morrison said Australia's policy was \"very clear\" in that it would \"not be engaged in those sort of mandates and bans\" on coal. \"It won't be the Australia government's policy. All countries are coming at this task from different places, their economies are different. And as a global community, we've got to understand that,\" he said. \"Developing countries have different challenges to those in Europe. Indeed, Australia's economy in the shape and form of our economy is very different to many of those as well.\" Australia is among a number of countries that have been told to set more ambitious 2030 emissions and reduction targets. Mr Morrison, who addressed the summit last week, said driving down the costs of low and no emissions technologies was what will help Australia reach net zero. However, he refused to fast track the country's target to 2030 and would only commit to its old promise of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by the same year. The United Nations climate agency released the first draft\u00a0 on Wednesday (local time) where they noted current pledges by countries are \"insufficient\" in responding to the worsening global warming impacts in developing countries. The\u00a0 seven-page proposal , published on Wednesday morning (local time), has urged countries to \"revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determine contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022\". The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, set the goal of avoiding the increase in the average global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and limiting the goal of not exceeding 1.5 degrees.

{"id":null,"body":"In a speech to dozens of world leaders, the Prime Minister said combating climate change \"will not be met the same way\" as he pledged to spend billions of dollars to assist poorer countries in fighting global warming. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told dozens of world leaders to \"bet on\" scientists, not politicians, as the people who will lead the way in finding a solution to combat climate change. \"The challenge of combating climate change will not be met the same way, and it will be met by people who frankly are largely no in this room,\" he told the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) on Monday night. \"It will be our scientists, our technologists, our engineers, our entrepreneurs, our industrialists and our financiers that will actually chart the path to net zero and it is up to us as leaders of government to back them in.\" He said it was the \"Australian way to bet on\" the experts in the field. Australia pledged to spend more money to help developing Pacific neighbouring nations to fight climate change and seek an agreement on rapid cuts to global emissions. \"Cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies,\" he said. \"And achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially in developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life.\" The Prime Minister added \"technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy\" and compared it to the fast development of the coronavirus vaccine that is seeing the world slowly return to a pre-pandemic life. Australia will double its climate commitment to its Pacific and South East Asian partners to $2 billion until 2025. Mr Morrison spruiked his government's commitment to net zero by 2050 and said Australia's emissions would fall by 35 per cent by 2030. However he failed to provide an update on the official 26 to 28 per cent drop from 2005 levels, a figure significantly out of step with the richer nations of the world. While the 2030 target could be seen as ambitious, scientists believe it is essential in giving the world a chance to stop global warming of more than 1.5 degrees. Mr Morrison said international collaboration, partnerships and high-integrity international carbon offsets were critical in achieving net zero emissions globally. \u201cDriving the emergence of low-emissions technologies and fostering their widespread adoption is at the heart of our plan to reach net zero,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve set cost targets for clean hydrogen, low cost solar, low carbon steel and aluminium, energy storage, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon.\u201d Earlier in the day, Mr Morrison hit back at criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron that he lied about the trilateral agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom that saw the $90 billion submarine deal axed with France. Mr Macron was quizzed by Australian reporters on whether Mr Morrison had lied to him to which he replied, \"I don't think, I know\". Mr Morrison hit back saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cop sledging on Australia, I\u2019m not going to cop that on behalf of Australians\". \u201cI can deal with whatever people throw at me but Australia has a proud record when it comes to our defence capability.\u201d He reiterated he had to put Australia's interests first and took a swipe at France by saying the submarine deal was \"not going to meet Australia's strategic requirements\". \u201cAustralia\u2019s defence interests had to come first, this submarine was not the submarine that Australia needed. \u201cThere have been significant changes that have occurred in our strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific which have completely changed the game.\u201d The pair are expected to cross paths again at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, after their awkward encounter at the G20 summit in the Italian city of Rome.

The net zero target was signed off by federal cabinet on Monday night and was 100 per cent supported by the government, Mr Morrison said.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Australians want action on climate change, they're taking action on climate change. But they also want to protect their jobs and their livelihoods,\" he said.\u00a0 \"They also want to keep the cost of living down and they also want to protect the Australian way of life, especially in rural and regional areas. \"Australians want a plan that gets the balance right and our plan to reach what will be our new official target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050... gets the balance right.\"\u00a0 Mr Morrison said the federal government understood the need for climate change action and was already taking steps to reduce emissions.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We're already delivering. We're already down the path.

We've listened very carefully to both the concerns and the ambitions of Australians in pulling this together to ensure we get the plan right,\" he said.\u00a0 \"Our plan most importantly backs Australians to achieve what they want to achieve when it comes to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\" The productivity commission will review the climate policy every five years, with the Prime Minister declaring there will be no cost to jobs and no new taxes would be imposed.\u00a0 \"It will not cost jobs, not in farming, mining or gas because what we are doing with this plan is positive things, enabling things,\" Mr Morrison said.\u00a0 \"It will not increase energy bills. It is not a revolution but a careful evolution to take advantage of changes in our markets. And it's not a set and forget plan. It has an insurance policy review mechanism to make sure that it keeps delivering for regional Australia.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the net zero plan was about technology not taxes and choices not mandates.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The vison here is to take practical action to achieve net zero by 2050.

{"id":null,"body":"Anthony Albanese said Scott Morrison is \"hoping that people are goldfish and they don\u2019t remember what happened just two years ago\" as the Prime Minister appeared to backflip on how his government would tackle climate change. Anthony Albanese has launched a blistering attack on Scott Morrison over the Prime Minister\u2019s pledge to establish a $1 billion fund to invest in the development of new low emissions technology. The Opposition Leader said Mr Morrison\u2019s announcements to tackle climate change are \u201call about style and all about spin\u201d, as he declared the Coalition \u201ccannot be taken seriously when it comes to climate action\u201d. \u201cFirstly, Scott Morrison didn\u2019t take this policy to Glasgow because a bit like his EV (electric vehicle) policy it lacks a great deal of substance. It\u2019s all about style and all about spin,\u201d he told Sky News Australia\u2019s Peter Stefanovic. \u201cNow he comes back after the conference, he\u2019s announcing policy. If he could have landed any of his 20 energy policies, we\u2019d know about that now. \u201cAnd once again it\u2019s all about the politics so note in the articles on the front page, it\u2019s all about wedging Labor, not about the substance.\u201d The Low Emissions Technology Commercialisation Fund, announced on Wednesday, will combine $500 million of new capital for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, from the government, and $500 million from private sector investors. Mr Morrison said the fund would back Australian early stage companies to develop new technology. \u201cOur Plan to reach net zero by 2050 is an Australian one that\u2019s focused on technology not taxes and this fund backs in Australian companies to find new solutions,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cAustralia can become a world leader in creating low emissions technology that is both affordable and scalable, helping get emissions down while creating jobs. \u201cWe are backing Australian businesses by creating an environment for their successful ideas to thrive in contrast to Labor\u2019s approach to always wanting to tax success.\u201d On Tuesday, the Morrison government released its Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy, which will see it work with industry to enhance consumer choice, create jobs and reduce emissions in Australia\u2019s transport sector. But the plan has been noted for its similarities to a Labor policy, which Mr Morrison criticised during the last federal election. \u201cIf the Prime Minister comes forward with serious policy, without trying to talk about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the very body he tried to abolish, as if he is now a supporter, it\u2019s a bit like his EV policy,\u201d Mr Albanese said. \u201cIt fails the laugh test. He\u2019s hoping that people are goldfish, and they don\u2019t remember what happened just two years ago.\u201d The Labor leader continued to spray the Coalition further. \u201cThis government cannot be taken seriously when it comes to climate action,\u201d Mr Albanese said. \u201cThe Australian people know that. This is a Prime Minister who pretends he has not history in all of these issues. \u201cAnd the history of this is, he tried to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, he tried to abolish ARENA, he tried to abolish the renewable energy target, he opposed electric vehicles, he opposed all of the new technologies that he talks about. \u201cAnd still with the announcements, there is a lack of substance.\u201d Mr Albanese also declared the government is \u201cthrashing about\u201d and \u201ctrying to come into the 21st century\u201d. \u201cNew technologies have been taken up overseas in far greater rates because we have a government that has held back the uptake of new technology,\u201d he said. Mr Morrison said he had to \"secure Australia's place\" in the new energy economy as countries with net zero commitments now cover 80 per cent of the world's gross domestic product and 90 per cent of Australia's exports are to those nations. \"The world does not need to be punished for climate change, we just need to fix it,\" he said from Victoria on Wednesday as he announced the funding. \"And it will be fixed painstakingly step-by-step by entrepreneurs by scientists, by technologists, by innovators, by industrialists, by financiers, by risk takers. \"That is the Australian way. That's the way I have been championing on the world stage.\" To join the conversation, please\r\n  log in.

The Duke of Sussex has been dubbed a 'hypocrite' after he flew home on a private jet following a charity polo match in Aspen, Colorado. The Prince faced backlash on social media after boarding the 20-seater plane, just three months after calling climate change one of the 'most pressing issues we are facing'. The \u00a345million Gulfstream jet is understood to belong to one of Harry's polo friends, US businessman Marc Ganzi,  The Sun reported . In May, Prince Harry warned that mental health and climate change were 'the two most pressing issues' society is facing. \"Climate change is really playing a huge part in this as well as social media, and we just don't,\" he told Oprah Winfrey. \"I mean, I know lots of people out there are doing as best they can to try and fix these issues, but that whole sort of analogy of walking into the bathroom with a mop when the bath is over-flooding, rather than just turning the tap off. \"Are we supposed to accept that these problems are just going to grow and grow and grow and then we're going to have to adapt to them and build resilience amongst the next generation and the next generation and the next generation? \"Or is there really a moment, a reckoning moment, post-COVID, where we can actually look at each other, look at ourselves and go 'we need to do better about stopping or allowing the things that are causing so much harm to so many of us at the source, rather than being distracted by the symptom'.\" About 2.4 per cent of global CO2 emissions come from aviation, and in just one hour, a  single private jet  can emit two tonnes of CO2. Royal author Tom Quinn accused the Duke of being \"enormously hypocritical\". \"This appears to be enormously hypocritical, given all his talk about climate change,\" Mr Quinn told The Sun. \"Harry seems to see himself as someone who guides the rest of the world and that his own behaviour isn't relevant. It is a huge blind spot.\" \"Prince Harry takes a private jet home from a polo match. Please lecture me more on privilege and environmentalism,\" GB News host Patrick Christys tweeted.

{"id":null,"body":"Demonstrators will protest Prime Minister Scott Morrison's refusal to budge on methane emissions and the continued used of coal with a list of demands they want met to tackle global warming. Up to 1,000 protesters will rally in Sydney's CBD on Saturday for immediate action on global warming after Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to reduce methane emissions and phase out coal at the climate summit in Glasgow this week. The rally is expected to start around 12pm in Hyde Park North in the city where they will march just under two kilometres to First Fleet Park at The Rocks. Organisers and demonstrators have a list of demands they want met including: New South Wales Health have given an exemption for the rally to go ahead. There will be minor road closures along Elizabeth St and Loftus St with police to monitor the crowd. The protest will mark the Global Day of Action on Climate. Sydney branch Secretary of Maritime Union of Australia, Paul Keating, said the Coalition net-zero by 2050 plan is a \"farce\". \"The billions of dollars going towards Morrison's 'gas-fired recovery', dubious CCS (carbon capture storage) technology and now nuclear submarines is money that could be used to support workers and communities in the transition away from fossil fuels,\" he said. He stressed it was important to invest in publicly-owned renewable energy and create \"thousands of jobs\" from offshore wind to new zero-carbon transport fuels and health and education. Co-chair of the rally, Erima Dall, described Mr Morrison as \"the worst among world leaders\" after he refused to reduce methane emissions and phase out coal at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow earlier this week. \"He has refused to increase Australia's 2030 target despite many other countries promising increased efforts,\" she said. While Deanna Hayes, from the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives Association warned climate change is a \"bigger threat\" to the health of billions than COVID-19. \"Heatwaves are the second biggest killer worldwide after the pandemic,\" she said. \"These effect will only worsen in Australia with the continued burning of coal and gas.\" She said the quick response by the government on the coronavirus pandemic should be replicated for global warming. Mr Morrison refused to cut Australia's methane emissions by 30 percent this decade despite close to 100 countries backing the plan led by the European Union and US President Joe Biden. Mr Biden described the Global Methane Pledge as a \"game changing commitment\" that will prevent global warming. \"One of the most important things we can do between now and 2030, to keep 1.5C in reach, is reduce our methane emissions as soon as possible,\" he told the world leaders at the Glasgow climate summit on Tuesday. Methane, generated in cows' digestive systems, in landfill waste and in oil and gas production, is short-lived in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide but was 80 times more potent in warming the Earth. The Australian government also decided again joining more than 40 countries in committing to phased out coal power with the country focused on developing technology and not \"wiping out industries. The five biggest users of coal, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Poland and Ukraine pledged to end the use of coal power by the 2030s \"or as soon as possible thereafter\" for the wealthy and the 2040s by developing nations. The US claims the pledge, announced in September, includes 70 per cent of the global economy and half of all methane emissions. Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the nation did not want to set specific targets for certain emissions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a net-zero goal for 2050 for the whole economy. We\u2019re not setting sector-specific targets, and we\u2019re not setting gas-specific values, we\u2019re pursuing the entirety,\u201d he told reporters and environmentalists at COP26. \u201cThe number that counts is the CO2-equivalent concentration in the atmosphere, that is what counts.... Specific gases, they contribute to that overall outcome... (but) the overall outcome (is what) we continue to focus on.\u201d He said there was currently \"no affordable, practical or large-scale way\" to reduce emissions other than culling the number of sheep and cattle. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said the Nationals had told Mr Morrison to not commit to the methane pledge prior to leaving to Glasgow. The world's biggest methane emitter, Brazil, has signed up. Other countries include Canada, New Zealand, Britain, Argentina, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Big players who decided to not join the pledge include Australia, China, Russia and India. To join the conversation, please\r\n  log in.

Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese says the Nationals are a \u201croadblock\u201d to climate action, criticising Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce for his \u201cincoherent ramblings\u201d. Mr Joyce appeared on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday where he refused to commit to a net zero target while the coal industry was still successful in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister was questioned on his position on climate change and if he would support an emissions reduction target if coal jobs were spared. \u201cNo, no, it's the little old bush accountant saying that lots of clients have ideas, but if you sit down with them and say, \u2018okay, that's your idea, let's prudently go about this because otherwise you will get yourself in more strife than the early settlers\u2019,\u201d he said. Mr Albanese hit back at the Deputy Prime Minister for his \u201cincoherent rambling about climate change\u201d and labelled him and his party a \u201croadblock\u201d to action. \u201cThe fact is that whilst Labor supports net zero emissions, the Coalition have net zero credibility when it comes to climate change,\u201d the Opposition Leader said. \u201cAnd we saw that again today with Barnaby Joyce\u2019s incoherent ramblings when it comes to climate action. \u201cThe Nats (National Party) aren\u2019t just a rabble, they\u2019re a roadblock. It\u2019s very clear that they are completely divided when it comes to climate change.\u201d Mr Albanese spruiked Labor\u2019s climate credentials and said climate action was \u201cgood for jobs\u201d and lowering energy prices despite the Nationals\u2019 argument that it will adversely affect the regions. While the federal government has not yet committed to a net zero by 2050 target, all states and territories as well as key industries and business groups have publicly supported the goal. \u201cAustralia remains a pariah whilst we don\u2019t adopt net zero by 2050,\u201d Mr Albanese said. \u201cThis government have a climate of division. They are divided between the Liberal Party and the National Party, they\u2019re divided between themselves internally within the Liberal Party and within the National Party, and then when they get together as a Coalition. \u201cVery clearly, what it will take is a Labor government that\u2019s prepared to work with industry, prepared to work with the community, to actually take action on climate that will create jobs.\u201d Mr Joyce\u2019s comments come after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg warned that Australia will be \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d and will lose foreign investment if it did not commit to stronger action on climate change. \u201cThere is a message here for business: Opportunities will abound and it will be those businesses that recognise these trends and put plans in place to adapt that will have the most promising futures,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said in a virtual speech to the Australian Industry Group. \u201cClimate change and its impacts are not going away. It represents a structural and systemic shift in our financial system, which will only gain pace over time.\u201d Several Liberal MPs have been vocal about their support for a more ambitious climate target, including Jason Falinski, Dave Sharma, Trent Zimmerman and Warren Entsch, however, Mr Frydenberg is the most senior Cabinet minister to publicly endorse the goal.

{"id":null,"body":"Labor has spent several months blaming the devastation of Australia\u2019s deadly bushfires on the Coalition\u2019s supposed climate change inaction. For those who view politics through a cursory lens it would appear Labor were the ones pushing for tough emissions reductions measures. But in a trainwreck interview for Anthony Albanese, which aired on Sky News this morning, the party\u2019s hypocrisy has been exposed. Mr Albanese has no climate policies. No emissions reductions targets at all. The Coalition will reduce emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 using 2005 levels as a baseline. Mr Albanese and Labor have no counter to that figure and the opportunistic Labor leader has awkwardly revealed he has no plans to produce one. Not having climate change targets of their own shows Labor is just using the issue for short-term gain. Mr Albanese argues the science is settled. If that is the case then he should have no problems producing a policy solution for climate change. If the science wont change between now and the next election it doesn\u2019t matter when Labor\u2019s plan is released. Unless of course he cares more about votes than saving the planet. \u201cThe climate is changing \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing the consequences right now,\u201d Mr Albanese wrote on Twitter today. \u201cOur natural environment is one of our most precious assets. It must be protected.\u201d Empty, hollow rhetoric which solves nothing. For a party which claims to follow the science its sloganeering is curiously devoid of practical solutions. Despite what the feral left will say, this writer accepts the findings contained in IPCC reports. The dispute is about how a country strikes a balance between energy reform by minimising economic damage and maximising environmental impact. It could be argued that maximum emissions reduction impact would be gained from scrapping the Paris Agreement which allows China to increase its emissions infinitely from 13,000 mega tonnes of CO2 today to an anticipated 16,000 mega tonnes in 2030. If Australia eliminated all emissions today it would wipe 530 mega tonnes off the global map. The Paris Agreement, what the world holds up as the solution to climate change, allows China to create the equivalent of five Australian economies in the next decade. Anthony Albanese knows this and he knows the solution to the issue will not be decided by reducing domestic geo-centric emissions in Australia. He knows how damaging Labor\u2019s war on coal was at the last election and he is attempting to play both sides. He also knows that one of the most devastating moments of the campaign trail came when Bill Shorten refused to reveal how much a 45 per cent emissions reduction target would cost the economy. When it was revealed by economist Brian Fisher that the policy would cost $264 billion and kill 167,000 jobs the election result was sealed. Why would people vote for a party who would sacrifice so much to achieve so little? A much smarter solution is to create the technologies which will one day replace fossil fuels and pressure the world\u2019s largest emitters to agree to emissions reduction targets. Which is why the Coalition is probing 100 new technologies to invest in like in hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium production, biofuels and waste-to-energy. If Australia can reduce emissions by 26 per cent in the next decade so can a superpower like China. And any suggestions from Labor that Australia should influence China by leading by example are completely puerile. President Xi Jinping is an evil dictator who is keeping hundreds and thousands of Muslims in re-education slave camps and he will not be swayed by a nice gesture of morality. He will only be swayed by economic sanctions. But Labor has been completely silent about this reality. If Mr Albanese does not start displaying some honestly about the issue he risks throwing away any chance of being elected. In the interview with Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell he could neither throw his support behind the Adani coalmine or criticise it.  Instead, he disassociated himself from it all together, repeatedly referring to it as being a private sector project, insinuating government should not get involved. He then went on to talk about how important coal was for Australia. \u201cPeople in Queensland and everywhere else know, who are involved in the industry, knows that the industry is continuing,\u201d Mr Albanese said.  \u201cIf you gave got a 50 per cent renewable energy target, by definition there is 50 per cent coming from fossil fuels. \u201cSo, let\u2019s be realistic there about what the framework is domestically and internationally. Of course, there will continue to be coal exports; I have made that very clear.\u201d Mr Albanese screams about climate change one moment then spruiks coal the next. He knows Queenslanders will not tolerate another war on coal. Playing both sides is a dangerous game and hypocrisy is a very poisonous chalice to drink from.

US President Joe Biden has been accused by social media users of falling asleep during remarks made a by a speaker at the climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The video, shared by  The Washington Post , shows Mr Biden listening to an orator discuss the historical importance of the event and how the conference can have the \"power to make decisions and reach agreements which will affect the lives of generations to come\", before closing his eyes. Dressed in a blue suit and donning a black face mask, he shuts his eyes for roughly eight seconds, before opening them briefly and then closing them again for 21 seconds. He opens his eye when an aide whispers something into the President's ear. Mr Biden appeared to wipe his eyes once the adviser leaves before turning his attention back to the end of the speech as the rest of the room applauded. Some Twitter users labelled the 46th US President a \"mess\" while one others were simply baffled how someone could appear to fall asleep during an important conference.

President Biden apologised during the climate summit for his predecessor Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord that set the world back. \"I guess I shouldn't apologise, but I do apologise for the fact that the United States and the last administration pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,\" he said without mentioning his name on Monday. He stressed global warming is one of the biggest challenges in our \"lifetimes\" and will be a \"threat to human existence\" if the world did not come together to find a solution. \"Right now, we are falling short, there's no time to hand back, sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves,\" he said. \"This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases.\" Prior to the conference he said he was disappointed countries \"not only Russia and China\" did not show up with commitments to combat climate change. President Biden said it was up to wealthy nations to assist poorer countries in fighting climate change. Australia  pledged to spend more money  to help developing Pacific neighbouring nations to fight climate change and seek an agreement on rapid cuts to global emissions. \"Cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. \"And achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially in developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life.\" Australia will double its climate commitment to its Pacific and South East Asian partners to $2 billion until 2025. Mr Morrison said international collaboration, partnerships and high-integrity international carbon offsets were critical in achieving net zero emissions globally.

{"id":null,"body":"The Democrats have proposed a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint which seeks to combat climate change and expand Medicare alongside infrastructure spending. A sweeping $3.5 trillion spending deal is being pushed by Democrats looking to pour money into combating climate change and expanding Medicare alongside a bipartisan infrastructure deal. On Tuesday high-profile Democrats unveiled a multi-trillion budget blueprint which focused on addressing party priorities by pairing them with a Republican backed infrastructure plan. The bipartisan proposal includes $600 billion in funding for key public services such as roads, bridges, airports and broadband but excludes spending on climate change and Medicare. The new proposal will contain massive spending and tax increases on multiple programs Republicans oppose \u2013 with the details yet to be hashed out. Democrats plan to push the proposal through congress using a process known as budget reconciliation which will render the filibuster useless. The filibuster is a political procedure which allows United States members of Congress to delay or prevent a decision being made on a piece of legislation. To successfully move the package and the ensuing reconciliation bill through the Senate Democrats will need every single member of their party and aligned independents to vote together. Republic opposition to the bill appears to be strong and it is not yet known whether all 50 Democrat lawmakers have thrown their support behind the multi-trillion-dollar measure. More progressive members of the party originally put forward a $6 trillion plan which was cut down by moderates to $3.5 trillion. US President Joe Biden is scheduled to host his first in-person lunch with the Democrat caucus on Wednesday where he is expected to rally support for the plan. The agreement on the budget blueprint was reached under the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and 11 Democrat Senators who sit on the Budget Committee. Mr Schumer said the party was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the proposal which seeks to deliver President Biden\u2019s $4 trillion economic plan. \u201cWe know we have a long road to go. We\u2019re going to get this done for the sake of making average Americans\u2019 lives a whole lot better.\u201d Democrat moderates such as Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and progressives such as Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont have pledged to support the bill. \u201cThis is, in our view, a pivotal moment in American history,\u201d Mr Sanders despite leading the charge for a far larger package. Only the broad outline of the bill has been released while specific details regarding how the package will be paid for remain notably absent. The budget blueprint is expected to protect small business from tax hikes and expand Medicare to include funding for dental, vision and hearing services.

He spoke just hours before Mr Morrison unveiled a plan to achieve net zero by 2050 which has been labelled \u201cweak\u201d and \u201clast minute\u201d by political opponents. The Prime Minister said the new strategy will have no cost to jobs and continue his \u201ctechnology not taxes\u201d approach. British naturalist Sir David Attenborough warned world leaders it would be too late to tackle climate change if  #COP26  does not succeed. He said the richer nations had a moral responsibility to act  https:\/\/t.co\/08DrMq2bs7   pic.twitter.com\/0eUbPkJkbQ Australia's last-minute commitment before next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate summit in Glasgow is built on hope for new technology, and little else. https:\/\/t.co\/JfNb9diYys Speaking to the BBC Mr Attenborough criticised \u201cpeople in Australia\u201d who claimed climate change driven disasters like fires were \u201cone-off\u201d events. The famed environmentalist said richer nations had a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to take swift action to ensure \u201creally catastrophic\u201d outcomes were not realised. \u201cWhat climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, and that we have been reporting upon, you and I both, is the case \u2013 we were not causing false alarms,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every day that goes by in which we don\u2019t do something about it is a day wasted and things are being made worse. Scott Morrison says \"you're not the boss of me\" while begrudgingly rolling out the weakest climate pledge of the world's richest countries. https:\/\/t.co\/ZdMo8SOLbC \u201cThere are still people in Australia who say \u2018no, no, no, no, of course it\u2019s very unfortunate that there was that forest fire that absolutely demolished, incinerated that village, but it\u2019s a one-off\u2019. Mr Attenborough said there was an impulse to dismiss the problem if the short term cost of a solution was significant. \u201cParticularly if it\u2019s going to cost money in the short term, the temptation is to deny the problem and pretend it\u2019s not there.\u201d \u201cBut every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects.\u201d Mr Morrison responded to the criticism on Wednesday, pointing out emissions were down and Australia was \u201cgetting results\u201d. Asked whether he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Mr Attenborough\u2019s strong words accusing the federal government of prioritising the economy over the planet, Mr Morrison said he was not. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed at all when it comes to doing what is right by Australia,\u201d Mr Morrison said on Sunrise \u201cWe are getting results. We are getting it done. Our emissions are down.\u201d Mr Morrison also said he \u201crejects\u201d criticism from Australian tech magnate Michael Cannon-Brooks who joined the media chorus against the Coalition\u2019s climate action labelling it \u201cinaction\u201d. \u201cWe have already achieved more than 20 per cent emissions reductions and grown alchemy by 45 per cent,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cSo we\u2019re getting this done. They might like how we\u2019re doing it but we are getting results,\u201d Mr Morrison said. Great to see Australia commit to reach net zero by 2050. They join a growing club - over 80% of the global economy is now committed to net zero. I look forward to welcoming  @ScottMorrisonMP  to Glasgow next week to deliver a successful  @COP26 . \u201cAustralia\u2019s actions and results speak more than the words of others and we are getting it done.\u00a0 Australians wanted it done but they don\u2019t want to throw their livelihoods away.\u201d The plan has been criticised by Labor as lacking ambition after it was revealed the Morrison government had left its 2030 target from the 2019 election unchanged. Despite the release of new modelling which suggests Australia could achieve a 35 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, the Coalition locked in a 26-28 per cent reduction in emissions. But the response has not been all negative with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulating Australia on joining the \u201cclub\u201d and welcoming Mr Morrison to next week\u2019s Glasgow Summit. Global pressure to commit to a net zero target ramped up after the\u00a0UN published its\u00a0climate\u00a0report in August, urging the world to make drastic cuts to greenhouse emissions this decade.

{"id":null,"body":"In a surprise move North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has raised concerns over \u201cabnormal climate\u201d patterns resulting in a devastating cycle of droughts and floods causing food supply issues. North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-Un has clamped down on climate change in flurry of tough measures addressing \u201cabnormal\u201d weather patterns as his nation suffers through a crippling food shortage. Officials have been tasked with improving the nation\u2019s flood management infrastructure which has come under increasing pressure due to droughts followed by typhoon rains. Vital crops were badly damaged in 2020, resulting in North Korea dispensing emergency reserves of rice usually held for wartime crises. The desperate situation has been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic which curtailed vital imports from China. Speaking to ruling party members on Thursday, Mr Kim said the danger presented by climate change had increased in recent years and called for \u201curgent action\u201d. \"Disastrous weather is getting ever more pronounced worldwide and our country is also lying vulnerable to its danger,\u201d Kim Jong-Un said. He ordered officials to implement crisis control measures such as \"river improvement, afforestation for erosion control, dike maintenance and tide embankment projects.\" North Korea\u2019s economy has been hard-hit by international sanctions, border closures and lockdown measures imposed across the globe to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The nation has not reported any coronavirus cases but sealed its borders and imposed lockdowns which has impacted imports from China. The United Nations estimated in July North Korean natural disasters had reduced food supplies by 860,000 tons and warned the country would face shortages from August to October. Mr Kim has acknowledged the situation is becoming \u201ctense\u201d and rigorously told officials at the meeting to \u201cattain without fail\u201d the grain production goal for 2021 by mobilising the workforce. Citizens of North Korea \u2013 particularly prisoners, soldiers and students \u2013 are forced by the government to take part in large public projects. Harsh labour on farms, mines and construction sites are regularly carried out by what the government claims is a \u201cvolunteer-led\u201d workforce, HRW senior researcher Lina Yoon wrote. The senior researcher also claimed refusal to work could be punished with torture or a prison sentence. Despite major food shortages Mr Kim told state media epidemic prevention was of \u201cparamount importance\u201d and restrictions would not be \u201cloosened\u201d.

{"id":null,"body":"Prime Minister Scott Morrison will face pressure from the rest of the world after the first seven-page draft of the climate deal called for countries, such as Australia, to \"accelerate the phasing out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies\". The United Nations climate agency have released their first draft where they have noted current pledges by countries are \"insufficient\" in responding to the worsening global warming impacts in developing countries. The  seven-page proposal , published on Wednesday morning (local time), has urged countries to \"revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determine contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022\". The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, set the goal of avoiding the increase in the average global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and limiting the goal of not exceeding 1.5 degrees. Australia is among a number of countries that have been told to set more ambitious 2030 emissions and reduction targets. Prime Minister Scott Morrison will come under further scrutiny with the paper calling to \"accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels\". Last week he refused to join nearly 200 countries and organisations in pledging to phase out coal power by the end of the decade. The commitment was made at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow with 190 countries signing the Global Goal to Clean Power Transition Statement which will see them end investment in new coal power generation both domestically and overseas. Australia is one of several coal-dependent nations who did not commit to the pledge, along with China, India and the United States. Prior to leaving to Scotland for the conference, Mr Morrison said Australia's policy was \"very clear\" in that it would \"not be engaged in those sort of mandates and bans\" on coal. \"It won't be the Australia government's policy. All countries are coming at this task from different places, their economies are different. And as a global community, we've got to understand that,\" he said. \"Developing countries have different challenges to those in Europe. Indeed, Australia's economy in the shape and form of our economy is very different to many of those as well.\" In February 2017, Mr Morrison, who was the Treasurer at the time, famously brought a lump of coal into parliament during question time saying it \"delivered prosperity\" to Australia. \"This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, it won't hurt you,\" he said. \"It's coal that has ensured for over 100 years that Australia has enjoyed an energy competitive advantage that has delivered prosperity to Australian businesses and ensured Australian industry has been able to remain competitive on a global market. \"Those opposite have an ideological, pathological fear of coal. \"There is no word for coalaphobia but that's the malady that afflicts those opposite, but it's that malady that is afflicting the jobs in the towns and industries and indeed this country because of their pathological, ideological opposition to coal being an important part of our sustainable and more certain energy future.\" The climate report has also calls for \"just transitions to net zero emissions\" and stresses the important of scaled-up financial resources, taking into accounts the needs of developing countries vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Negotiators from close to 200 countries will need to strike a deal before the summit ends on Friday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged the good work being done at the conference but there was \"still a huge amount to do\". He said it was \"very frustrating to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back for signing that promissory note in Paris quietly edging towards default now that vulnerable nations and future generations are demanding payment here and now.\" Mr Johnson said leaders have \"no excuse\" after hearing pleas from nations, particularly smaller ones, who are being threatened by global warming.

{"id":null,"body":"Jack Houghton, Sky News Digital Editor The United Nations organisation dictating the world\u2019s climate change policy has been infiltrated by dangerous activists masquerading as scientists. Authors who wrote the latest IPCC report are using Twitter to advocate for children to skip school and protest anyone who takes issue with handing trillions of dollars to the UN to satisfy wealth redistribution goals. Other \u201cscientists\u201d are advocating for the government to become involved in \u201cpopulation control\u201d to stem rising climate emissions. These radical ideas are not just dangerous they are devoid of scientific research to support the policy conclusions. Science perverted into policy advice which simply becomes opinion. Professor Chukwumerije Okereke from the UK\u2019s University of Reading was a consultant on the latest report into climate change. He is advocating for the government to ban people from having children to fight climate change. \u201cSome African governments don\u2019t like to talk about population control, but it is absolutely vital that we educate our governments and our men and women on sensible approaches to population control. \u201cOtherwise it will be hard to achieve many of the sustainable development goals.\u201d This same IPCC scientist wants the western world to give African countries \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d and has supported mass protests \u201cdemanding climate emergency action\u201d. \u201cAlthough climate finance to Africa has grown over the years, the finance gap remains in the order of trillions of dollars,\u201d he wrote earlier this year. \u201cFinally several governments in Europe are now beginning to make some positive noises about increasing climate action. This shows the power of recent mass protests demanding climate emergency action. Power to the people!!!\u201d In his mind, climate change is solely the fault of the evil western colonisers who he blames for the rise of technology, and by proxy emissions. \u201cClimate justice can provide opportunities for African governments to extract better deals from the industrialised countries who have so far refused to take full responsibility for their contribution to global warming,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, using his smartphone and the internet which were both developed by western capitalistic principles. But note the phrase \u201cfull responsibility\u201d.  These are the utterances of a revolutionary, not a disciplined scientist we should be relying on. Mr Okereke has proven he is unable to separate ideology from his science so he should be banned from the IPCC process. Unfortunately, nearly every scientist working for this fund makes similar claims on their personal social media profiles. The institution has been compromised and the policy conclusions it draws should simply be ignored.  This is simply a socialist wealth redistribution scheme and has nothing to do with lowering emissions. Another senior IPCC author involved in the latest report was Michael Grubb from the University College London. The \u201cclimate change\u201d professor tweeted a photo of his son holding a placard at a climate protest with the words \u201cProud of my son Arthur at the school climate strike today in Cambridge \u2013 huge turnout\u201d. This protest was calling for a complete abandonment of fossil fuels and reforming the global energy market \u2013 including Australia\u2019s. And Mr Grubb used his child as a pawn in that argument before going back to doing his independent \u201cscience\u201d. Mr Grubb\u2019s ideology also creeps into his work. He runs an academic climate change website which calls again for wealth redistribution to poorer nations blaming the evil west. And despite the Chinese government refusing to cut back on emissions \u2013 which are expected to increase by 2912 mega tones by 2030 \u2013 his researchers continue to defend the dictatorship. \u201cBy pledging to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, the latest in a series of deals struck with the US a few months before the Paris Agreement was adopted, China asserted itself as a climate diplomatic power,\u201d his researchers wrote in an article. Grubb is praising China for refusing to reduce emissions, but he is selling it as a win because China has promised to reassess its financial position in 2030. \u201cChina can take pride in these remarkable achievements,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cYet more obligations and higher expectations come along with the new status of green power China now claims for itself.\u201d Yes, communist China should be proud. It has simultaneously become the world\u2019s largest polluter and earnt gushing praise from IPCC scientists for doing absolutely nothing. It truly is a political masterstroke. The fact those who are attempting to dictate Australia\u2019s climate response would make this argument is absurd. If Mr Grubb had any integrity, he would be seeking to lobby the nation responsible for pumping 13000 megatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. But then, of course, that would be contrary to his narrative that the evil west is to blame for every problem in existence.

The extraordinary statements have been published in a document by the Green Climate Fund \u2013 an international organisation with a $10.3 billion budget (US). Australia gifted it $200 million (AUD) in 2015 but Prime Minister Scott Morrison axed further contributions after questions were raised about funds being sent to China, the single largest CO2 emitter in the world. \u201cWhile COVID-19 is causing untold suffering, the international response to this unprecedented health crisis in modern times offers an opportunity to direct finances towards bolstering climate action. GCF will continue to make critical investments in climate-resilient water resource management, health care facilities, agriculture and livelihoods \u2013 all of which are essential to subduing and overcoming the pandemic,\u201d the organisation wrote in an official public update. \u201cSimilarly, we will step up our efforts to catalyse green investment to relaunch economies on low-emission, climate-resilient trajectories. \u201cThe Green Climate Fund is confident that only a united approach \u2013 bringing together determined efforts and innovation \u2013 will provide lasting solutions to both the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.\u201d The Green Climate Fund went on to suggest that climate change was a threat comparable to COVID-19 which has killed 165,000 people, infected millions more and ravaged global economies. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and the global response required to stem it shows the importance of acting together to solve unparalleled threats to people and our planet,\u201d the GCF said. \u201cThe far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 are a stark reminder of the catastrophic implications the world faces if we don\u2019t.\u201d A Sky News special investigation last year revealed the GCF squandered $3.7 million flying staff around the world for climate change conferences. The bureaucrats which run the GFC were paid $65 million in wages \u2013 a figure that has been steadily ballooning each year. It can also now be revealed that the fund sent $157.5 million (AUD) to China in December despite the country planning on increasing emissions by several thousand mega tonnes of CO2 by 2030. China escaped having to pay a cent towards the climate change fund by hanging on to its \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d status even though it is a global superpower with the world\u2019s second largest economy.

Anthony Albanese has clashed with 2GB\u2019s Ray Hadley over the Solomon Islands security agreement with China, climate change, boat turnbacks, and bullying allegations levelled against several women in his leadership team. The Opposition leader, who remains in isolation at his Sydney residence due to COVID-19, sounded croaky as he kicked off the third week of the Federal Election campaign with the talkback radio host on Tuesday. The fiery interview quickly turned to the recent suggestion by the Labor Party that the Coalition\u2019s \u201cnegligent attitude\u201d towards climate change led the Solomon Islands to  sign a security pact with China last week .

Hadley interrupted immediately saying Mr Albanese was the one who pointed to climate change, but the Labor leader said it was the Pacific Islands Forum members, along with Australia who signed the Boe Declaration in 2018. \u201cThey say climate change, in their statements, when the Pacific including Australia have got together, guess what they have to say, they say consistently, that climate change is the number one issue,\u201d Mr Albanese said. \u201cNow, the Pacific leaders in the declaration said this, \u2018we affirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security, wellbeing for the people of the pacific and our commitment to progressing implementation of the Paris agreement\u2019.\" He also referenced the video footage of Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison, who was Social Services Minister at the time, joking about rising sea levels alongside prime minister at the time, Tony Abbott. \u201cFor them (Pacific Island nations) it is a major threat. It is a massive priority. And it\u2019s a fact,\u201d Mr Albanese said. Hadley went on to suggest Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare would be \u201cdriving around in a Ferrari in some South American country in another five years\u201d with reports politicians on the island took bribes from Beijing. \"The point is Australia has been the security partner of choice and this has happened under our nose and Scott Morrison hasn\u2019t bothered to pick up the phone to Prime Minister Sogavare,\" he said. Mr Albanese said the White House sent a \"really serious delegation\" to the Solomons Islands, led by US National Security Council Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, Kurt Campbell, but Australia failed to intervene earlier to stop the deal. But Hadley pointed to the fact the Solomon Islands still ended up signing the deal despite the meeting with top US officials. Mr Albanese then declared there would be \u201cno carbon tax, ever\u201d under his government. Hadley repeated his statement before he asked him to say it again so he \u201chad it on record\u201d. \u201cWe will have no carbon tax,\u201d the Opposition leader said. \u201cThere will be no carbon tax, ever.\u201d The pair then came head-to-head over boat turnbacks and Operation Sovereign Borders, where Mr Albanese declared he would support the idea if he was elected as Prime Minister. \u201cWe support boat turnbacks, we support offshore processing, we support settlement in third countries,\u201d he said. Hadley, who played boat horn sounds, then questioned the Labor leader what visa someone arriving on a boat would receive. \u201cThere\u2019s a boat off northern Australia, it can\u2019t be turned back so they come to Australia,\u201d he said. Mr Albanese interjected, saying \u201cthey won\u2019t come to Australia\u201d. \u201cWhere will they go?\u201d Hadley asked, to which Mr Albanese replied, \u201cWell Nauru, offshore\u201d. Hadley told the Opposition Leader \u201cgood luck\u201d as the pair continued to talk over each other. \u201cWe will have the same policy as the government has,\u201d Mr Albanese said. The radio host disagreed with the Labor leader\u2019s assertion, replying \u201cno you won\u2019t\u201d and flagging again that the government has temporary protection visas. \u201cThey will not be allowed to settle in Australia,\u201d Mr Albanese said. He was quizzed towards the end of the interview whether he would ask an anti-corruption commission - if it was established - to investigate the bullying allegations by three of his senior ministers towards Senator Kimberley Kitching before her death. Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally, and Katy Gallagher have been accused of being Labor \"mean girls\" who ostracised and humiliated Ms Kitching during her time in parliament before she died from a suspected heart attack in March. \u201cI won\u2019t ask them to investigate anything, that\u2019s the whole point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be independent and won\u2019t be controlled by politics. That\u2019s as it should be.\u201d Hadley asked whether, if he was elected as prime minister, would stand up to denounce workplace bullying that he alleges Ms Kitching was subjected to. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that characterisation that you\u2019ve just given,\" Mr Albanese said. \u201cI think Kimberley Kitching\u2019s death was far too early and is a tragedy.\u201d The trio released a joint statement a week after Ms Kitching's death saying the allegations were \"untrue\" and \"other assertions which have been made are similarly inaccurate.\" The chat ended more calmer with Hadley thanking Mr Albanese for his time while he was battling COVID at his Marrickville home. He will continue his campaign trail virtually and over the phone before he is expected to return in person later this week, providing he tests negative. To join the conversation, please\r\n  log in.

{"id":null,"body":"Mark Latham says Labor candidate Dan Repacholi has told an \"absolute lie\" in claiming coal mines will be exempt from the safeguarding mechanism adding that Labor is preaching different climate policies to different electorates. New South Wales One Nation leader Mark Latham has taken aim at Labor\u2019s climate change policy saying the federal opposition is \u201cwalking both sides of the street\u201d. The comments follow the Sky News Peoples\u2019 Forum: Hunter on Wednesday where Labor\u2019s candidate for the Hunter Dan Repacholi announced no mines in the region would be affected by the party\u2019s safeguard mechanism to reduce emissions. Speaking exclusively to Sky News Australia host Peta Credlin, Mr Latham slammed the Labor party for lying to miners in the Hunter after Mr Repacholi\u2019s announcement contradicted Labor climate change spokesperson Chris Bowen\u2019s recent comments on the safeguard mechanism. \u201cToday the Labor candidate Dan Repacholi basically put out the Labor lie to say that the coal mines in the Hunter would be exempted from the safeguard mechanism that is basically,\u201d he said.

Mr Latham launched into Mr Repacholi for spruiking a campaign to Hunter voters which differed from the climate policy announced by Mr Bowen. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute lie,\u201d he said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t get away with it they\u2019re walking both sides of the street in inner Sydney and Melbourne they\u2019re saying they\u2019re climate change agenda and in the Hunter Valley they\u2019re saying the mines won\u2019t be treated any worse than mines in China and Indonesia, now that\u2019s dirty coal.\u201d Labor has faced questions over its climate policy which claims the 215 biggest carbon emitters will be covered by the safeguard mechanism. The 215 companies would be subject to caps on the amount of carbon allowed to be emitted forcing them to cut their pollution using options including clean technology, emissions offsets, emissions capture or by purchasing expensive carbon credits. Despite Mr Repacholi\u2019s announcement on Wednesday Mr Bowen recently told Channel Nine Labor \"will require the 215 emitters to reduce their emissions to net-zero by 2050 and that is what the Business Council has asked to happen\". When asked if coal mines such as those in the Hunter were included, Mr Bowen replied \"yes\". However on Wednesday Sky News Australia's Laura Jayes, who hosted the forum, put it to Mr Repacholi: \"How many mines in the Hunter will be affected by Labor's safeguard mechanism?\". \"No mines will be affected in the Hunter by our safeguard mechanism. All we have to do is compete and be the same as what our counterparts are doing overseas,\" he responded. Mr Latham again took aim at Mr Repacholi for claiming the coal mines in the Hunter would not be any worse off financially than their overseas competitors who were not subject to safeguarding mechanisms and climate policies. \u201cI think ten years ago the workers sorted out the truth that Labor\u2019s more interested in carbon reduction and climate change agenda than saving coal jobs in the Hunter Valley and you can\u2019t have both,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Repacholi policy announced today is actually an increase in emissions under the Labor climate change policy rather than the 43 per cent reduction in just eight years\u2019 time and net zero in 2050.\u201d Mr Latham then turned his attacks onto Mr Bowen and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese for giving voters in different electorates different messages. \u201cChris Bowen and Anthony Albanese should be asked about this you can\u2019t walk both sides of the street, you can\u2019t lie to the coal miners in the Hunter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that Labor wants to get rid of those coal mining jobs but to lie to these people on the way out about Labor policy is just completely reprehensible.\u201d To join the conversation, please\r\n log in.

Offer ends 31 October, 2022 In a press conference after the meeting, she said the conversation with Mr Albanese was \"very free flowing and productive\" and covered key topics of concerns. \"There are no two countries that I can think of that have a closer relationship than ours and when I say that we are family, I mean it very sincerely,\" she said. \"They were very free-flowing and productive talks today and we covered, as the Prime Minister has said, a wide range of topics and in my mind, the discussions really represented the opportunity for a reset and I felt that in the dialogue that we had today. \"We agreed that both our countries are stronger when we work together and the number of areas in which we have the opportunity to do that are significant.\" Ms Ardern was then questioned by Sky News' political reporter Trudy McIntosh if she welcomed the Australian leader's emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030. The mother-of-one said she was focused on getting \"our own house in order\" and flagged domestic issues would always be a matter for its own government. \"Whilst that is a matter for them, of course, New Zealand is heartened and welcomes the position expressed by the new government here in Australia because it is good for our region and good for the world when we work collaboratively on this extraordinary challenge,\" she said. Ms Ardern stressed it was \"incumbent on us\" to do our bit as the concerns of climate is considered the number one threat in the Pacific region.. \"I know with regards to New Zealand we have a lot more to do, but we welcome being joined on that journey by Australia,\" she added. McIntosh then posed to Mr Albanese on whether his 43 per cent emissions goal was at risk due to another blow-out in the $5.1 billion Snowy Hydro project. The construction phase of the project - which has been delayed by 19 months - means it will not start producing electricity until later this decade. He said the slow roll out came as no surprise as the former Coalition was \"always about the announcement, never about the delivery\". \"And we see that with Snowy Hydro and, indeed, Snowy Hydro wasn't due to be plugged into the grid when it was ready to be opened, according to the previous government's timetable,\" Mr Albanese said. \"We need to fix transmission in this country to bring it up to the 21st century.\" Mr Albanese added his meetings with international leaders have moved Australia from \"out of the naughty corner\" after nine years and suggested one of the consequences of that was the energy crisis being felt by household along the east coast. The Labor leader suggested it was the failure of the previous government to deliver and invest in renewables that has led to the energy crunch. \"And the result of that is pressure on cost of living, less jobs, less economic activity as a result of the failure to invest, which is a direct result of the fact there's been no policy certainty when it comes to climate change and what is necessary,\" he said. Mr Albanese was also questioned about New Zealand's response to China's growing influence in the Pacific where he declared the two nations are in \"lockstep\". \"I look forward to working with Prime Minister Ardern, working with our democratic neighbours. We're all a part of the Pacific. They're our partners,\" he said. The two leaders are set to meet their 16 counterparts for the Pacific Islands Forum. \"I very much look forward to working not just with New Zealand but our other Pacific partners on making sure that we defend national sovereignty ... that we look at ways in which we can increase development.\" \"But, importantly as well, the position on climate change means that when I've spoken with the leaders in the Pacific, which I have - and in coming days, I'll be meeting with the leadership of the Cook Islands as well so we are taken seriously now.\" Ardern also said she is \u201cheartened\u201d by Mr Albanese\u2019s acknowledgement of their concerns with the deportation laws under Section 501 of the Immigration Act. The Australian government previously stated the rule would not change regardless of how long a criminal had lived in the country or how strong their ties were to New Zealand. However Mr Albanese appeared to be more considerate of her concerns. \u201cWhat I heard was a real awareness of some of the issues that we have long raised,\u201d Ms Ardern said. \u201cA longstanding expectation that Australia not deport individuals who have lived in Australia for a long time and are essentially Australians. \u201cThese are not new issues in the relationship but this is a new government and so of course we want to allow the time to work through those issues and I have no doubt we'll have the opportunity to discuss them again in the near future.\u201d Mr Albanese did not directly say what action would be taken under his new government but acknowledged the \u201cvery clear message\u201d from New Zealand.

{"id":null,"body":"China creates the carbon equivalent of a new Australian economy every year as it steadily increases emissions but some climate activists want this fact demonised as misinformation. Australians shivering through the worst energy crisis in decades should not be lectured on climate policy by pseudointellectual foreign activists masquerading as academics. This week a British-based think tank, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, released a report titled Deny, Deceive, Delay, which demonised debate around climate policy and complained about the spread of \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Ironically, this is a national conversation sorely needed at a time when the Energy Minister of New South Wales is telling people there isn\u2019t enough electricity for them to use a dishwasher at night. The SDI report\u2019s findings were used by reporters at The Guardian who this week wrote with glee about Sky News Australia\u2019s supposed role in spreading these anti-orthodox views. \u201cAustralia\u2019s Sky News channel has become a central source for climate science misinformation around the world, gaining high traction among conservative social media influencers and networks, according to a report ,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe report looked at how views antagonistic to climate change action are spread around the world, how the content is created, and who is influential in spreading those views.\u201d What followed was a hyperbole-fuelled opinion piece by the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Graham Readfearn, who seems to confuse misinformation with policy viewpoints he disagrees with. Readfearn failed to provide examples of misinformation, and instead spread false narratives himself. The report attempted to coin a new phrase in the climate change debate, \u201cdiscourses of delay\u201d. Instead of being slandered as a denier you are now referred to as a \u201cdelayer\u201d if you do not agree with the specific and exact course of action sought by the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThe report identified key \u2018discourses of delay\u2019 used to undermine action on the climate crisis, particular in the lead up to and during the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021,\u201d Mr Readfearn wrote. \u201cThese included attacks on \u2018unreliable renewables\u2019 or claimed ineffectiveness of electric vehicles. Other popular themes were to point to major emitters \u2013 often China \u2013 and use their high emissions to absolve other countries of the need to act, or to argue that advocates for climate action were wealthy elites and part of a \u2018New World Order\u2019.\u201d If you note that China is the single largest emitter of C02 in the world, and responsible for 33 per cent of all carbon emissions , then this report claims you are spreading misinformation. These facts should be highly relevant to policy debates so that we can factor in what, if anything, China is doing to minimise CO2 emissions. If we as a global community fail to curtail the worsening Chinese problem, all climate reduction efforts will fail. That is what the science tells us in the clearest possible terms. Those who truly wish to see action on climate change should be beyond anger that China has abandoned its Paris Accord obligations. Or as global emissions tracking website climateactiontracker.org puts it, President Xi Jinping has \u201cseemingly completely reneged on this strategy\u201d to pursue burning more coal instead. \u201cWe estimate China\u2019s emissions have risen 3.4% to 14.1 GtCO2e in 2021 due to a large spike in energy demand as the country\u2019s pandemic recovery continues\u2014this is concerning as power consumption has been projected to rise 5\u20136% in the upcoming year,\u201d the site wrote. \u201cIn 2020\u20132021, China began toning down its outlook on coal, highlighted by President Xi Jinping when he announced that China will strictly control coal consumption until 2025 and start to gradually phase it down thereafter. By the end of 2021, however, China had seemingly completely reneged on this strategy to focus on shoring up coal (and other fossil fuels) supply off the back of energy security and shortage concerns.\u201d It is worth noting that the pace China\u2019s C02 contribution grows each year is more than Australia\u2019s entire C02 output, meaning every year China effectively creates a new carbon equivalent of Australia while we dutifully reduce our emissions in line with global commitments. And while this is happening we squabble over supply source statistics instead of being able to guarantee that Australians will be able to keep the lights on. But for the Guardian this level of nuance is lost on its writers, who for some reason fail to acknowledge the significance of the global issue. However, it was with great amusement to see that the research found The Guardian itself was one of the world\u2019s top \u201cdelayers\u201d. \u201cThe report said the Guardian was \u2018anomalous within this section, in that the articles shared were not themselves misleading or warranting factchecks, but were nonetheless used to support opposition lines of attack by cherrypicking data or adopting a \u2018culture wars\u2019 frame\u2019,\u201d The Guardian wrote. And this writer does not begrudge The Guardian stooping to culture war media feuds in its climate coverage. That is The Guardian\u2019s niche and it should be free to do so. The issue is with foreign researchers authoring a report about subjects they know nothing about. The first writer of the report was ISD Global Head of Civic Action Jennie King, whose employment history shows she has zero experience as either a journalist or climate scientist. The second was a political scientist and the third appears to be well versed in digital marketing. But despite the grossly unqualified credentials any of the trio hold related to media and science, the report contained this passage. \u201cIf a free press is uniquely important to society then it should also be subject to continual scrutiny and the highest standards of accuracy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf not, its potential to drive and amplify harm is disproportionate. This point is especially relevant for issues like climate change, where certain media outlets have been consistent vectors for laundering denial, \u2018discoursesof delay\u2019 and fossil fuel industry talking points into the mainstream. Referring back to Policy Ask 2, in cases where an outlet is itself a \u2018repeat offender\u2019, platforms must be authorised to act in line withtheir Terms of Service or Community Guidelines and minimise the impact of such content.\u201d If King believes a media outlet has used \u201ctalking points\u201d from the fossil fuel industry or engage in \u201cdelaying\u201d speech then she wants repeat offenders booted off the internet. Even The Guardian, which has been established as one of the worst \u201cdelayers\u201d, would be at risk of breaching that standard. The policy of censorship that these marketing hacks propose is truly ill-considered and would completely inhibit our ability as a society to discuss and debate energy policy as our country sees fit. Australia\u2019s biggest problem right now is energy supply and while large investments in renewable energy should form an aspect of our pathway forward, there is also certainly a place for fossil fuels. Our pace of transition and what that transition looks like practically must not become a taboo subject. You should not be shamed into thinking that viewpoint is misinformation or somehow immoral. Instead, I would like to participate in a free and robust national debate so that we never again have to tell elderly Australians they are not allowed to pack the dishwasher.

Research was also conducted on extreme weather events, Indigenous impacts, water temperatures, high emissions, poor land and water management and rising sea levels. The review found an increase in animal and plant species being listed as threatened (202 in total) and fears there will be an increase in coming years after the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfires that killed 1 billion to 3 billion animals. Australia's temperature has also warmed since the 1950s \"by a means of 1.4C on land and 1.1C in the oceans\" and marine heatwaves had led to mass coral bleaching events in the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2017 and 2020.

Greens spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young said the report showed a \"litany of environmental wreckage fuelled by climate change and years of denial and neglect\". She warned it was time to take action and consider the impact of government projects before they are approved. \u201cIf the minister is really alarmed by this report, then she will take immediate action to ensure no more critical habitat is cleared and polluting projects that are fuelling the climate crisis are stopped,\" Senator Hanson-Young added. A lack of funding and coordination between states and territories to address the issues was one of the criticisms in the report. It stressed the importance of a collaboration between federal, state and local governments to find funding and improve monitoring and reporting of ecosystems.

The Greens insisted it is too early to determine if they would support the government's climate change legislation and will push for amendments to the bill. Labor will introduce legislation when parliament resumes this month to lock in the emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

It\u2019s going to be a very long three years if no one is willing to shift.\" He detailed there are a \"number of problems\" with the legislation put forward and issued four changes he wanted to see in the bill before he would back it. \"It potentially puts a ceiling on the ambition so it means potentially if a future government wanted to lift the 43% target they might have to come back to parliament,\" Mr Bandt said. \"It doesn't contain any provisions that will stop coal and gas and also it's in many respects ... it doesn't actually compel the government to do anything.\" Mr Bandt feared the 43 per cent would be locked in under the bill and not be updated if the government or his party successfully push for a higher target. He believes the issue was a \"fixable problem\" and was willing to sit down with the government to have discussions \"without preconditions\". The Greens leader was posed whether he was willing to deal with the concerns of coal and gas projects separately to the emissions target but he argued \"they're obviously linked\" and referenced the gas projects in Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin. \"Well, they're obviously linked, right?

Treasurer Jim Chalmers echoed the sentiments during an interview with Sky News Australia's Kieran Gilbert on Sunday. \"The difficulties in our energy markets make it more urgent that we get cleaner and cheaper and more reliable energy in, not less urgent,\" he said. \"... A meaningful responsible action on climate change, which is designed to get our energy prices down and make our energy sources much more reliable in the context of extreme energy market volatility.\" He suggested the Coalition was \"always looking for an excuse to do nothing\" when it came to climate change. \"Legislating the target is international best practice, it\u2019s the best way to give our businesses and investors and broader community certainty over that target, so that\u2019s our intention to legislate it,\" Mr Chalmers added. \"If they think that we should be doing something about climate change in a responsible way then all parties in the parliament should vote for it.\" To join the conversation, please\r\n log in.

Do you hear me, all of you, do you?\" Morgan mocked. \"When did he become this miserable guy? He's so miserable. Oh I know, it's when he met Meghan. \"When you're as rankly hypocritical as Harry is. You know, preaching about climate change, using private jets all the time when he doesn't have to, is there not a point where the United Nations should avoid using people like him?\" But it's not the first time the Prince has come under fire over his travel habits. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their two children arrived in the United Kingdom on a private jet for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations last month. The outspoken environmentalists also opted to fly via private jet after attending Global Citizen Live in 2021 - an event that advocated for climate change action. In just one hour, a single private jet can emit two tonnes of carbon dioxide - the primary greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming, according to Transport and Environment. Morgan went on to add that Prince Harry's brief speech attempted to draw parallels between him finding \"freedom\" and an influential figure who spent over 27 years in prison. \"He made reference to Mandela 20 times in this brief speech, clearly trying to draw some kind of parallel between his own struggle and long walk to freedom as this great inspiring historical figure who literally spent three decades nearly in a tiny cell,\" Morgan said.

{"id":null,"body":"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has just received a significant update about one of his biggest election commitments. The Greens will support Labor\u2019s climate change bill, legislating a 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030. Greens MP Adam Bandt confirmed the party would pass the Bill through both the House and the Senate. Mr Bandt told the National Press Club while 43 per cent wasn\u2019t nearly as high a target as his party wanted, amendments to the bill ensured it was a \u201cfloor, not a ceiling\u201d. He said it was \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d that Labor had made it very clear they would not support a moratorium on new coal and gas, which the Greens had been pushing hard for. \u201cYou can\u2019t put out the fire while pouring more petrol on it. You can only end the climate wars by keeping coal and gas in the ground,\u201d Mr Bandt said. \u201cIf we hit two degrees of warming or more, and fail to meet the Paris agreement goals \u2013 which is where Labor\u2019s weak target takes us \u2013 the Great Barrier Reef will die. \u201cMore coal and gas mines will cause more floods, fires and droughts. They will increase the cost of living, destroy infrastructure, ecosystems will collapse, more species will become extinct, and more of us will die. \u201cWe are bitterly disappointed that Labor has made it so clear that they want to continue to open new coal and gas projects.\u201d Mr Bandt said the Greens had successfully secured improvements to the bill, ensuring the target could be \u201cratcheted up\u201d over time. \u201cIt is now \u2018Dutton-proofed\u2019 with a genuine floor, which means the trigger cannot go backwards,\u201d Mr Bandt said.

But today that changes. BREAKING: Labor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate change bill just passed the Senate. It makes our 43% emissions reduction target law, and puts us on track to achieve net zero by 2050. Australians want a government that takes the threat of climate change seriously. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing. \u201cThis overdue legislation will provide the energy policy and investment certainty needed to usher in economic growth and opportunity in a decarbonising global economy. \u201cThe Bills ensure a whole-of-government approach to drive down emissions and accountability through an annual update to Parliament.\u201d Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen said the legislation puts Australia on a credible path to net zero. \u201cThe passage of the Climate Change legislation sends a message to the world that Australia is serious about driving down emissions, and serious about reaping the economic opportunities from affordable renewable energy,\u201d he said. The Albanese Labor Government's bill for stronger climate targets has just passed the Senate. \u201cLegislating these targets gives certainty to investors and participants in the energy market and will help stabilise our energy system. \u201cIt also strengthens transparency and accountability through the annual climate change statement and will ensure public debate informs government decisions.\u201d Greens leader Adam Bandt had flagged the party would back the bill in both chambers, however was critical of the opening of new coal and gas projects. \u201cAt some point the massive dissonance between saying on the one hand Parliament has to take action and then on the other hand the Labor Government\u2019s going to keep opening up new coal and gas projects is going to hit home,\u201d Mr Bandt said. \u201cPeople are seeing those two things as completely incongruous and it\u2019s ultimately not a tenable position for the government.\u201d The Greens have also introduced its Climate Trigger Bill which would amend the existing Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to ensure emissions reductions are considered when governments approve new projects. The proposal would ban new coal, oil and gas developments that would emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon and require environmental assessments of projects which emit between 25,000 and 100,000 tonnes. The Greens\u2019 calls for a ban on new fossil fuel projects and the axing of the sector\u2019s subsidies comes as Australia\u2019s coal, iron ore and gas exports drove a record trade surplus.

Senator Hanson used the sh*t swear word four times and was not cut off when she called for stronger border protections from Bali in response to the spread of foot and mouth disease.

When asked if the monarch should continue his activism, the Prime Minister said: \u201cIn my view that would be appropriate. That\u2019s a matter for him, of course.\u201d \u201cI think dealing with the challenge of climate change shouldn't be seen as a political issue, it should be seen as an issue that is about humanity and about our very quality of life and survival as a world,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a big threat and King Charles has identified that for a long period of time. \u201cI think engagement in issues is very different from engagement in party political matters. That would be entirely inappropriate.\u201d The Opposition Leader took a significantly different stance on the King\u2019s political views \u2013 telling the ABC the sovereign needed to put his advocacy \u201cto one side now\u201d. Mr Dutton echoed the King\u2019s own words in his speech upon ascension and said the new role necessitated him to undertake his role fairly \u201cas the Queen did\u201d. \u201cThere's a sensible approach to it and I'm sure the King would endorse that,\u201d Mr Dutton said. \u201cThat he now moves into a different phase of his life and as he pointed out, he's been a very strong supporter of charities and different causes for most of his adult life, but he puts that to one side now, because he takes up the important role as the head of the Commonwealth and as the King. \u201cAnd as the King, he will have a responsibility to dispense his duties fairly as the Queen did. The continuity is important element of his reign. \u201cAs King, I think as the Queen conducted her business, he is there now as an impartial person, takes up that role and they obviously take it very seriously.\u201d King Charles sought to downplay concerns that he would actively campaign on certain issues, conceding he needed to step away from some of the causes and charities for which he was a patron. The monarch also said his life would \u201cof course change\u201d as he took up the new responsibilities as King. \u201cIt will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply. But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others,\u201d he said. Prior to becoming sovereign, King Charles was a key voice in the climate change and biodiversity movement. In 2020 he delivered a rousing speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland where he declared: \u201cWe simply cannot waste anymore time \u2026 the time to act is now\u201d. \u201cGlobal warming, climate change and the devastating loss of biodiversity are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced,\u201d the King said at the time.

He said his life would \u201cof course change\u201d as he took up the new responsibilities as King. \u201cIt will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others.\u201d In 2020 he delivered a rousing speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland where he declared: \u201cWe simply cannot waste anymore time \u2026 the time to act is now\u201d. \u201cGlobal warming, climate change and the devastating loss of biodiversity are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced,\u201d the King said at the time.

Barnaby Joyce\u2019s claim global warming has been \u201cfixed\u201d because it was bucketing down rain in regional NSW has been challenged by Sunrise host Nat Barr. The former deputy prime minister appeared on the morning show from a dreary looking Danglemah, battling to keep himself dry as it rained cats and dogs. \u201cGreat weather for ducks, trout, worms, and I\u2019m going to get the hell out of here as soon as you are finished,\u201d he joked. But it was a comment in response to a question about soft plastic recycling that raised the Sunrise host\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cWe've solved global warming, we\u2019ve solved the drought, we\u2019ve obviously fixed that problem,\u201d Mr Joyce said, looking around at the downpour. \u201cNot really,\u201d Ms Barr deadpanned in response. \u201cBecause global warming actually creates rain, but we will talk about that next week.\u201d Her response was met with an audible groan from Mr Joyce. Ms Barr had asked the Nationals MP why Australia had only been recycling 16 per cent of plastics over the past four years. He replied by insisting you can\u2019t talk about recycling without talking about coal-fired power stations and nuclear energy. \u201cOne of the things about it, of course, is (that it) costs money to recycle. Like all manufacturing \u2026 requires energy, requires power,\u201d Mr Joyce said. \u201cIf we keep devoiding (sic) our nation of the capacity to produce baseload power, shutting down coal fired power stations, not wanting to talk about nuclear power \u2026 then you're not going to have manufacturing and means you\u2019re not gonna have recycling. \u201cYou just gotta be a realist. Gotta get cheaper energy.\u201d His comments come after the sensational collapse of Australia\u2019s largest soft plastic recycling scheme was revealed last week amid revelations of secret stockpiling.

The report found some burns were not conducted near town centres because smoke haze was thought too much of an inconvenience. Mr Morrow said while the inquiry\u2019s recommendations surrounding hazard reduction should be welcomed, climate modelling is a waste of time. \u201cModelling of future climate change is not going to save one house,it\u2019s not going to save one life, it\u2019s not going to do anything to prevent bushfires\u201d he said. We need to get rid of the green obsession with not doing hazard reduction burns and the other bit of it has to be that people need to be allowed to clear bush and brush outside their own homes to create their own firebreaks.\u201d ","headline":"Climate change modeling is not going to do anything to stop bushfires","article_name":"eb7ba32851370708f124cdc20bbcd6db","article_url":"https:\/\/www.skynews.com.au\/opinion\/outsiders\/climate-change-modeling-is-not-going-to-do-anything-to-stop-bushfires\/video\/eb7ba32851370708f124cdc20bbcd6db","date_published":"2020-08-09 07:18:26","article_length":1251,"date_uploaded":"2022-12-11T23:44:00.773223","article_start_url":"https:\/\/www.skynews.com.au\/opinion\/outsiders\/climate-change-modeling-is-not-going-to-do-anything-to-stop-bushfires\/video\/eb7ba32851370708f124cdc20bbcd6db","source":"skyau"}

The extraordinary statements have been published in a document by the Green Climate Fund \u2013 an international organisation with a $10.3 billion budget (US). Australia gifted it $200 million (AUD) in 2015 but Prime Minister Scott Morrison axed further contributions after questions were raised about funds being sent to China, the single largest CO2 emitter in the world. \u201cWhile COVID-19 is causing untold suffering, the international response to this unprecedented health crisis in modern times offers an opportunity to direct finances towards bolstering climate action. GCF will continue to make critical investments in climate-resilient water resource management, health care facilities, agriculture and livelihoods \u2013 all of which are essential to subduing and overcoming the pandemic,\u201d the organisation wrote in an official public update. \u201cSimilarly, we will step up our efforts to catalyse green investment to relaunch economies on low-emission, climate-resilient trajectories. \u201cThe Green Climate Fund is confident that only a united approach \u2013 bringing together determined efforts and innovation \u2013 will provide lasting solutions to both the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.\u201d The Green Climate Fund went on to suggest that climate change was a threat comparable to COVID-19 which has killed 165,000 people, infected millions more and ravaged global economies. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and the global response required to stem it shows the importance of acting together to solve unparalleled threats to people and our planet,\u201d the GCF said. \u201cThe far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 are a stark reminder of the catastrophic implications the world faces if we don\u2019t.\u201d A Sky News special investigation last year revealed the GCF squandered $3.7 million flying staff around the world for climate change conferences. The bureaucrats which run the GFC were paid $65 million in wages \u2013 a figure that has been steadily ballooning each year. It can also now be revealed that the fund sent $157.5 million (AUD) to China in December despite the country planning on increasing emissions by several thousand mega tonnes of CO2 by 2030. China escaped having to pay a cent towards the climate change fund by hanging on to its \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d status even though it is a global superpower with the world\u2019s second largest economy. China\u2019s failure to contribute to the fund led to US President Donald Trump withdrawing from the deal, clawing back billions. However, funds Australians contributed still in part went towards financing a major antistructure project in Shandong \u2013 one of the biggest polluting cities in the world which has a $1.1 trillion GDP (US).

{"id":null,"body":"Labor has spent several months blaming the devastation of Australia\u2019s deadly bushfires on the Coalition\u2019s supposed climate change inaction. For those who view politics through a cursory lens it would appear Labor were the ones pushing for tough emissions reductions measures. But in a trainwreck interview for Anthony Albanese, which aired on Sky News this morning, the party\u2019s hypocrisy has been exposed. Mr Albanese has no climate policies. No emissions reductions targets at all. The Coalition will reduce emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 using 2005 levels as a baseline. Mr Albanese and Labor have no counter to that figure and the opportunistic Labor leader has awkwardly revealed he has no plans to produce one. Not having climate change targets of their own shows Labor is just using the issue for short-term gain. Mr Albanese argues the science is settled. If that is the case then he should have no problems producing a policy solution for climate change. If the science wont change between now and the next election it doesn\u2019t matter when Labor\u2019s plan is released. Unless of course he cares more about votes than saving the planet. \u201cThe climate is changing \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing the consequences right now,\u201d Mr Albanese wrote on Twitter today. \u201cOur natural environment is one of our most precious assets. It must be protected.\u201d Empty, hollow rhetoric which solves nothing. For a party which claims to follow the science its sloganeering is curiously devoid of practical solutions. Despite what the feral left will say, this writer accepts the findings contained in IPCC reports. The dispute is about how a country strikes a balance between energy reform by minimising economic damage and maximising environmental impact. It could be argued that maximum emissions reduction impact would be gained from scrapping the Paris Agreement which allows China to increase its emissions infinitely from 13,000 mega tonnes of CO2 today to an anticipated 16,000 mega tonnes in 2030. If Australia eliminated all emissions today it would wipe 530 mega tonnes off the global map. The Paris Agreement, what the world holds up as the solution to climate change, allows China to create the equivalent of five Australian economies in the next decade. Anthony Albanese knows this and he knows the solution to the issue will not be decided by reducing domestic geo-centric emissions in Australia. He knows how damaging Labor\u2019s war on coal was at the last election and he is attempting to play both sides. He also knows that one of the most devastating moments of the campaign trail came when Bill Shorten refused to reveal how much a 45 per cent emissions reduction target would cost the economy. When it was revealed by economist Brian Fisher that the policy would cost $264 billion and kill 167,000 jobs the election result was sealed. Why would people vote for a party who would sacrifice so much to achieve so little? A much smarter solution is to create the technologies which will one day replace fossil fuels and pressure the world\u2019s largest emitters to agree to emissions reduction targets. Which is why the Coalition is probing 100 new technologies to invest in like in hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium production, biofuels and waste-to-energy. If Australia can reduce emissions by 26 per cent in the next decade so can a superpower like China. And any suggestions from Labor that Australia should influence China by leading by example are completely puerile. President Xi Jinping is an evil dictator who is keeping hundreds and thousands of Muslims in re-education slave camps and he will not be swayed by a nice gesture of morality. He will only be swayed by economic sanctions. But Labor has been completely silent about this reality. If Mr Albanese does not start displaying some honestly about the issue he risks throwing away any chance of being elected. In the interview with Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell he could neither throw his support behind the Adani coalmine or criticise it. Instead, he disassociated himself from it all together, repeatedly referring to it as being a private sector project, insinuating government should not get involved. He then went on to talk about how important coal was for Australia. \u201cPeople in Queensland and everywhere else know, who are involved in the industry, knows that the industry is continuing,\u201d Mr Albanese said. \u201cIf you gave got a 50 per cent renewable energy target, by definition there is 50 per cent coming from fossil fuels. \u201cSo, let\u2019s be realistic there about what the framework is domestically and internationally. Of course, there will continue to be coal exports; I have made that very clear.\u201d Mr Albanese screams about climate change one moment then spruiks coal the next. He knows Queenslanders will not tolerate another war on coal. Playing both sides is a dangerous game and hypocrisy is a very poisonous chalice to drink from.

{"id":null,"body":"Sky News Digital Editor Jack Houghton Hollywood hypocrisy reached new levels of absurdity this week when Pamela Anderson \u2013 who is in town to film motoring industry commercials \u2013 thought it appropriate to lecture Australians about climate change and their diets. Activists rejoiced when the Baywatch star pressured the Queensland Government to ban meat at official functions and linked the latest deadly bushfires directly to climate change. \u201cAs you\u2019ve already noted, the science is clear: climate change has played a key role in the severity of this year\u2019s bushfires,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cJust as your government is surely working on emissions-saving energy and transport policies, you could lead by example by implementing a climate-friendly vegan food policy for government functions, along with transitioning the menu at Sometimes Strangers\u2019 Restaurant at Parliament House to an all-vegan one.\u201d Australia thanks you for your insights Professor Anderson. Now could you please cash your check from Ultra Tune and hop back home on your fuel-guzzling plane. While in the air perhaps think about the hypocrisy of accepting money from a motoring company while flying around the world on carbon-producing planes. The discourse on this topic has already been perverted by activists who are using the deaths and tragedy of bushfires to propagate their political goals. We don\u2019t need washed up Hollywood hacks to profit from virtue signalling while we are still mourning as a nation. Not that Australia\u2019s activists mind. They happily promote Professor Anderson and requote her flawed science and inaccurate data to call for absurd notions like zero carbon emissions by 2030. Extremist group PETA was one organisation to cash-in on the professor\u2019s comments. It penned an article saying governments should heed her advice \u201cto save lives in the future\u201d. Yes, not listening to Professor Anderson equates to murder. These are the same activists who get their scientific advice from the 11,000 \u201cscientists\u201d who declared a climate emergency in an online petition recently. The decorated list of scientists included the names Micky Mouse, Harry Potter and his old headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Suddenly Pamela Anderson\u2019s thoughts on science seem comparatively not as absurd. So what does the science say about bushfires? Does research exist directly linking previous emissions policies to contemporary bushfires? No. There has not been a release of any scientific report analysing the cause of these specific bushfires yet. There is a very vague mention in the most recent IPCC report of the potential window for hazard reduction burns shrinking in the Asia-Pacific region but there is, as of yet, no Australian specific research directly linking this to climate change. In fact, we know a large portion of the fires were caused by arsonists so the entire argument becomes moot if people are driving around bushland starting fires on purpose. But let\u2019s look at what the actual science says and what is says specifically about Australia. In the latest IPCC report analysing bushfires authors do indeed suggest changing climate could shorten the number of days hazard reduction burns can take place. However, even if this happens, the authors only go as far to declare that it could potentially impact mitigation efforts. \u201cIn Australia, fire management will become increasingly challenging under climate change, potentially exacerbating conflicting management objectives for biodiversity conservation versus protection of property,\u201d IPCC scientists wrote. The authors also note that the phenomenon of shortening timeframes is only \u201cexpected\u201d to occur. This means the line being trotted out by The Greens and eco-activists is only a prediction of what might happen in the future. It is certainly not proof that CO2 emissions are linked to anything influencing fire season preparation right now. \u201cClimate change is expected to increase the number of days with very high and extreme fire weather with greater changes where fire is weather-constrained (most of southern Australia; many, in particular eastern and northern, parts of New Zealand) than where it is constrained by fuel load and ignitions (tropical savannahs in Australia),\u201d the authors wrote. So when people, including former Hollywood superstars, lecture you about the \u201cscience\u201d make sure you ask for their sources. Often they simply do not exist.

{"id":null,"body":"Jack Houghton, Sky News Digital Editor The United Nations organisation dictating the world\u2019s climate change policy has been infiltrated by dangerous activists masquerading as scientists. Authors who wrote the latest IPCC report are using Twitter to advocate for children to skip school and protest anyone who takes issue with handing trillions of dollars to the UN to satisfy wealth redistribution goals. Other \u201cscientists\u201d are advocating for the government to become involved in \u201cpopulation control\u201d to stem rising climate emissions. These radical ideas are not just dangerous they are devoid of scientific research to support the policy conclusions. Science perverted into policy advice which simply becomes opinion. Professor Chukwumerije Okereke from the UK\u2019s University of Reading was a consultant on the latest report into climate change. He is advocating for the government to ban people from having children to fight climate change. \u201cSome African governments don\u2019t like to talk about population control, but it is absolutely vital that we educate our governments and our men and women on sensible approaches to population control. \u201cOtherwise it will be hard to achieve many of the sustainable development goals.\u201d This same IPCC scientist wants the western world to give African countries \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d and has supported mass protests \u201cdemanding climate emergency action\u201d. \u201cAlthough climate finance to Africa has grown over the years, the finance gap remains in the order of trillions of dollars,\u201d he wrote earlier this year. \u201cFinally several governments in Europe are now beginning to make some positive noises about increasing climate action. This shows the power of recent mass protests demanding climate emergency action. Power to the people!!!\u201d In his mind, climate change is solely the fault of the evil western colonisers who he blames for the rise of technology, and by proxy emissions. \u201cClimate justice can provide opportunities for African governments to extract better deals from the industrialised countries who have so far refused to take full responsibility for their contribution to global warming,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, using his smartphone and the internet which were both developed by western capitalistic principles. But note the phrase \u201cfull responsibility\u201d. These are the utterances of a revolutionary, not a disciplined scientist we should be relying on. Mr Okereke has proven he is unable to separate ideology from his science so he should be banned from the IPCC process. Unfortunately, nearly every scientist working for this fund makes similar claims on their personal social media profiles. The institution has been compromised and the policy conclusions it draws should simply be ignored. This is simply a socialist wealth redistribution scheme and has nothing to do with lowering emissions. Another senior IPCC author involved in the latest report was Michael Grubb from the University College London. The \u201cclimate change\u201d professor tweeted a photo of his son holding a placard at a climate protest with the words \u201cProud of my son Arthur at the school climate strike today in Cambridge \u2013 huge turnout\u201d. This protest was calling for a complete abandonment of fossil fuels and reforming the global energy market \u2013 including Australia\u2019s. And Mr Grubb used his child as a pawn in that argument before going back to doing his independent \u201cscience\u201d. Mr Grubb\u2019s ideology also creeps into his work. He runs an academic climate change website which calls again for wealth redistribution to poorer nations blaming the evil west. And despite the Chinese government refusing to cut back on emissions \u2013 which are expected to increase by 2912 mega tones by 2030 \u2013 his researchers continue to defend the dictatorship. \u201cBy pledging to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, the latest in a series of deals struck with the US a few months before the Paris Agreement was adopted, China asserted itself as a climate diplomatic power,\u201d his researchers wrote in an article. Grubb is praising China for refusing to reduce emissions, but he is selling it as a win because China has promised to reassess its financial position in 2030. \u201cChina can take pride in these remarkable achievements,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cYet more obligations and higher expectations come along with the new status of green power China now claims for itself.\u201d Yes, communist China should be proud. It has simultaneously become the world\u2019s largest polluter and earnt gushing praise from IPCC scientists for doing absolutely nothing. It truly is a political masterstroke. The fact those who are attempting to dictate Australia\u2019s climate response would make this argument is absurd. If Mr Grubb had any integrity, he would be seeking to lobby the nation responsible for pumping 13000 megatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. But then, of course, that would be contrary to his narrative that the evil west is to blame for every problem in existence.

His admission comes as Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek is in Canada, trying to agree on a global blueprint to stop and reverse nature loss. Meanwhile, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen will later on Monday declare the first offshore wind zone in Australia. \u201cWe had put Australia in a position to well and truly exceed the targets that had been set in place and frankly, it was illogical - when you\u2019re clearly on track to exceed those emissions reductions targets, to not then increase the scope of those targets \u2013 there was clear headroom to do so,\u201d Senator Birmingham told ABC Radio. \u201cThe new government has done that, and that\u2019s been welcomed. \u201cAustralia would have been, and the Coalition would have been, in a stronger position had we used the headroom that was there and increased the targets given we had put the country on track to exceed those targets.\u201d In Montreal, Ms Plibersek said Australia had \u201chigh ambition\u201d when it came to protecting nature. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a domestic target of protecting 30 per cent of our land and 30 per cent of our oceans by 2030, and we think that should be a global target,\u201d she told ABC Radio. \u201cWe think we should have a target of zero new extinctions, and of course Australia wants to see this done in strong partnership with First Nations peoples. \u201cAustralia has been playing a really positive role in negotiating this final agreement \u2013 we\u2019ve really gone from environmental laggard to leader.\u201d Greens environment spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young is also in Montreal and said the world was falling short of the \u201cParis moment\u201d many had wanted for nature and for the environment. \u201cThe key crucial target around halting and stopping extinction has been watered down significantly. It\u2019s disappointing to see, this is a crucial moment,\u201d she told ABC Radio. \u201cWe know we are at a tipping point.\u201d Back in Australia, Mr Bowen, alongside Industry Minister Ed Husic and Victoria\u2019s Climate Action Minister Lily D\u2019Ambrosio will declare part of Gippsland the first offshore wind zone in the country.

{"id":null,"body":"There is a growing realisation that emissions and temperature targets are now detached from the issues of human well-being and the development of our 21st century world. For the past two centuries, fossil fuels have fuelled humanity\u2019s progress, improving standards of living and increasing the life span for billions of people. In the 21st century, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has become an international imperative for climate change mitigation, under the auspices of the UN Paris Agreement. As a result, that transition is now dominated by stringent targets to rapidly eliminate carbon dioxide emissions. However, the recent COP27 meeting in Egypt highlighted that very few of the world\u2019s countries are on track to meet their emissions reductions commitment. The desire for cleaner, more abundant, more reliable and less expensive sources of energy is universal. However, the goal of rapidly eliminating fossil fuels is at odds with the urgency of providing grid electricity to developing countries. Rapid deployment of wind and solar power has invariably increased electricity costs and reduced reliability, particularly with increasing penetration into the grid. Allegations of human rights abuses in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, where global solar voltaic supplies are concentrated, are generating political conflicts that threaten the solar power industry. Global supply chains of materials needed to produce solar and wind energy plus battery storage are spawning new regional conflicts, logistical problems, supply shortages and rising costs. The large amount of land use required for wind and solar farms, as well as transmission lines, is causing local land use conflicts in many regions. Given the apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding climate change, does the alleged urgency of reducing carbon dioxide emissions somehow trump these other considerations? Well, the climate \u2018crisis\u2019 isn\u2019t what it used to be. The COP27 has dropped the most extreme emissions scenario from consideration, which was the source of the most alarming predictions. Only a few years ago, an emissions trajectory that produced 2 to 3C warming was regarded as climate policy success. As limiting warming to 2C seems to be in reach, the goal posts were moved to limit the warming target to 1.5C. These warming targets are referenced to a baseline at the end of the 19th century; the Earth\u2019s climate has already warmed by 1.1C since 1880. In context of this relatively modest warming, climate \u2018crisis\u2019 rhetoric is now linked to extreme weather events. Attributing extreme weather and climate events to global warming can motivate a country to attempt to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels. However, we should not delude ourselves into thinking that eliminating emissions would have a noticeable impact on weather and climate extremes in the 21st century. It is very difficult to untangle the roles of natural weather and climate variability and land use from the slow creep of global warming. Looking back into the past, including paleoclimatic data, there has been more extreme weather everywhere on the planet. Thinking we can minimise severe weather by using atmospheric carbon dioxide as a control knob is a fairy tale. In particular, Australia is responsible for slightly more than 1 per cent of global carbon emissions.\u00a0 Hence, Australia\u2019s emissions have a minimal impact on global warming as well as on Australia\u2019s own climate.\u00a0 There is growing realisation that these emissions and temperature targets have become detached from the issues of human well-being and development. Yes, we need to reduce CO2 emissions over the course of the 21st century. However once we relax the faux urgency for eliminating CO2 emissions and the stringent time tables, we have time and space to envision new energy systems that can meet the diverse, growing needs of the 21st century. This includes sufficient energy to help reduce our vulnerability to surprises from extreme weather and climate events. To join the conversation, please\r\n log in.
