geologically Humans transferring billion tonnes carbon earth crust form combusted coal oil gas atmosphere year This rate carbon release probably times faster anything scientists find geological record past million years including cataclysmic volcanic eruptions linked several mass extinctions life occurred time Ocean warming coral bleachingSo perhaps hardly surprising new climate related news headline seems worse last Just recently scientists announced oceans warming much faster previously thought The amount heat absorbed seas equates energy generated exploding least three Hiroshima sized

somehow trump reality You say believe gravity step cliff going said The public wants answers Hayhoe climate scientists say important emphasize belief climate change cause Harvey Irma No scientist ever said Hayhoe said What find basically saying thing climate change exacerbates risks posed storms For example Tropical Storm Allison dumped inches rain Texas causing widespread flooding around Houston But Harvey even bigger storm fueled warmer waters Allison As result dumped inches rain region causing massive flooding stretching miles Houston Lake Charles Louisiana Are Irma Harvey affected climate change Absolutely said senior meteorologist Brandon Miller studied global warming decade But everything atmosphere impacted fact warmer ever Miller said There water vapor atmosphere The ocean warmer And really pushes impact one direction worse higher surge storms higher rainfall storms There debate among scientists whether future tropical storms stronger frequent The intensity frequency duration North Atlantic hurricanes increased since early according recent National Climate Assessment periodic report team scientists experts The report also found frequency strongest storms Category hurricanes increased recent decades But scientists say evidence less conclusive The historical Atlantic hurricane record provide compelling evidence substantial greenhouse warming induced long term increase storms said Ryan Maue research meteorologist Cato Institute libertarian think tank In future scientists say necessarily hurricanes potential hurricane related flooding destruction More people research good agreement going Sublette said As go forward time going tendency hurricanes form heavier rain perhaps stronger winds Asked whether appropriate talk climate change hurricane victims suffering Sublette said The public wants know public right know public wants answers I think us give scientifically accurate information possible Hayhoe added You say I believe climate change planet

For example heat waves result heat related illnesses deaths This direct effect climate change Climate change indirect effect infectious diseases climate shifts weather patterns influencing pathogens bacteria viruses etc hosts insects animals consequently humans exposed Opinions ISIS derail Paris climate talksSeveral diseases sensitive climate among diarrheal diseases transmitted insect vectors For example tick carries bacterium responsible Lyme disease expanded range northward United States Canada past years due warming temperatures according study published Journal Applied Ecology Another example Vibrio bacterium The pathogen found naturally warm marine waters responsible diarrheal disease sometimes bloodstream poisoning following consumption raw oysters wound infections swimming seawater These bacteria also expanded range due warming coastal waters The turn century saw Vibrio outbreaks extend far north New England Alaska Records northern Europe also indicate bacteria becoming common Vibrio infections considered indicator climate change U S Global Change Research Program In addition temperature changes precipitation patterns help mobilize pathogens increase chances transmission humans Intense rainfall events flooding drought expected increase projected changes climate affect introduction fecal contaminants recreational waters waters used drinking For example

student phrased question way Is climate change associated treacherous natural disasters currently experiencing Attributing extreme weather events climate change one important aspects climate change research It also controversial The reason latter It difficult prove single weather event caused humans burning fossil fuels warming planet After extreme weather occurred planet long humans started interfering climate system But scientists clear extreme weather events influenced global warming How decide normal Let look recent example historic flooding Southeast particularly South Carolina North Carolina The record rains blamed deaths least people hundreds thousands put boil water advisory contamination water supplies Was flooding caused climate change We know sure least yet More research needed But know event fingerprints climate change This flooding contained combination several extreme weather events expect occur frequently result global warming including extreme precipitation e lot rain falling short amount time coastal flooding The South Carolina governor called event one year flood means likelihood type event occurring given year But according Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change return periods decreasing warm planet likely events occur This planet warms water vapor atmosphere hold adding rain big storms Therefore year event may become like year event Indeed seen numerous high profile examples extreme rainfall events recently including France Japan Boulder Colorado The flooding South Carolina worsened coastal inundation particularly Charleston combination strong winds partly associated nearby Hurricane Joaquin high tides caused ocean water flood much city Once clear climate change connection flooding sea levels Charleston risen foot past century according NOAA clearly added destruction storm system able bring This gives us clear example coastal cities affected climate change especially extreme storms saw New Jersey Superstorm Sandy The IPCC

another good reason regularly eat meatless meals By filling plate plant foods instead animal foods help save planet One study published October journal Nature found result population growth continued

ecosystems could become unstable according study author Marco Springmann Oxford Martin Programme Future Food University Oxford It could lead dangerous levels climate change higher occurrences extreme weather events affect regulatory function forest ecosystems biodiversity pollute water bodies would lead oxygen depleted dead zones oceans Springmann said If whole world continues grow eats like us impacts staggering planet simply withstand said Sharon Palmer registered dietitian nutritionist plant based food sustainability expert Los Angeles involved new research Sustaining healthier planet require halving amount food loss waste improving farming practices technologies But also require shift toward plant based diets according Springmann As Palmer noted research consistently shows drastically reducing animal food intake mostly eating plant foods one powerful things reduce impact planet lifetime terms energy required land used greenhouse gas emissions water used pollutants produced How meat based diet negatively affects environment It might come surprise Springmann study found production animal products generates majority food related greenhouse gas emissions specifically total agricultural emissions This explained due manure related emissions low feed conversion efficiencies meaning cows animals efficient converting eat body weight enteric fermentation ruminants process takes place cow stomach digests food leads methane emissions The feed related impacts animal products also contribute freshwater use pressures cropland well nitrogen phosphorus application time could lead dead zones oceans low oxygen areas organisms survive according Springmann For example animal foods compare plant based foods terms environmental effects consider beef times emissions intensive legumes Springmann said This cow needs average kilograms feed often grains grow kilogram body weight feed required water land fertilizer inputs grow In addition cows emit potent greenhouse gas methane digestion makes cows ruminants sheep especially high emitting Other animal foods lower impacts produce methane stomachs require less feed cows Springmann explained For example cows emit times greenhouse gases per kilogram meat pigs chickens emit times legumes Like animals plants also require inputs environment order grow magnitude significantly less Springmann explained In today agricultural system grow plants feed animals require resources inputs land water fossil fuels pesticides herbicides fertilizer grow And feed plants animals care lifetime produce methane manure Palmer said Adopting plant based diets could reduce greenhouse gas emissions food system half according Nature study A mainly plant based diet could also reduce environmental impacts fertilizers save quarter use farmland fresh water according Springmann Palmer explained legumes pulses beans lentils peas sustainable protein source planet They require small amounts water grow grow harsh dry climates grow poor nations providing food security act like natural fertilizer capturing nitrogen air fixing soil Thus less need synthetic fertilizers These types protein sources need rely upon often Flexitarian The healthy compromise planetExperts agree ready give meat entirely flexitarian diet predominantly plant based help This diet includes plenty fruits vegetables plant based protein sources including legumes soybeans nuts along modest amounts poultry fish milk eggs small amounts red meat Vegetarian vegan diets would result even lower greenhouse gas emissions flexitarian diet least stringent healthy would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough us stay within environmental limits according Springmann Palmer said although vegan diets followed vegetarian diets linked lowest environmental impacts everyone interested taking lifestyles But everyone eat flexitarian diet It mean give meat completely significantly reduce intake Registered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner described way A flexitarian really someone wakes intention vegetarian It different vegetarian flexibility Going flexitarian Just flexitarian wish flexible For example Blatner involved Nature

reduce emissions harmful gases like carbon dioxide consumed headlines But many scientists say simply minimizing man made pollution enough limit global warming two degrees Celsius agreed Paris climate agreement humans must also devise means help cool planet There shortage imaginative proposals achieve goal Some involve sucking carbon dioxide atmosphere others including giant space based solar shield would reduce amount sunlight reaches Earth While many solutions considered radical impractical others operational years But given often high costs significant side effects vast scale international impact plenty skepticism viability existing options There way around reducing emissions said Stefan Schaefer climate engineering program leader Institute Advanced Sustainability Studies Potsdam Germany Without none techniques anything useful None silver bullet added But investing money research approaches makes sense Here existing technologies look realistic Scrubbing airWhile projects remove carbon dioxide source power stations gas fields enters atmosphere direct air capture DAC involves taking CO air storing often underground reservoirs Chemical techniques capturing CO scrubbing using alkaline absorb CO already used power stations could transferable DAC projects Other suggested methods include using artificial trees suck carbon building towers suck air filter CO Pros Far reaching DAC combat emissions disparate sources including homes vehicles single points power stations Mobile Since technology targets CO atmosphere DAC facilities set anywhere Earth Cons High costs Factoring building plants assembling new infrastructure DAC expensive financially terms energy input Storage risks Some scientists worried storing CO underground possibility leaks question would responsible monitoring gas time How realistic Unlike technologies DAC made beyond drawing board The world first commercially operational DAC plant opened Switzerland May Fans suck air filters absorb carbon dioxide The gas piped greenhouses used fertilizer grow crops But Schaefer skeptical scope technology The question direct air capture much actually achieve How much CO actually remove atmosphere And extent would scale impact global climate Building hundreds thousands DAC plants would take vast amounts energy materials produce CO process contributing problem plants meant help solve Richard Darton emeritus professor co director Oxford Geoengineering Programme University Oxford hopeful He said plants use renewable energy run carbon footprint could small Good old fashioned treesIt may seem outdated tree planting vital tool battle climate change one simplest possible solutions While reforestation reintroduces trees land recently deforested afforestation means planting trees areas without forests long time never supported forests Trees take store carbon dioxide reducing concentration gas atmosphere Pros Low cost Afforestation one simplest cheapest ways remove CO atmosphere Feasible Some countries already small short term afforestation projects could easily expanded replicated elsewhere Side effects Alongside positive effect climate planting trees brings plenty benefits including job creation enhancement soil fertility Cons More expensive food Mass afforestation could lead food price rises competition land More warming Changing grassland forest darkens area Earth surface meaning sun energy absorbed could help raise rather reduce Earth temperature Side effects Habitats destroyed ecosystems disrupted unpredictable long term consequences How realistic A useful first step stop cutting trees first place Schaefer said That still happening large scale Darton agrees sees great value encouraging afforestation land suitable But new areas forest vast influence global climate generating problems described positive effects permanent There always problem lifetime forest carbon go back atmosphere said Darton It may gain us decades need long term solution Just add limeAdding lime alkaline materials ocean could another way removing CO air This technology known ocean alkalinity enhancement Rocks limestone silicates would ground dispersed ocean increase ability store carbon The limestone first quarried broken quicklime high temperatures process also produces carbon dioxide But quicklime dumped seawater scientists say absorb around twice much CO released first reaction Pros Permanent The gas reacts rock underwater becomes inorganic means stays ocean permanently Double win Adding lime oceans could also help fix rising ocean acidity dangerous side effect rising CO emissions well reducing CO levels atmosphere Cons Logistics To achieve significant impact climate huge amounts limestone would need quarried transported broken New CO produced While reducing CO levels long term process generates carbon dioxide Side effects The effects existing ecosystems developed adapt increasingly acidic environment unpredictable could severe How realistic More people becoming interested technology explained Schaefer said tackling ocean acidification something geoengineering options But Schaefer Darton fearful effects world seas Many us quite nervous distributing chemicals maritime environment said Darton We know awful lot sea react changes chemistry To make significant inroads carbon reduction ocean alkalinity enhancement would deployed large scale Darton said research needed longer term effects approach I doubtful something could long term said Parasols spaceBack American James Early suggested putting giant sunshade space offset effect greenhouse gases Earth atmosphere He envisioned glass refractor large heavy would built moon More recent proposals designed reduce amount sunlight reaching planet include swarm thin metallic reflecting discs Saturn like ring dust particles injected space Earth superfine mesh aluminum threads Scientists estimate reducing amount sunlight reaching Earth could offset effects CO levels atmosphere doubling Pros Immediate effect Once place sun shield would reduce temperature Earth atmosphere quickly within years Unlimited potential In theory limit level global temperature rise solar shield could combat Cons High costs Deployment costs would higher geoengineering technologies Timeliness It take decades ever approaches become reality huge logistical demands Side effects The knock effects regional climates hydrological cycles could significant How realistic Right far science fiction anything else said Schaefer At point future might something people would consider long way road Any space based solar shield would face huge financial costs logistical problems explained Darton pointed another problem common solar radiation management projects If turn modeling shows temperature rises rapidly said If implement technologies wedded Injections sulfurAerosols tiny particles less millionth meter wide suspended atmosphere Man made aerosols exist hairspray spray paint come natural sources Many natural aerosols found atmosphere scatter light sun sending sun energy back space This process exerts cooling effect earth climate By artificially injecting sulfate particles type aerosol atmosphere using fighter planes giant balloons scientists could increase amount sunlight sent back space intensify cooling effect Pros Mimics natural process Pumping extra aerosols atmosphere replicates happens volcano erupts explosively natural event cause temperatures drop temporarily Reverse melting Current climate trends melting sea ice rising sea levels could reversed Cons Ozone damage Sulfate aerosols stratosphere produce sulfuric acid damages ozone layer That means less sun ultraviolet rays absorbed increasing risk skin cancer eye damage High costs The costs getting particles stratosphere could huge ongoing Side effects The technology could cause regional drought produce less sunlight solar power make skies less blue How realistic Schaefer think see technology within next years In fact would concerning development added The technical side things seem difficult resolve Schaefer said seems much difficult social political side That basically insurmountable Even one country funds implements aerosol program consequences could felt around world Who would take responsibility harms caused intervention Schaefer asked', 'Eric Madrid teaches advanced sciences including topics climate change

newsletter And thank John Sutter columnist Q Will climate change cause ocean food chain collapse October Question William Breyer Indian Harbour Beach FloridaAnswer Jennifer Gray MeteorologistAnswer Yes according recent study Adelaide University Australia Why Well know carbon dioxide increasing globally oceans absorb huge amounts CO year When happens pH levels ocean reduced That CO acid gas dissolves water including seawater forms carbonic acid As CO dissolves oceans fundamentally alters ocean chemistry making acidic This acid addition name ocean acidification comes ocean pH declining worldwide One marine ecologist studied issue says warmer waters creating higher metabolic rates turn creating bigger demand food Read Jennifer Gray detailed answer hereQ Were South Carolina floods caused climate change October Question Sital Sathia Chicago IllinoisAnswer Brandon Miller meteorologist InternationalAnswer Attributing extreme weather events climate change one important aspects climate change research It also controversial The reason latter It difficult prove single weather event caused humans burning fossil fuels warming planet After extreme weather occurred planet long humans started interfering climate system But scientists clear extreme weather events influenced global warming Was recent devastating flooding South Carolina caused climate change We know sure least yet More research needed But know event fingerprints climate change This flooding contained combination several extreme weather events expect occur frequently result global warming including extreme precipitation e lot rain falling short amount time coastal flooding Read Brandon Miller detailed answer hereQ Does eating bugs help fight climate change October Question Torben rvad Jensen DenmarkAnswer John D Sutter columnistAnswer A study shows mealworms smaller carbon footprint per kilogram edible protein milk pork chicken beef Beef example carbon footprint six times size mealworms per kilogram edible protein study says Dutch entomologist Dennis Oonincx published study told results likely would similar edible crickets grown farms way help combat global food insecurity Scientific research quantified exactly much crickets contribute climate change although Oonincx points crickets likely would slightly larger carbon footprint similar pork milk Read John Sutter detailed answer Q Why conservative Christians believe climate change September Question Wayne Stoll Ladysmith WisconsinAnswer John D Sutter columnistAnswer Climate change problem longer left future generation That one religious leader Pope speaking front White House But Wayne Stoll reader Wisconsin points week Two question conservative Christian leaders joined Pope Francis issue Many see climate change moral outrage cause urgent action Take Cornwall Alliance wrote open letter Pope Francis April urging support efforts rid world fossil fuels Such policies group wrote would condemn hundreds millions fellow human beings ongoing poverty We respectfully appeal advise world leaders reject The group letter also rejects mainstream climate science saying computer models provide rational basis forecast dangerous human induced global warming These views seem reflected among churchgoers conservative Christians less likely accept mainstream climate science says climate warming humans largely blame And even among religious Republicans apparent split Catholics Protestants Catholic Republicans example likely say global warming happening non Catholic Republican counterparts according survey Yale Project Climate Change Communication Catholics nonevangelical Protestants United States according group also likely say humans causing climate change evangelicals So religious climate doubters justify views I got window earlier year I spent week Woodward County Oklahoma highly religious statistically one climate skeptical places United States I met conservative Christians Woodward County see climate change sign end times They think happening see God punishment upside world therefore think anything Others seemed almost humble accept climate science They said humans small insignificant face knowing Creator actually alter global climactic system For others rejecting mainstream climate science seems matter politics You hear climate doubters words video Woodward The underlying message much God control Humans possibly messing things bad But rebuttal argument The answer pretty simple It free Katharine Hayhoe evangelical Christian climate scientist Texas Tech told NPR God gave us brains make good choices consequences choices make Meanwhile religious leaders stripes continue call action Muslim scholars example recently issued Islamic Declaration Global Climate Change prods world leaders move quickly slash carbon emissions zero W e become force dominating nature write Our species though selected caretaker steward Earth cause corruption devastation danger ending life know planet And diversity thought among conservative Christians It God love calls us take challenge says letter posted website Evangelical Environmental Network addressed President Obama That write offer support encouragement efforts overcome climate challenge Perhaps conservative religious leaders start speaking Q What U S presidential contenders think global warming September Question Randy McNamara San FranciscoAnswer John D Sutter columnistAnswer We got yet another frightening glimpse week Republican debate U S presidential contenders think think climate science Here back forth moderator Jake Tapper Republican Sen Marco Rubio noted skeptic science saying Earth warming causing Tapper Sen Rubio Ronald Reagan secretary state George Shultz reminds us Reagan president faced similar situation one facing There dire warnings mass consensus scientific community ozone layer shrinking Shultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics industry come plan He said Do insurance policy case scientists right The scientists right Reagan approach worked Secretary Shultz asks Why take insurance policy approach climate change Reagan way Rubio Because going destroy economy way left wing government wants We going Tapper I citing Republican George Shultz Rubio Well I may lined positions issue But bottom line Every proposal put forward going proposals make harder business America make harder create jobs America Maybe billionaire California afford increase utility rates working family Tampa Florida anywhere across country cannot afford The obvious irony Florida Rubio state among vulnerable rising seas associated increase global temperatures caused humans A recent study found burned available fossil fuels Florida would almost completely underwater Rubio Jake called denier Tapper I called skeptic Rubio OK skeptic You measure climate You measure That issue discussing Here I skeptical I skeptical decisions left wants us make I know impact going going economy They thing lower rise sea They thing cure drought California But make America expensive place create jobs From exchange maybe get sense difficult answer reader Randy McNamara question presidential candidates stand climate change As science climate change become abundantly clear climate warming potentially disastrous consequences human fossil fuel emissions main cause U S presidential hopefuls gotten better dodging attempts classify It seems none wants labeled denier skeptic even policies suggest otherwise Rubio acknowledge climate change happening actually clear past I believe human activity causing dramatic changes climate way scientists portraying told ABC Jonathan Karl Other candidates made similar anti science statements later tried soften stances The concept global warming created Chinese make U S manufacturing noncompetitive Donald Trump tweeted November He later told Tapper State Union tweet meant sarcastic But Trump also told Tapper huge believer global warming phenomena This stuff exhausting right There several candidates among Democrats Hillary Clinton Martin O Malley Bernie Sanders well Republican Lindsey Graham clearly stated acknowledge reality climate science crucially would work curb fossil fuel emissions When doctors tell got problem listen one Graham told Dana Bash State Union June At end day I believe CO emission problem world hurting environment But solution pro business solution lower carbon economy I encourage others make positions clear And I ask journalists continue push Tapper Wednesday specific statements whether candidates believe humans causing climate change burning fossil fuels would The American public including McNamara reader San Francisco deserves much higher level discourse crucial topic Q Who scientists believe climate change caused people September Question Mark D Raleigh North CarolinaAnswer Brandon Miller meteorologist InternationalAnswer We hear term scientific consensus bantered lot discussing climate change number refers percentage active climate scientists believe people causing climate change burning fossil fuels widely cited There NASA page dissecting touting figure Even President Barack Obama tweeted But number actually come And scientists First number comes There studies surveys found overwhelming majority scientists study climate change agree climate warming humans responsible One largest widely referenced studies published Peter Doran Maggie Kendall Zimmerman These researchers polled Earth scientists asking simply believed planet warming human activity significant contributor changing global temperature The scientists came variety fields within Earth science geology oceanography paleontology meteorology name Ninety percent Ph D master degrees Nine scientists said global temperatures rising said rise human activities burning fossil fuels putting heat trapping gases atmosphere But stop To gauge view scientists expertise authors also looked specifically responses climate science experts meaning published research field For group consensus even striking More agreed humans causing Earth temperature rise Two Five techniques climate change denialResearchers keep getting similar results An exhaustive review published research climate change performed study John Cook The study looked nearly published studies years across number scientific peer reviewed journals containing words global warming global climate change Of studies approximately one third stated position whether climate change caused humans stated position subject research showed humans causing climate change Mark D reader North Carolina asked also wanted know specifically whether fair say climate scientists bias simply climate scientists It interesting point worth noting science dedicated independent thinking Scientists test replicate question hypotheses And perhaps counterintuitively actually incentive try disprove deeply held scientific theories They able climate change When people say scientists promote climate change get grant money immediate sign understand grants funded Marshall Shepherd director Atmospheric Sciences program University Georgia publisher research studies climate change wrote email It would actually best interest scientists say funding source We know human caused climate change happening fund us figure Two The climate skeptical place America Scientists trying question understanding subject science cataloging ongoing discovery But best understanding science overwhelmingly indicates climate changing humans likely blame That shown research among views experts climate science To wrap consider More scientific associations world including U S National Academy Sciences World Meteorological Organization U N Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change support consensus Have climate question Ask question might answered next week', 'columnist John D Sutter spending rest year reporting tiny number degrees may huge effect future planet He like help Subscribe

front passes mean end world said Mark Lynas author book called Six Degrees Our Future Hotter Planet But raise global average surface temperatures degrees pre industrial levels Lynas told create scenario extreme almost unimaginable Most planetary surface would functionally uninhabitable said Agriculture would cease exist everywhere apart polar sub polar regions perhaps mid latitudes extremely heat tolerant crops It difficult see crops could grown elsewhere There certain level plants survive There certain level humans biologically survive outside well The oceans would probably stratify oceans would become oxygen deficient would cause mass extinction die oceans well would release gases affect land So pretty much equivalent meteorite striking planet terms overall impacts I chatted Lynas science writer UK avoid degree world international goal limiting global warming degrees talk kids climate change The following edited transcript conversation For background This interview came Lynas book one chosen readers book club part degrees series climate change To follow along shape coverage sign degrees newsletter Lynas agreed take questions week June Sutter I gotten lot questions readers degrees warming means What mean sea levels What mean hurricanes Extinctions Those sorts things Could I run couple get take someone read mountains research Lynas Sure sure I best Sutter OK Could start extinctions What see around degree mark In marine environment I think threatened ecosystems coral reefs They threatened coral bleaching due rising temperatures ocean acidification plus general degradation everyday general human activity It tough imagine world coral reefs continue exist present day form degree warmer world The threatened environments probably mountain ecosystems species left marooned shrinking islands habitat As temperature rises imagine biomes rising sides mountains species dependent certain level temperature humidity get left nowhere go Sutter What hurricanes severe weather There really lot uncertainty It possible imagine hurricanes become less frequent intense possibly form new areas Sutter What droughts I get lot California questions Lynas The overall global picture kind unto given unto shall taken away want get biblical That maps subtropics already drier parts globe become water deficient The deep tropics actually get rainfall well mid latitudes But subtropics southwest U S would expect see less rainfall indeed seems happening That call question really development model large areas southwestern U S adopted expecting large amount freshwater available urban areas agriculture already pretty arid location So I think going hard adapt change Sutter I also gotten questions low lying Pacific Island nations At degrees fate Lynas I used adviser president Maldives way jail due coup But challenge main agenda president bring attention fate small island states especially coral atolls For Maldives entire country exists meter less sea level little It difficult imagine survival coral atoll nations degrees said Although extinction process depends rate sea level rise It might take decades might take centuries clear moment But I think long term future Sutter Moving degree ladder describe degree world sixth circle hell What mean describe know world Lynas It scenario extreme almost unimaginable Not many studies addressed far scale envisaged I found looking back really serious traumatic events Earth geological history led mass extinctions one end Permian period million years ago wiped nearly life Earth Actually lot mass extinctions seem associated rapid global warming events Humans releasing carbon rapidly even took place mass extinctions We gotten terms overall amount certainly moving direction So planet I think us would want live happen While I think important try visualize degree world would look like also important remember go Sutter What else know degree world Lynas Most planetary surface would functionally uninhabitable Agriculture would cease exist everywhere apart polar subpolar regions perhaps mid latitudes extremely heat tolerant crops It difficult see crops could grown elsewhere There certain level plants survive There certain level humans biologically survive outside well We get close enough already Arabian Peninsula parts world Remember degrees global average It would probably twice land somewhat less oceans The oceans would probably stratify oceans would become oxygen deficient would cause mass extinction die oceans well would release gases affect land So pretty much equivalent meteorite striking planet terms overall impacts Sutter I wondering took approach looking climate change degrees Lynas A lot people want know warming get emissions path warming might get date That pretty fundamentally uncertain depend different factors well quantified I felt looking degree degree much robust If temperature rises X amount Y impacts There three major sources information One observational changes already seeing terms impacts temperature rise The second computer models showing different ecosystem changes whatever And third paleoclimate sources looking climate different earlier hotter periods geologic time So piecing together mapping onto degree degree picture seemed way try convey visual intuitive also highly scientifically appropriate way Sutter What think world focus degree mark One activist said degrees thing international community agrees upon climate change Lynas I think important target focuses policy focuses people efforts And makes sense also target based temperature But something meet definition We simple thermostat decide exactly much carbon emit exact temperature result dependent So uncertainty really level emissions lead temperature outcomes However I think degrees really absolute upper limit tolerable terms ecosystems probably adaptive capacities human societies A degree world world without coral reefs much less snow ice fairly dramatic heatwaves impacts So I would like see global warming future warming actually lower personally Sutter Do think possible Lynas I think possible It likely If current understanding climate sensitivity broadly correct probably going come degrees somewhere end century I guess good news absolutely calamitous degree outcomes particularly unlikely although still possible And certainly risk happening higher risk airplane crashing get onto Sutter Wait saying risk degrees warming doomsday scenario higher airplane crashing Lynas Well likelihood airplane crashing I know one million something order magnitude Whereas likelihood coming within degrees warming probably It sort risk one would tolerate personal level But perhaps diffuse responsibility feel tolerable species take gamble whole planet Maybe think nothing And built optimism bias included like think things turn right often tend And meantime go lives normal It big ask I guess make society whole forgo main energy source enjoy fossil fuels order forestall uncertain impacts decades future Sutter One things struck book surprised people depressed climate change Isn pretty depressing subject It really matter whether find depressing scientific reality We deal A thing like climate change known wicked problem It seen differently different people according psychological political cultural biases You frame technology challenge Let get fossil fuels let get onto renewables nuclear easy Or frame moral challenge We trespassing rights future generations dare Or see political challenge somehow big fossil fuel corporations transgressing democracy forcing us stay hooked oil coal gas Different people according politics see climate change fundamentally way It simple problem understand Sutter So look Do ever find climate change overwhelming depressing personally Well I pragmatist I think solvable problem I think need abandon capitalism change entire political system order tackle challenge Other people I disagree And debates late night But I think next generation nuclear technologies particularly way solar power developing rapidly rapidly coming cost quickly technology improving zero carbon options becoming much widely available bring emissions much rapidly people think people thought years ago I think point pessimistic Pessimistic people achieve anything It important possible quickly Sutter What make way world responding Lynas We inhabiting human dominated planet We new epoch known Anthropocene The Holocene considered And I think really another species effect planet maybe first bacteria emitted oxygen photosynthesizing microorganisms But really terra incognita looking forward That gives species serious level responsibility planetary management people really appreciate kind fundamental physiological political level We charge It us We actually overall effect earth temp It Mother Nature anymore run show Sutter Do children Lynas Yeah The reason I distracted minute ago kids came back school Sutter Do talk What say Lynas I talk bit They know I Younger generations grown specter It bit like us older grew Cold War threat nuclear annihilation So entirely different situation I suppose previous generations You could feel bad future generations hand I sure future worse future somebody born say likelihood Europe would killed one world wars It manageable problem We beginning get grips There positive signs already China U S agreeing peak emissions things like So counsel despair And I think important talk kids level make think somehow fundamentally doomed That case case Sutter What needs happen ensure things improve What benchmarks looking say OK managing problem We needed Lynas Well I ecomodernist new label lot environmental thinkers beginning attach bit different traditional environmentalism thought somehow doomed fundamentally destructive species We turn around problems well pragmatic approach politics economist especially technology We need price carbon emitting carbon dioxide cheaper energy sources We need invest heavily research development zero carbon sources including next generation nuclear renewable energies especially solar And need deploy ever wider scale increased financing We also need political agreement sense whole world moving right direction All things possible I think fundamentally achievable likely But need keep pressure politicians everyone

William Nordhaus economist Yale Nordhaus proposed degree threshold paper titled Economic Growth Climate The Carbon Dioxide Problem The estimate crude reasonable first start told If global temperatures degrees current average temperature would take climate outside range observations made last several hundred thousand years wrote The Climate Casino A growing body research supports idea How degrees become international standard Science continued raise red flags degrees warming And work led policy experts conclude degree world something none us want You need judgment call things said Carlo Jaeger chair Global Climate Forum written history degrees Celsius And degree thing judgment call happened interface science policy Germany first push degrees policy goal Jaeger told That happened Later came European Commission G U S National Academy Sciences significantly Copenhagen Accord signed nations agreed degrees would much The United States among signatories What would world look like degrees I going spend month May exploring question look But striking facts scientists expect post degree world look like These pulled reports National Research Council Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change World Bank Wildfires United States expected increase size Hurricanes expected become intense A range species risk extinction particularly amphibians The IPCC estimates animals plants species increasingly high risk extinction near degree mark The Arctic expected keep melting losing annual average sea ice Certain crop yields United States India Africa expected decrease The availability freshwater expected decline So good And numbers convey emotional toll I New Mexico said Nordhaus economist proposed degree threshold I love I know going completely different climate The trout fishing probably good The hiking good These forests may look completely different burn I love ski It one things I love And obviously affected warming I love ocean New England coastline peril That starters What happens degrees No one knows exactly Think degrees like sort speed limit zone increased risk Katharine Hayhoe climate scientist Texas Tech told burning fossil fuels like smoking How many cigarettes give cancer No one knows exactly But smoke risk And degrees policy experts agree certainly risky territory Plus everyone hates fraction Targeting degree warming ridiculous said Nordhaus economist Three sounds high And fraction complicated So two kind obvious number How much climate warmed already The climate already warmed degrees since Industrial Revolution And reasonably expect reach degrees simply based pollution already putting atmosphere even ambitious mitigation action reduce carbon emissions according report World Bank Some warming locked Earth atmospheric system organization says The impacts climate change already felt Is possible stay degrees Yes easy If want stay degrees reduce emissions amazing speed incredible degree said Jaeger Global Climate Forum Here best guess amazing speed might need look like Cutting greenhouse gas emissions said Jennifer Morgan global director climate program World Resources Institute It depends much risk want accept said Some activists including org Avaaz together organized largest climate change rally history last year New York want accept less risk Our position clean energy said David Sievers senior campaigner Avaaz What happens take action If continue burning fossil fuels current rate could hit degrees warming midcentury Scarier still could hit degrees warming Some writers called world abandon degree target saying ambitious even naive But need yardstick measure progress need north star help us set goals actually would weighty enough make dent problem If think degrees sounds bad degrees far far worse The IPCC expects degree world characterized major extinctions around globe reconfiguration coastlines worldwide Just beyond degrees looking catastro f would almost infinitely costly said Wagner Environmental

sure decade These votes particularly hoax vote heralded environmental circles including Sen Barbara Boxer D California sign progress like coming party sorts At least senators going record argument goes At least vote said public climate change hoax I sure True would value knowing every senator stands climate change Americans say climate change real know caused people according Pew survey right know elected officials fall many important policy issues But important learned Wednesday We learned senators say climate change happening without blaming humans Among Jim Inhofe R Oklahoma perhaps Washington vocal climate denier He continued streak week Climate changing climate always changed always archaeological evidence biblical evidence Inhofe said Senate floor according Bloomberg News others The hoax people arrogant think powerful change climate Man change climate Helpful huh We also know senators voted amendment saying climate change fact caused human emissions greenhouse gases That could seem like win left least effort pin senators buy science saying humans contribute But among votes Sen Lisa Murkowski R Alaska said reason voting simply word significantly according The Hill The amendment said human activity significantly contributes warming climate That artful dodge And means neither vote offers true clarity These votes witch hunt substance The political left seems want embarrass right denying facts climate change The right Elana Schor Politico smartly noted played brilliantly appearing take Earth flat stance actually ceding next nothing Meanwhile people actually need listening issue politicians They climate scientists saying years climate changing human emissions greenhouse gases driving cause need act urgently cut emissions I hate doom gloom climate politics
